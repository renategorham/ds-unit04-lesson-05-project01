The main aim of our study was to evaluate the effects on endothelial function, lipid profile, and glucose metabolism of two different combinations of nutraceuticals, first one containing Bergavit (200 mg Citrus bergamia), Omega-3 (400 mg), Crominex 3+ (10 mcg trivalent chromium), and red yeast rice (100 mg; 5 mg monacolin K) and second one containing red yeast rice (200 mg; 3 mg monacolin K), Berberine (500 mg), Astaxanthin (0.5 mg), folic acid (200 mcg), Coenzyme Q10 (2 mg), and Policosanol (10 mg). Fifty subjects affected by dyslipidemia not requiring statin treatment were enrolled in this randomized, blind, controlled trial and submitted to blood sampling for lipid and glucose profiles and instrumental evaluation of endothelial function before and after 6 weeks of treatment with nutraceuticals. Both nutraceutical combinations improved the lipid profile; the nutraceutical containing 5 mg of monacolin K, 200 mg of the extract <i>Citrus bergamia</i>, 400 mg of Omega-3, and 10 mcg of trivalent chromium entailed a significant improvement of endothelial function with enhanced cholesterol lowering effect. In conclusion, this study confirms the positive effect of functional food on lipid profile and endothelial function in absence of major undesirable effects."

30721768,geriatrics,"Both endocannabinoids and insulin regulate peripheral and cerebral glucose homeostasis via convergent signaling pathways that are impacted by diabetes. Here we asked how glucose metabolism and important facets of insulin signaling are affected in the forebrain of cannabinoid CB<sub>1</sub> receptor knockout mice (CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO) and their wild-type (WT) littermates, seven weeks after the induction of insulinopenia/hyperglycemia (diabetes) with intraperitoneal streptozotocin injection. Sham-injected animals served as control. Diabetes caused milder weight loss in the WT mice compared to the phenotypically ˜11% leaner CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO, while hyperglycemia was similar. Resting [<sup>3</sup>H]deoxyglucose uptake was significantly reduced by ˜20% in acute ex vivo frontocortical and hippocampal slices obtained from both the sham-injected CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO and the diabetic WT mice. Surprisingly, the third cohort, the diabetic CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO showed no further impairment in glucose uptake, as compared to the sham-injected CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO. Depolarization-induced [<sup>3</sup>H]deoxyglucose uptake was proportional to the respective resting values only in the cortex in all four cohorts. The dissipative metabolism of [<sup>14</sup>C]-U-glucose remained largely unaffected in all cohorts of animals. However, diabetes reduced cortical CB<sub>1</sub>R density by ˜20%, as assessed by Western blotting. Albeit the changes in insulin signaling did not reflect the glucose uptake profile in each cohort, there were significant interactions between diabetes and genotype. In conclusion, a chronic decrease or lack of CB<sub>1</sub>R expression reduces glucose uptake in the mouse brain. Additionally, diabetes failed to cause further impairment in cerebral glucose uptake in the CB<sub>1</sub>R-KO. These suggest that diabetic encephalopathy may be in part associated with lower CB<sub>1</sub>R expression."

30721141,geriatrics,"Background Procalcitonin (PCT)-guided antibiotic stewardship (ABS) has been shown to reduce antibiotics (ABxs), with lower side-effects and an improvement in clinical outcomes. The aim of this experts workshop was to derive a PCT algorithm ABS for easier implementation into clinical routine across different clinical settings. Methods Clinical evidence and practical experience with PCT-guided ABS was analyzed and discussed, with a focus on optimal PCT use in the clinical context and increased adherence to PCT protocols. Using a Delphi process, the experts group reached consensus on different PCT algorithms based on clinical severity of the patient and probability of bacterial infection. Results The group agreed that there is strong evidence that PCT-guided ABS supports individual decisions on initiation and duration of ABx treatment in patients with acute respiratory infections and sepsis from any source, thereby reducing overall ABx exposure and associated side effects, and improving clinical outcomes. To simplify practical application, the expert group refined the established PCT algorithms by incorporating severity of illness and probability of bacterial infection and reducing the fixed cut-offs to only one for mild to moderate and one for severe disease (0.25 μg/L and 0.5 μg/L, respectively). Further, guidance on interpretation of PCT results to initiate, withhold or discontinue ABx treatment was included. Conclusions A combination of clinical patient assessment with PCT levels in well-defined ABS algorithms, in context with continuous education and regular feedback to all ABS stakeholders, has the potential to improve the diagnostic and therapeutic management of patients suspected of bacterial infection, thereby improving ABS effectiveness."
30721133,geriatrics,"Vitamin D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) < 50 nmol/l or 20 ng/ml), is common in Europe and the Middle East. It occurs in < 20 % of the population in Northern Europe, in 30-60% in Western, Southern and Eastern Europe and up to 80 % in Middle East countries. Severe deficiency (serum 25(OH)D < 30 nmol/l or 12 ng/ml) is found in > 10 % of Europeans. The ECTS advises that the measurement of serum 25(OH)D be standardized e.g. by the Vitamin D Standardization Program. Risk groups include young children, adolescents, pregnant women, older people, especially the institutionalized, and non-western immigrants. Consequences of vitamin D deficiency include mineralization defects and lower bone mineral density causing fractures. Extra-skeletal consequences may be muscle weakness, falls and acute respiratory infection, and are the subject of large ongoing clinical trials. The ECTS advises to improve vitamin D status by food fortification and the use of vitamin D supplements in risk groups. Fortification of foods by adding vitamin D to dairy products, bread and cereals can improve the vitamin D status of the whole population, but quality assurance monitoring is needed to prevent intoxication. Specific risk groups such as infants and children up to 3 years, pregnant women, older persons and non-western immigrants should routinely receive vitamin D supplements. Future research should include genetic studies to better define individual vulnerability for vitamin D deficiency, and Mendelian randomization studies to address the effect of vitamin D deficiency on long term non-skeletal outcomes such as cancer."

30720104,geriatrics,"The present study aimed to assess the protective effects of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) on the livers of mice fed a high fat diet. The mice were divided into five groups: Regular diet; high fat diet; simvastatin‑treated; and low and high dose TMP‑treated groups. The results demonstrated that, compared with the control group, serum glucose, total cholesterol (TC) and low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased in the model group. Additionally, compared with the model group, simvastatin lowered the TC level, whereas TMP did not. Compared with the control group, the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) in the liver tissue was increased and the level of glutathione peroxidase (GSH‑pX) in the liver tissue was decreased in the model group. Furthermore, compared with the model group, TMP decreased the level of MDA and increased the level of GSH‑Px; however, simvastatin did not have these effects. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting were performed; the results showed that, compared with the control group, the levels of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor‑α and interleukin‑6) in the liver tissue were increased, and the ratio of phosphorylated (p)‑nuclear factor κB (NF‑κB)/NF‑κB was also increased in the model group. The addition of TMP and simvastatin demonstrated that, compared with the model group, the inflammatory factor levels and the ratio of p‑NF‑κB/NF‑κB were decreased. In addition, liver lipid deposition was examined in the model group using hematoxylin and eosin staining and Oil Red O staining, and the results showed that TMP and simvastatin reduced liver lipid deposition. Furthermore, compared with the control group, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) level in the liver tissue was increased. Compared with that in the model group, TMP and simvastatin decreased the ROS level. In conclusion, TMP, similar to simvastatin, exerted a notable hepatoprotective effect on mice fed a high fat diet with non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease, by inhibiting inflammatory factors and the p‑NF‑κB/ROS signaling pathway."

We conducted this study to determine the impact of the frailty on subsequent mortality and readmission in this setting. This study was a prospective observational study conducted in the acute geriatric wards, with a three-year follow-up duration. We assessed frailty via the 36-item Frailty Index (FI), and a cut-off value of 0.25 was used to identify the presence or absence of frailty. We collected survival and readmission information through telephone interviews at 12, 24, and 36 months. We used the Cox regression model to examine the association between frailty and outcomes interested (death and readmission). The present study included 271 patients (mean age: 81.1 years old; 20.3% females), of whom 21.4% died during the 3-year follow-up period. One hundred and thirty-three patients (49.1%) were identified as being frail. The prevalence of frailty was similar in men and women (46.8% vs.58.2%, P = 0.130). Compared with non-frail patients, death and hospital readmission rates of frail patients were increased. Frailty was an independent predictor of 3-year death (adjusted hazard ratio (HR): 2.09; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.20 to 3.63) and readmission (adjusted HR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.88) after adjusting for several potential confounders.

30717287,geriatrics,"Atypical antipsychotics, such as olanzapine, are commonly prescribed to patients with schizophrenic symptoms and other psychiatric disorders. However, weight gain and metabolic disturbance cause adverse effects, impair patient compliance and limit clinical utility. Thus, a better understanding of treatment-acquired adverse effects and identification of targets for therapeutic intervention are believed to offer more clinical benefits for patients with schizophrenia. Beyond its nutritional effects, studies have indicated that supplementation of chromium brings about beneficial outcomes against numerous metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated whether olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic disturbance involved chromium dynamic mobilization in a female Sprague-Dawley rat model, and whether a dietary supplement of chromium improved olanzapine-acquired adverse effects. Olanzapine medicated rats experienced weight gain and adiposity, as well as the development of hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, and inflammation. The olanzapine-induced metabolic disturbance was accompanied by a decrease in hepatic Akt and AMP-activated Protein Kinase (AMPK) actions, as well as an increase in serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), along with tissue chromium depletion. A daily intake of chromium supplements increased tissue chromium levels and thermogenic uncoupling protein-1 (UCP-1) expression in white adipose tissues, as well as improved both post-olanzapine weight gain and metabolic disturbance. Our findings suggest that olanzapine medicated rats showed a disturbance of tissue chromium homeostasis by inducing tissue depletion and urinary excretion. This loss may be an alternative mechanism responsible for olanzapine-induced weight gain and metabolic disturbance."

30714090,geriatrics,"Conflicting evidence exists on the epidemiology of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) among patients with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study measured the prevalence, incidence and clinical outcomes associated with T2DM in a large US population of commercially-insured adults aged ≥20 years with SCD between 2009 and 2014. Among 7070 patients with SCD, the mean age (median) was 39 (37) years and 60·8% were female. The standardized prevalence of T2DM among patients with SCD showed a modest increase, from 15·7% to 16·5% (P trend = 0·026), and was comparable to African-American respondents to the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (18·2%). Over 17 024 person-years, the crude incidence rate for T2DM was 25·4 per 1000 person-years. Incident T2DM was associated with comorbid hypertension (hazard ratio [HR] = 1·45, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1·14-1·83), and dyslipidaemia (HR = 1·43, 95%CI 1·04-1·96). Compared to SCD patients without T2DM, more SCD patients with T2DM had diagnoses of nephropathy (28·0% vs. 9·5%; P < 0·001), neuropathy (17·7% vs. 5·2%; P < 0·001) and stroke (24·1% vs. 9·2%; P < 0·001). Prevalence of T2DM in SCD patients is similar to the general African American population with an increasing trend in recent years. These trends support routine screening for T2DM in aging patients with SCD, especially those with comorbid hypertension and/or dyslipidaemia."
30713416,geriatrics,"Geographic differences in cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality among African Americans (AAs) are well-established, but not well-characterized. Using the Minnesota Heart Survey (MHS) and Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, we aimed to assess whether CVD risk factors drive geographic disparities in CVD mortality among AAs. ARIC risk factors were measured between1987-1989 from a population-based sample of AAs, aged 45 to 64 years, living in Jackson, MS and Forsyth County, NC. Similar measures were made at MHS baseline, 1985, in AAs from Minneapolis-St. Paul, MN. CVD mortality was identified using ICD codes for underlying cause of death. We compared MHS and ARIC on CVD death rates using Poisson regression, risk factor prevalences, and hazard ratios using Cox regression. After CVD risk factor adjustment, AA men in MHS had 3.4 (95% CI: 2.1, 4.7) CVD deaths per 1000 person-years vs 9.9 (95% CI: 8.7, 11.1) in ARIC. AA women in MHS had 2.7 (95% CI: 1.8, 3.6) CVD deaths per 1000 person-years vs 6.7 (95% CI: 6.0, 7.4) in ARIC. A 2-fold higher CVD mortality rate remained in ARIC vs MHS after additional adjustment for education and income. ARIC had higher total cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes, and BMI, as well as less education and income than MHS. Risk factor hazard ratios of CVD death did not differ. The CVD death rate was lower in AAs in Minnesota (MHS) than AAs in the Southeast (ARIC). While our findings support maintaining low risk for CVD prevention, differences in CVD mortality reflect unidentified geographic variation."

This article describes the psychiatry of old age specialist training programs in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. These training programs have varying durations, ranging from 1 to 3 years. Although it may not be a mandatory requirement to complete a psychiatry of old age clinical rotation, psychiatry of old age experience and competencies are expected during general psychiatry training. There is generally a lack of opportunity to learn about other clinical specialties relevant to older adults, such as geriatric medicine and neurology.

This study explored the perspectives of oldest-old Swedish men on what a 'good old age' and ageing successfully meant to them. A purposive sample of 17 men, aged 85-90 years, was drawn from the Uppsala Longitudinal Study of Adult Men. An interview guide explored participants' perspectives on their ageing experiences and how they viewed ageing successfully. Participants were interviewed twice, with 1-2 weeks between interviews, and both interviews were recorded and transcribed. Content analysis identified four themes: i) Adaptation, concerning the ability to adapt to growing old with increasing limitations; ii) Sustaining Independence, related to financial resources and good health as the foundation for independence; iii) Belongingness, representing close relationships, established friendships, and the significance of the spouse; and iv) Perspectives of Time, also a common thread in all themes, in which past life experiences create an existential link between the past, the present and the future, establishing continuity of the self and enhancing life satisfaction. The participants presented themselves as active agents involved in maintaining meaning and achieving life satisfaction; a process related to the ability to manage changes in life. Our findings have resonance with models of healthy or successful ageing, but also diverge in important ways, since such models do not consider the significance of an individual's life history for their present well-being, and primarily conceptualise health as an outcome, rather than as a resource."

Nine AD patients and nine controls underwent 90 min [<sup>18</sup>F]THK5317 scans. SUVR-1 was calculated at transient equilibrium (TE) and for seven different 20 min intervals and compared with distribution volume ratio (DVR; reference Logan). Cerebellar grey matter (MRI) was used as reference region. A supervised cluster analysis (SVCA) method was implemented to automatically generate a reference region, directly from the dynamic PET volume without the need of a structural MRI scan, for computation of SUVR-1 and R<sub>1</sub> images for a scan duration matching the optimal timing. TE was reached first in putamen, frontal- and parietal cortex at 22 ± 4 min for AD patients and in putamen at 20 ± 0 min in controls. Over all regions and subjects, SUVR<sub>20-40</sub>-1 correlated best with DVR-1, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97.

We developed a coma model in the rat mimicking human brainstem coma, which allowed multimodal analysis of a brainstem tegmentum lesion's effects on behavior, cortical electrophysiology, and global brain functional connectivity. After coma induction, we observed a transient period (∼1h) of unresponsiveness accompanied by cortical burst-suppression. Comatose rats then gradually regained behavioral responsiveness concurrent with emergence of delta/theta-predominant cortical rhythms in primary somatosensory cortex. During the acute stage of coma recovery (∼1-8h), longitudinal resting-state functional MRI revealed an increase in functional connectivity between subcortical arousal nuclei in the thalamus, basal forebrain, and basal ganglia and cortical regions implicated in awareness. This rat coma model provides an experimental platform to systematically study network-based mechanisms of coma pathogenesis and recovery, as well as to test targeted therapies aimed at promoting recovery of consciousness after coma."

We speculate that a common brain pathway is involved in these two behaviors. Hippocampus seems to control the signals coming from the external environment, while the amygdale and the hypothalamus control the response to social stimuli. Stimulation of amygdala increase sexual performace, while it triggers violent emotional responses. Stimulation of the hypothalamus causes reactions of violent anger and increases sexual activity. Catecholaminergic stimulation of the amygdala and hypothalamus increases emotional and sexual behavior, while serotonin plays an inhibitory role. Cholinergic inhibition suppress copulatory activity, while the animal becomes hyperemotive. Opioids, as β-endorphin and met-enkephalin, reduce copulatory activity and induce impotence. Gonadal steroid hormones, as estrogen in female and testosterone in male, play a major role in the control of sexual behavior. In addition, also non-ovarian hormones, as adrenal steroids, control sexual behavior, because adrenalectomy induces profound decrease in sexual activity in human and primate females, while androstenedione, as replacement therapy, is able to restore sexual receptivity in female. The neuropeptide kisspeptin and its receptors, located in the limbic structures, mediate olfactory control of the gonadotropic axis showing therapeutic action on psychosexual and reproductive disorders."

30706305,geriatrics,"Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may benefit from deep brain stimulation (DBS) to improve motor and medication-induced symptoms. Yet mixed evidence regarding the outcome of successful DBS on couple satisfaction has been highlighted in the literature. Thirty patients diagnosed with PD were included in a study investigating couple satisfaction (MSS-14), depression (HAD-D) and anxiety (HAD-A) at four measurement times: before DBS and 6, 12, and 18 months post-surgically. Sixteen spouses/partners were included as well. Couple satisfaction from the patient perspective was never associated with depression or anxiety. However, poor marital adjustment (i.e., difference and absolute difference between patients and spouses/partners MSS-14 scores) predicted patients' pre-operative depressive mood. Longitudinal analyses showed that couple satisfaction (n = 9) worsened at 12 months and 18 months compared to pre-DBS scores, F(2.047, 16.378) = 8.723, p = .003, and despite concomitant motor improvement. Growth curve analyses showed that couple satisfaction worsening occurred between 6 and 12 months post-operatively (b = 2.938, p < .001). Thus, couple satisfaction did not increase along with motor improvement and deteriorated after the adjustment period following DBS."

30705794,geriatrics,"Introduction Elderly patients, particularly those in long-term care (LTC), are a growing proportion of patients who present to the emergency department (ED). This population is medically complex, with high burdens on ED resources and patient flow. This study sought to characterize how elderly LTC and community-dwelling (CD) patients use ED services.  Materials and methods This was a retrospective cohort study that assessed approximately 200 senior (age>65) ED visits. These patients were either residing in LTC facilities or they were CD. All participants lived in the same, medium-sized Canadian city. Data indicating demographic information, acuity of presentation, and administrative parameters (such as disposition status or length of stay) were collected and analyzed. Results A few statistically significant differences between the populations were noted. This included mean age, which was 82.6 years in the LTC population and 77.3 for the CD group (p<0.001). There were 27 repeat visits among patients in the LTC group, compared to six from the CD patients (p<0.001). In the LTC population, 75 patients required transport from emergency medical services (EMS) compared to 41 from the control group (p<0.001). Conclusion LTC patients re-present to the ED and use EMS services more frequently than their CD counterparts. This difference indicates potential areas to target for future quality improvement work to help enhance care to this vulnerable population."
30705767,geriatrics,"There is a growing number of elderly kidney transplant (Ktx) recipients. Elderly recipients present lower acute rejection rates but higher incidence of infection and malignancies. Aging <i>per se</i> seems to result in a shift to memory profile and chronic kidney disease (CKD) in premature immunological aging. Understanding aging and CKD effects on the immune system can improve elderly Ktx immunosuppression. We analyzed the effects of aging and CKD in the immune system, comparing healthy adults (HAd) (n=14, 26±2y), healthy elderly (HEld) (n=15, 79±7y), end stage renal disease (ESRD) adults (EnAd) (n=18, 36±7y) and ESRD elderly (EnEld) (n=31, 65±3y) prior to Ktx regarding their naïve, memory and regulatory T and B peripheral lymphocytes. Aging and ESRD presented additive effect decreasing absolute numbers of B and T-lymphocytes, affecting memory, naive and regulatory subsets without synergic effect. Both resulted in higher percentages of T memory subsets and opposing effects on regulatory T (TREG) subsets, higher percentage in aging and lower in ESRD. Combined effect of aging and ESRD also resulted in higher regulatory B cell percentages. In addition to global lymphopenia and TCD4<sup>+</sup> memory shift in both aging and ESRD, aging shifts to an immunoregulatory profile, inducing a increase in TREG percentages, contrasting with ESRD that decreases TREGs. Differential immunosuppression regimens for elderly Ktx may be required. (ClinicalTrials.gov number: NTC01631058)."

Frequencies and AD-associated effects of variants differ across ethnicities. To start filling the gap on AD genetics in South America and assess the impact of these variants across ethnicity, we studied these variants in Argentinian population in association with ancestry. TREM2 (rs143332484 and rs75932628), PLCG2 (rs72824905), and ABI3 (rs616338) were genotyped in 419 AD cases and 486 controls. Meta-analysis with European population was performed. Ancestry was estimated from genome-wide genotyping results. All variants show similar frequencies and odds ratios to those previously reported. Their association with AD reach statistical significance by meta-analysis. Although the Argentinian population is an admixture, variant carriers presented mainly Caucasian ancestry. Rare coding variants in TREM2, PLCG2, and ABI3 also modulate susceptibility to AD in populations from Argentina, and they may have a European heritage."

30704365,geriatrics,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has many long-term consequences including impairment in memory and changes in mood. GSK-3β in its phosphorylated form (p-GSK-3β) is considered to be a major contributor to memory problems that occur with TBI. We have developed an antisense which targets the GSK-3β (GAO) gene. Using a model of closed head concussive TBI, we subjected mice to TBI and injected GAO or a random antisense (RAO) 15 minutes post-injury. One week post-injury mice were tested in object recognition with 24 hour delay. At 4 weeks post injury mice were tested in T-maze foot shock avoidance memory test and a second object recognition test with 24 hour delay using different objects. Mice which received GAO show improved memory in both object recognition and T-maze compared to RAO treated mice that were subjected to TBI. Next, we verified that GAO blocked the surge in phosphorylated GSK-3β post-TBI. Mice were subjected to TBI and injected with antisense 15 minutes post-TBI with GAO or RAO. Mice were sacrificed at 4 and 72 hours post-TBI. Analysis of p-ser9GSK-3β, p-tyr216GSK-3β and p-Tau404 showed that mice which received a TBI+RAO had significantly higher p-ser9GSK-3β, p-tyr216GSK-3β and p-Tau404 levels than the mice which received TBI+GAO and the Sham+RAO mice. The current finding suggests that inhibiting GSK-3β increase after TBI with an antisense directed at GSK-3β prevents the learning and memory impairments."

30703432,geriatrics,"The chemokine receptor CXCR2 and its ligands are implicated in the progression of tumours and various inflammatory diseases. Activation of the CXCLs/CXCR2 axis activates multiple signalling pathways, including the PI3K, p38/ERK, and JAK pathways, and regulates cell survival and migration. The CXCLs/CXCR2 axis plays a vital role in the tumour microenvironment and in recruiting neutrophils to inflammatory sites. Extensive infiltration of neutrophils during chronic inflammation is one of the most important pathogenic factors in various inflammatory diseases. Chronic inflammation is considered to be closely correlated with initiation of cancer. In addition, immunosuppressive effects of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) against T cells attenuate the anti-tumour effects of T cells and promote tumour invasion and metastasis. Over the last several decades, many therapeutic strategies targeting CXCR2 have shown promising results and entered clinical trials. In this review, we focus on the features and functions of the CXCLs/CXCR2 axis and highlight its role in cancer and inflammatory diseases. We also discuss its potential use in targeted therapies."

However, the relationship between the gut microbial population and dementia has not yet been fully clarified. We recruited outpatients visiting our memory clinic to participate in this study. Information on patient demographics, risk factors, and activities of daily living was collected, and cognitive function was assessed using neuropsychological tests and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans. Faecal samples were obtained, and the gut microbiome was assessed by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis, one of the most well-established and reliable 16S ribosomal RNA-based methods for classifying gut microbiota. Patients were divided into two groups, demented and non-demented. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to identify the variables independently associated with dementia. The T-RFLP analysis revealed differences in the composition of the gut microbiome: the number of Bacteroides (enterotype I) was lower and the number of 'other' bacteria (enterotype III) was higher in demented than non-demented patients. Multivariable analyses showed that the populations of enterotype I and enterotype III bacteria were strongly associated with dementia, independent of the traditional dementia biomarkers. Further studies of the metabolites of gut microbes are needed to determine the mechanism underlying this association."

30699170,geriatrics,"Walking aids are widely used by older adults, however, alarmingly, their use has been linked to increased falls-risk, yet clinicians have no objective way of assessing user stability. This work aims to demonstrate the application of a novel methodology to investigate how the type of walking task, the amount of body weight supported by the device (i.e., device loading), and task performance strategy affect stability of rollator users. In this context, ten users performed six walking tasks with an instrumented rollator. The combined stability margin ""SM"" was calculated, which considers user and rollator as a combined system. A Friedman Test was used to investigate the effects of task on SM and a least-squares regression model was applied to investigate the relationship between device loading and SM. In addition, the effects of task performance strategy on SM were explored. As a result, it was found that: the minimum SM for straight line walking was higher than for more complex tasks (p<0.05); an increase in device loading was associated with an increase in SM (p<0.05); stepping up a kerb with at least 1 rollator wheel in ground contact at all times resulted in higher SM than lifting all four wheels simultaneously. Hence, we conclude that training should not be limited to straight line walking but should include various everyday tasks. Within person, SM informs on which tasks need practicing, and which strategy facilitates stability, thereby enabling person-specific guidance/training. The relevance of this work lies in an increase in walking aid users, and the costs arising from fall-related injuries."

We therefore incorporated gene-alcohol interactions into a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We included 45 studies in Stage 1 (genome-wide discovery) and 66 studies in Stage 2 (focused follow-up), for a total of 394,584 individuals from five ancestry groups. Genetic main and interaction effects were jointly assessed by a 2 degrees of freedom (DF) test, and a 1 DF test was used to assess the interaction effects alone. Variants at 495 loci were at least suggestively associated (P < 1 × 10-6) with lipid levels in Stage 1 and were evaluated in Stage 2, followed by combined analyses of Stage 1 and Stage 2. In the combined analysis of Stage 1 and Stage 2, 147 independent loci were associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10-8 using 2 DF tests, of which 18 were novel. No genome-wide significant associations were found testing the interaction effect alone.

30697698,geriatrics,"Older adults are prescribed a growing number of medications. Polypharmacy, commonly considered the receipt of five or more medications, is associated with a range of adverse outcomes. There is a debate about the reason(s) why. On one side is the assertion that older persons are being prescribed too many medications, with the number of medications increasing the risk of adverse events. On the other side is the observation that polypharmacy is associated both with overprescribing of inappropriate medications and underprescribing of appropriate medications. This leads to the concept of ""inappropriate"" vs ""appropriate"" polypharmacy, with the latter resulting from the prescription of many correct medications to persons with multiple chronic conditions. Few studies have examined the health outcomes associated with adding and/or removing medications to address this debate directly. The criteria used to identify underutilized medications are based on results of randomized controlled trials that may not be generalizable to older adults. Several randomized controlled trials and many more observational studies provide evidence that these criteria overestimate medication benefits and underestimate harms. In addition, evidence suggests that the marginal effects of medications added to an already complex regimen differ from their effects when considered individually. Although in selected circumstances adding medications results in benefit to patients, patients with multimorbidity and frailty/disability have susceptibilities that can decrease the likelihood of medication benefit and increase the likelihood of harms. The identification of appropriate polypharmacy requires more robust criteria to evaluate the net effects of complex medication regimens."

We previously found that chronic consumption of ethanol was associated with increased levels of RNA editing of serotonin 2C receptor in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, it remains unknown whether RNA editing in the NAc modulates alcohol addiction through the brain reward system. To investigate the involvement of NAc RNA editing in alcohol addiction, we generated NAc-specific knockout mice of the double-stranded RNA-specific adenosine deaminase <i>ADAR2</i> using AAV-GFP/Cre and conducted a battery of behavioral tests including anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. In addition, NAc-specific <i>ADAR2</i> knockout mice were exposed to ethanol vapor for 20 days, followed by ethanol-drinking and conditioned place preference (CPP) tests. NAc-specific <i>ADAR2</i> knockout mice showed a significant decrease in locomotor activity in the open field test although they did not develop anxiety- and depression-like behaviors. In addition, the enhancements of ethanol intake and ethanol preference that are usually observed after chronic ethanol vapor exposure were significantly reduced in these mice. These results suggest that ADAR2-mediated RNA editing in the NAc is involved in determination of alcohol preference after chronic alcohol consumption."

30696869,geriatrics,"Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer's dementia and cognitive decline. The cause of neurodegeneration in chronic diabetic patients remains unclear. Changes in brain microglial activity due to glycemic fluctuations may be an etiological factor. Here, we examined the impact of acute ambient glucose fluctuations on BV-2 microglial activity. Biochemical parameters were assayed and showed that the shift from normal glucose (NG; 5.5 mM) to high glucose (HG; 25 mM) promoted cell growth and induced oxidative/inflammatory stress and microglial activation, as evidenced by increased MTT reduction, elevated pro-inflammatory factor secretion (i.e., TNF-α and oxygen free radicals), and upregulated expression of stress/inflammatory proteins (i.e., HSP70, HO-1, iNOS, and COX-2). Also, LPS-induced inflammation was enlarged by an NG-to-HG shift. In contrast, the HG-to-NG shift trapped microglia in a state of metabolic stress, which led to apoptosis and autophagy, as evidenced by decreased Bcl-2 and increased cleaved caspase-3, TUNEL staining, and LC3B-II expression. These stress episodes were primarily mediated through MAPKs, PI3K/Akt, and NF-κB cascades. Our study demonstrates that acute glucose fluctuation forms the stress that alters microglial activity (e.g., inflammatory activation or self-degradation), representing a novel pathogenic mechanism for the continued deterioration of neurological function in diabetic patients."
30696803,geriatrics,"BACKGROUND E74-like factor 5 (ELF5) plays a key role in the processes of cell differentiation, apoptosis, and occurrence of tumors. However, the effect of ELF5 on metastasis and invasion in human ovarian cancer remains poorly understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed to measure the expression of ELF5. The viability of cells was detected by cell counting kit (CCK-8). Cell apoptosis was tested by flow cytometry. Matrigel plug angiogenesis assay was employed to determine angiogenesis rate. The protein expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cleaved caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), E-cadherin, N-cadherin, Snail, phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), phosphorylated (p)-PI3K, tyrosine kinase B (AKT), and phosphorylated (p)-AKT were determined by Western blot. Wound-healing assay and Transwell were used to determine invasion and migration. RESULTS We found that expression of ELF5 was obviously decreased in ovarian cancer cell lines. The cells viability, invasion and metastasis were inhibited by overexpression ELF5. ELF5 suppressed angiogenesis rate and the expression of VEGF. Changes of the expressions of Bcl-2, cleaved caspase-3 and Bax showed that anti-apoptosis ability was improved by ELF5. ELF5 also repressed N-cadherin and Snail and increased E-cadherin. The expressions of p-PI3K and p-AKT were decreased by ELF5. Further study showed that IGF-I reversed the inhibitory effect of ELF5 on growth and metastasis of SKOV3 cells. CONCLUSIONS Overexpression of ELF5 promoted the apoptosis and reduced the migration and invasion of ovarian cancer cells; therefore, it could provide a new approach to gene treatment of ovarian carcinoma."
