30727008,gene therapy,"Osteoarthritis (OA) affects a significant number of the world's adult population. In recent years different causal approaches to treat OA based on new translational knowledge have been developed. This review article provides, a brief overview of new findings on the pathophysiology and genetics and the interplay between biomechanics, pain and body weight. Current pharmacological and reconstructive surgical treatment options as well as studies on novel regenerative and molecular therapies of OA, such as applying NGF, FGF-18, TNF-α, Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors, and TGF-β1 gene therapy are discussed. The basis of this work is a selective literature search in PubMed, ScienceDirect and Google Scholar. Selected new findings are discussed in the clinical perspective of OA."
30726835,gene therapy,"The WHO defined myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms (MLN) with eosinophilia associated with PDGFRB, PDGFRA, FGFR1 rearrangements as a new entity in 2016. PDGFRB-rearranged MLN sensitive to imatinib were described in adult patients. We report the first pediatric patient with PDGFRB-rearranged myeloproliferative disorder associated with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma bearing the t(5; 14)(q33;q32) translocation who was successfully treated with imatinib only. Methods/Aims: Analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization identified the PDGFRB partner as CCDC88C. Whole genome sequencing of the patient's DNA identified the exact junction site, confirmed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing. A real-time quantitative PCR assay was designed to quantify the fused CCDC88C-PDGFRB product."
30726782,gene therapy,"Myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasm (MDS/MPN) with ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis (MDS/MPN with RS-T), which exhibits both an increased number of marrow ring sideroblasts and thrombocytosis, is a rare disorder classified as one of the newly established forms of MDS/MPN in the WHO 2016 classification. A 77-year-old female with marked thrombocytosis of 1,024×10<sup>9</sup>/L was tentatively diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia in 2011, and the thrombocytosis was controlled using hydroxycarbamide and low-dose busulfan. In 2016, the leukocyte count increased to a peak value of 68.8×10<sup>9</sup>/L (86.6% mature neutrophils) during platelet-reduction therapy. Bone marrow aspirate exhibited hypercellularity with ring sideroblasts comprising 41.5% erythroblasts without excess myeloblasts. Cytogenetic examination demonstrated the JAK2 V617F mutation and chromosomal abnormality of 46,XX,del(20)(q1?). Furthermore, dysplastic features of erythroid and granuloid precursors, as well as many large atypical megakaryocytes, were observed. Further genetic examinations revealed the SF3B1 K700E mutation, but not amplification of the JAK2 gene or pathogenic mutations in the 13 other genes examined. A diagnosis of MDS/MPN with RS-T was established and hyperleukocytosis was controlled using a higher dose of hydroxycarbamide. Although the patient maintained a stable disease state, she became RBC transfusion-dependent. Hyperleukocytosis, regardless of chemotherapy, is rare and may be novel in this disorder."
30726709,gene therapy,"The canonical effect of Pregnane X Receptor (PXR, NR1I2) agonism includes enhanced hepatic uptake and a concomitant increase in the first-pass metabolism and efflux of drugs in mammalian liver and intestine. In patients undergoing combination therapy, PXR-mediated gene regulation represents the molecular basis of numerous food-drug, herb-drug, and drug-drug interactions. Moreover, PXR activation promotes chemotherapeutic resistance in certain malignancies. Additional research efforts suggest that sustained PXR activation exacerbates the development of fatty liver disease. Additional metabolic effects of PXR activation in liver are the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis. The identification of non-toxic and selective PXR antagonists is therefore of current research interest. Inhibition of PXR should decrease adverse effects, improve therapeutic effectiveness, and advance clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, fatty liver, and diabetes. This review identifies small molecule PXR antagonists described to date, discusses possible molecular mechanisms of inhibition, and seeks to describe the likely biomedical consequences of the inhibition of this nuclear receptor superfamily member."

30726206,gene therapy,"During CNS development, the nuclear protein SATB2 is expressed in superficial cortical layers and determines projection neuron identity. In the adult CNS, SATB2 is expressed in pyramidal neurons of all cortical layers and is a regulator of synaptic plasticity and long-term memory. Common variation in SATB2 locus confers risk of schizophrenia, whereas rare, de novo structural and single nucleotide variants cause severe intellectual disability and absent or limited speech. To characterize differences in SATB2 molecular function in developing vs adult neocortex, we isolated SATB2 protein interactomes at the two ontogenetic stages and identified multiple novel SATB2 interactors. SATB2 interactomes are highly enriched for proteins that stabilize de novo chromatin loops. The comparison between the neonatal and adult SATB2 protein complexes indicates a developmental shift in SATB2 molecular function, from transcriptional repression towards organization of chromosomal superstructure. Accordingly, gene sets regulated by SATB2 in the neocortex of neonatal and adult mice show limited overlap. Genes encoding SATB2 protein interactors were grouped for gene set analysis of human GWAS data. Common variants associated with human cognitive ability are enriched within the genes encoding adult but not neonatal SATB2 interactors. Our data support a shift in the function of SATB2 in cortex over lifetime and indicate that regulation of spatial chromatin architecture by the SATB2 interactome contributes to cognitive function in the general population."
30725455,gene therapy,"Acetylation is a highly abundant and dynamic post-translational modification (PTM) on histone proteins which, when present on chromatin-bound histones, facilitates the accessibility of DNA for gene transcription. The central metabolite, acetyl-CoA, is a substrate for acetyltransferases, which catalyze protein acetylation. Acetyl-CoA is an essential intermediate in diverse metabolic pathways, and cellular acetyl-CoA levels fluctuate according to extracellular nutrient availability and the metabolic state of the cell. The Michaelis constant (Km) of most histone acetyltransferases (HATs), which specifically target histone proteins, falls within the range of cellular acetyl-CoA concentrations. As a consequence, global levels of histone acetylation are often restricted by availability of acetyl-CoA. Such metabolic regulation of histone acetylation is important for cell proliferation, differentiation, and a variety of cellular functions. In cancer, numerous oncogenic signaling events hijack cellular metabolism, ultimately inducing an extensive rearrangement of the epigenetic state of the cell. Understanding metabolic control of the epigenome through histone acetylation is essential to illuminate the molecular mechanisms by which cells sense, adapt, and occasionally disengage nutrient fluctuations and environmental cues from gene expression. In particular, targeting metabolic regulators or even dietary interventions to impact acetyl-CoA availability and histone acetylation is a promising target in cancer therapy. Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the most accurate methodology to quantify protein PTMs and metabolites. In this chapter, we present state-of-the-art protocols to analyze histone acetylation and acetyl-CoA. Histones are extracted and digested into short peptides (4-20 aa) prior to LC-MS. Acetyl-CoA is extracted from cells and analyzed using an analogous mass spectrometry-based procedure. Model systems can be fed with isotopically labeled substrates to investigate the metabolic preference for acetyl-CoA production and the metabolic dependence and turnover of histone acetylation. We also present an example of data integration to correlate changes in acetyl-CoA production with histone acetylation."
30725416,gene therapy,"Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) derived from Pseudomonas putida targets the elevated methionine (MET) requirement of cancer cells (methionine dependence) and has shown efficacy against a variety of cancer types in mouse models. To enhance the efficacy of rMETase, we constructed the pLGFP-METSN retrovirus encoding the P. putida methioninase (METase) gene fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. pLGFP-METSN or control vector pLGFPSN was introduced into the human lung cancer cell line H460. The retrovirus-mediated METase gene transfer decreased the intracellular MET level of the cancer cells and consequently enhanced the efficacy of treatment with the rMETase protein. The rMETase gene was introduced into an adenovirus. rAd-METase transduction of human OVACAR-8 ovarian cancer cells and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells in vitro and in vivo resulted in high levels of METase expression up to 10% or more of the total protein of the cells, depending on the multiplicity of infection. The combination of rAd-METase and rMETase was synergistic to kill these cells. Normal fibroblasts, on the other hand, appeared relatively resistant to the METase gene in the presence of rMETase. Adenoviral METase-transduced cancer cells were used in combination with selenomethionine, releasing highly toxic methylselenol, which killed both the cancer cells containing the METase gene and bystanders. Methylselenol damaged the mitochondria via oxidative stress and caused cytochrome c release into the cytosol, thereby activating the caspase cascade and cancer-cell apoptosis. Adenoviral METase-gene/SeMET treatment also inhibited tumor growth in rodents and significantly prolonged their survival. AdMETase/SeMET therapy was effective against Bcl-2-overproducing A549 lung cancer cells, which were resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis, with a strong bystander effect. The combination of Ad-METase/SeMET and doxorubicin (DOX) delayed the growth of the H460 human lung cancer, growing subcutaneously in nude mice. These results demonstrate the potential of methionine restriction (MR) for cancer treatment."
30725167,gene therapy,"Osteoporosis long-term treatment with nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, has been associated with uncommon adverse effects, as atypical femoral fractures (AFF). Thus, treatment with teriparatide (TPTD; fragment of human parathyroid hormone; PTH<sub>1-34</sub>) has been proposed for such patients. Besides its anabolizing effect on bone, TPTD may affect stem-cell mobilization and expansion. Bone marrow mononuclear cells (BMMNC) were isolated from five women that had suffered AFF associated to bisphosphonate treatment, before and after 6 months of TPTD therapy. The presence of mesenchymal stromal cells (CD73, CD90 and CD105 positive cells), gene expression of NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4, proliferation, senescence and capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts and adipocytes were analyzed. After TPTD treatment, BMMNC positive cells for CD73, CD90 and CD105 increased from 6.5 to 37.5% (p < 0.05); NANOG, SOX2 and OCT4 were upregulated, being statistically significant for NANOG (p < 0.05), and cells increased proliferative capacity more than 50% at day 7 (p < 0.05). Senescence was reduced 2.5-fold (p < 0.05), increasing differentiation capacity into osteoblasts and adipocytes, with more than twice mineralization capacity of extracellular matrix or fat-droplet formation (p < 0.05), respectively. Results show that TPTD treatment caused BMMNC ""rejuvenation"", increasing the number of cells in a more undifferentiated stage, with higher differentiation potency. This effect may favor TPTD anabolic action on bone in such patients with AFF, increasing osteoblast precursor cells. Such response could also arise in other osteoporotic patients treated with TPTD, without previous AFF. Furthermore, our data suggest that TPTD effect on stromal cells may have clinical implications for bone-regenerative medicine. Further studies may deepen on this potential."

30724424,gene therapy,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate different protocols of enzymatic treatment (collagenase with either protease, trypsin or hyaluronidase) to isolate mature odontoblasts. Primary odontoblasts were obtained from human molars, which was confirmed by histology and scanning electron microscopy. The combination of collagenase with protease appeared most suitable and resulted in higher cell numbers and better integrity of the odontoblast processes, whereas combination with hyaluronidase or trypsin led to truncated processes and detachment of cell patches instead of single cells. However, trypan blue staining after 24 h showed that odontoblasts in culture did not remain viable. Gene expression analysis was possible after mRNA extraction from tissues ex vivo and real-time semi-quantitative PCR revealed increased expression of collagen, nestin, bone sialoprotein and dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein 1 in the odontoblast layer. Though primary odontoblasts could not be cultivated after isolation, characteristic genes were identified to differentiate odontoblasts from pulp fibroblasts."
30724386,gene therapy,"The urea cycle and glutamine synthetase (GS) are the two main pathways for waste nitrogen removal and their deficiency results in hyperammonemia. Here, we investigated the efficacy of liver-specific GS overexpression for therapy of hyperammonemia. To achieve hepatic GS overexpression, we generated a helper-dependent adenoviral (HDAd) vector expressing the murine GS under the control of a liver-specific expression cassette (HDAd-GS). Compared to mice injected with a control vector expressing an unrelated reporter gene (HDAd-AFP), wild-type mice with increased hepatic GS showed reduced blood ammonia levels and a concomitant increase of blood glutamine after intraperitoneal injections of ammonium chloride, whereas blood urea was unaffected. Moreover, injection of HDAd-GS reduced blood ammonia levels at baseline and protected against acute hyperammonemia following ammonia challenge in a mouse model with conditional hepatic deficiency of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase 1 (Cps1), the initial and rate-limiting step of ureagenesis. In summary, we found that upregulation of hepatic GS reduced hyperammonemia in wild-type and Cps1-deficient mice, thus confirming a key role of GS in ammonia detoxification. These results suggest that hepatic GS augmentation therapy has potential for treatment of both primary and secondary forms of hyperammonemia. This article is protected by copyright.

30724158,gene therapy,"IFN-γ is a pleiotropic cytokine crucial for both innate and adaptive immunity, which also plays a critical role in immunological surveillance of cancer. Genetic defects or gene silencing in the IFN-γ signal transduction pathways as well as in the expression of IFN-γ-regulated genes represent frequent mechanisms by which tumour cells can escape from immune responses. Epigenetic control of the IFN-γ signalling pathway activation associated with epigenetic changes in the corresponding regulatory gene regions, such as chromatin remodelling, histone acetylation and methylation, and DNA demethylation is frequently dysregulated in tumour cells. Epigenetic silencing of the IFN-γ regulatory pathway components, as well as of the IFN-γ-regulated genes crucial for tumour cell recognition or induction of anti-tumour immune responses, has been documented in various cancer models. Expression of both IFN-γ signalling pathway components and selected IFN-γ-regulated genes can be influenced by epigenetic modifiers, namely DNA methyltransferase and histone deacetylase inhibitors. These agents thus can mimic, restore, or boost the immunomodulatory effects of IFN-γ in tumour cells, which can contribute to their anti-tumour therapeutic efficacies and justifies their potential use in combined epigenetic therapy with immunotherapeutic approaches."
30724107,gene therapy,"The glomerular basement membrane (GBM) is a critical component of the kidney's blood filtration barrier. Alport syndrome, a hereditary disease leading to kidney failure, is caused by the loss or dysfunction of the GBM's major type IV collagen (COL4) isoform, α3α4α5. The constituent COL4 achains assemble into heterotrimers in the endoplasmic reticulum prior to secretion into the extracellular space. If any one of the α3, α4, or α5 chains is lost due to mutation of one of the genes, then the entire heterotrimer is lost. Alport patients typically have mutations in the X-linked COL4A5 gene or uncommonly have the autosomal recessive form of the disease due to COL4A3 or COL4A4 mutations. The treatment for Alport syndrome is currently limited to angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition or angiotensin receptor blockers. Experimental approaches in Alport mice demonstrate that induced expression of COL4A3, either widely or specifically in podocytes of Col4a3-/- mice, can abrogate disease progression even after establishment of the abnormal GBM. While targeting podocytes in vivo for gene therapy is a significant challenge, the more accessible glomerular endothelium could be amenable for mutant gene repair. Herein we expressed COL4A3 in Col4a3-/- Alport mice using an endothelial cell-specific inducible transgenic system, but collagen α3α4α5(IV) was not detected in the GBM or elsewhere, and the Alport phenotype was not rescued. Our results suggest that endothelial cells do not express the Col4a3/a4/a5 genes and should not be viewed as a target for gene therapy."

30723786,gene therapy,"Autoimmune diseases are conditions caused by an over reactive immune system that attacks self-tissues and organs. Although the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease is complex and multi-factorial, inflammation is commonly involved. Therefore, anti-inflammatory therapies hold potential for the treatment of autoimmune diseases. However, long-term control of inflammation is challenging and most of the currently used drugs have side effects. Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) is an anti-inflammatory protein with a well-known safety profile. The therapeutic potential of AAT has been tested in several autoimmune disease models. The first study using a recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vector showed that AAT gene transfer prevented the development of type 1 diabetes (T1D) in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model. Subsequent studies showed that treatment with AAT protein prevented and reversed type 1 diabetes. The beneficial effects of AAT treatment have also been observed in other autoimmune disease models such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. This paper reviews the therapeutic application of AAT and discusses possible mechanisms of action in various autoimmune diseases."
30723784,gene therapy,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is a genetic disorder which most commonly manifests as pulmonary emphysema. Accordingly, alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) augmentation therapy aims to reduce the progression of emphysema, as achieved by life-long weekly slow-drip infusions of plasma-derived affinity-purified human AAT. However, not all AATD patients will receive this therapy, due to either lack of medical coverage or low patient compliance. To circumvent these limitations, attempts are being made to develop lung-directed therapies, including inhaled AAT and locally-delivered AAT gene therapy. Lung transplantation is also an ultimate therapy option. Although less common, AATD patients also present with disease manifestations that extend beyond the lung, including vasculitis, diabetes and panniculitis, and appear to experience longer and more frequent hospitalization times and more frequent pneumonia bouts. In the past decade, new mechanism-based clinical indications for AAT therapy have surfaced, depicting a safe, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and tissue-protective agent. Introduced to non-AATD individuals, AAT appears to provide relief from steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease, from bacterial infections in cystic fibrosis and from autoimmune diabetes; preclinical studies show benefit also in multiple sclerosis, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, acute myocardial infarction and stroke, as well as ischemia-reperfusion injury and aberrant wound healing processes. While the current augmentation therapy is targeted towards treatment of emphysema, it is suggested that AATD patients may benefit from AAT augmentation therapy geared towards extrapulmonary pathologies as well. Thus, development of mechanism-based, context-specific AAT augmentation therapy protocols is encouraged. In the current review, we will discuss extrapulmonary manifestations of AATD and the potential of AAT augmentation therapy for these conditions."
30723782,gene therapy,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) manifests primarily as early-onset emphysema caused by the destruction of the lung by neutrophil elastase due to low amounts of the serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). The current therapy involves weekly intravenous infusions of AAT-derived from pooled human plasma that is efficacious, yet costly. Gene therapy applications designed to provide constant levels of the AAT protein are currently under development. The challenge is for gene therapy to provide sufficient amounts of AAT to normalize the inhibitor level and anti-neutrophil elastase capacity in the lung. One strategy involves administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vector to the pleural space providing both local and systemic production of AAT to reach consistent therapeutic levels. This review focuses on the strategy, advantages, challenges, and updates for intrapleural administration of gene therapy vectors for the treatment of AATD."
30723781,gene therapy,"Alpha-1antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) results from the intracellular polymerization and retention of mutant alpha-1antitrypsin (AAT) within the endoplasmic reticulum of hepatocytes. This causes cirrhosis whilst the deficiency of circulating AAT predisposes to early onset emphysema. This is an exciting time for researchers in the field with the development of novel therapies based on understanding the pathobiology of disease. I review here augmentation therapy to prevent the progression of lung disease and a range of approaches to treat the liver disease associated with the accumulation of mutant AAT: modifying proteostasis networks that are activated by Z AAT polymers, stimulating autophagy, small interfering RNA and small molecules to block intracellular polymerization, and stem cell technology to correct the genetic defect that underlies AATD."
30723666,gene therapy,"A 47-year-old man was referred to our hospital with a 1-month history of fever and dyspnea after inhalation of insecticide in a confined space. We diagnosed rapidly progressive interstitial pneumonia. High-dose methylprednisolone, tacrolimus, and intermittent infusion of cyclophosphamide were administered. His condition rapidly deteriorated; therefore, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was performed. Unfortunately, he died 69 days after admission. Although typical skin findings suggestive of dermatomyositis were absent, anti-melanoma differentiation-associate gene (anti-MDA5) antibody was positive. Our findings suggest that in patients with hyperferritinemia and rapidly progressive interstitial lung disease (RP-ILD) demonstrating random ground glass shadows and peripheral consolidations by high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) even if skin manifestations related to dermatomyositis are not complicated, we should assume anti-MDA5 antibody-positive interstitial pneumonia."
30723592,gene therapy,"This study aimed to establish the number of expression-based molecular subclasses in cutaneous melanoma, identify their dominant biological pathways and evaluate their clinical relevance. To this end, consensus clustering was performed separately on two independent datasets (n = 405 and n = 473) composed of publicly available cutaneous melanoma expression profiles from previous studies. Four expression-based molecular subclasses were identified and labelled 'Oxidative phosphorylation', 'Oestrogen response/p53-pathway', 'Immune' and 'Cell cycle', based on their dominantly expressed biological pathways determined by gene set enrichment analysis. Multivariate survival analysis revealed shorter overall survival in the 'Oxidative phosphorylation' subclass compared to the other subclasses. This was validated in a third independent dataset (n = 214). Finally, in a pooled cohort of 76 patients treated with anti-PD-1 therapy a trend towards a difference in response rates between subclasses was observed ('Immune' subclass: 65% responders, 'Oxidative Phosphorylation' subclass: 60% responders, other subclasses: <50% responders). These findings support the stratification of cutaneous melanoma in four expression-based molecular subclasses."
30723448,gene therapy,"The term hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP) embraces a clinically and genetically heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative diseases characterized by progressive spasticity and weakness of the lower limbs. There currently exist no specific therapies for HSP, and treatment is exclusively symptomatic, aimed at reducing muscle spasticity, and improving strength and gait. The authors set out to perform a comprehensive systematic review of the available scientific literature on the treatment of HSP, applying Cochrane Collaboration methods. The Google Scholar, PubMed and Scopus electronic databases were searched to find relevant randomized control trials (RCTs) and open-label interventional studies, prospective, and retrospective observational studies of supplements, medications, and physical therapy, as well as case reports and case series. Two authors independently analyzed 27 articles selected on the basis of a series of inclusion criteria. Applying a best-evidence synthesis approach, they evaluated these articles for methodological quality. A standardized scoring system was used to obtain interrater assessments. Disagreements were resolved by discussion. The 27 articles focused on pharmacological treatment (<i>n</i> = 17 articles), physical therapy (<i>n</i> = 5), surgical treatment (<i>n</i> = 5). The drugs used in the 17 articles on pharmacological therapy were: gabapentin, progabide, dalfampridine, botulinum toxin, L-Dopa, cholesterol-lowering drugs, betaine, and folinic acid. Gabapentin, progabide, dalfampridine, and botulinum toxin were used as antispastic agents; the study evaluating gabapentin efficacy was well-designed, but failed to demonstrate any significant improvement. L-Dopa, cholesterol-lowering drugs, betaine, and folinic acid were only used in specific HSP subtypes. Two of the three studies evaluating cholesterol-lowering drugs (in SPG5 patients) were well-designed and showed a significant reduction of specific serum biomarkers (oxysterols), but clinical outcomes were not evaluated. The articles focusing on physical treatment and surgical therapy were found to be of low/medium quality and, accordingly, failed to clarify the role of these approaches in HSP. Despite recent advances in understanding of the pathogenesis of HSP and the possibility, in several centers, of obtaining more precise and rapid molecular diagnoses, there is still no adequate evidence base for recommending the various published therapies. Well-designed RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy of both symptomatic and pathogenetic treatments."
30723317,gene therapy,"Wilson disease (WD) is an autosomal recessive disease of copper excess due to pathogenic variants in the ATP7B gene coding for a copper-transporting ATPase. We present a 5-year-old girl with the homozygous frame shift variant NM_000053.3: c.19_20del in exon 1 of ATP7B (consecutive exon numbering with c.1 as first nucleotide of exon 1), detected by whole-exome sequencing as a secondary finding. The variant leads to a premature termination codon in exon 2. The girl exhibited no WD symptoms and no abnormalities in liver biopsy. ATP7B liver mRNA expression was comparable to healthy controls suggesting that nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) could be bypassed by the mechanism of translation reinitiation. To verify this hypothesis, a CMV-driven ATP7B minigene (pcDNA3) was equipped with the authentic ATP7B 5' untranslated region  and a truncated intron 2. We introduced c.19_20del by site-directed mutagenesis and overexpressed the constructs in HEK293T cells. We analyzed ATP7B expression by qRT-PCR, northern and western blot, and examined protein function by copper export capacity assays. Northern blot, qRT-PCR, and western blot revealed that c.19_20del ATP7B mRNA and protein is expressed in size and amount comparable to wild-type. Copper export capacity was also comparable to wild-type. Our results indicate that c.19_20del in ATP7B is able to bypass NMD by translation reinitiation, demonstrating that the classification of truncating variants as pathogenic without additional investigations should be done carefully."
30723315,gene therapy,"Vincristine is an important drug of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment protocols that can cause neurotoxicity. Patients treated with LAL/SHOP protocols often suffer from vincristine-related neurotoxicity in early phases of treatment. A genetic variant in CEP72, a gene involved in vincristine pharmacodynamics, was recently associated with neurotoxicity after prolonged vincristine treatment. This association was not replicated in our Spanish population during induction phase. To test the possibility that other variants in genes involved in vincristine pharmacodynamics were associated with vincristine neuropathy in early phases of the treatment, we evaluated the correlation with toxicity of 24 polymorphisms in 9 key genes in a large cohort of 152 Spanish children with B-ALL homogeneously treated. Results showed no association between any genetic variant in the TUBB1, TUBB2A, TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBB4, MAPT, MIR146a, MIR202, and MIR411 genes and vincristine-related neurotoxicity. These results are in line with the hypothesis that there are different mechanisms causing pheripheral neurotoxicity after prolonged and short-term vincristine treatments."

30723300,gene therapy,"Poorly differentiated neoplasms lacking characteristic histopathologic features represent a significant challenge to the pathologist for diagnostic classification. Classically, NUT carcinoma (previously NUT midline carcinoma) is poorly differentiated but typically exhibits variable degrees of squamous differentiation. Diagnosis is genetically defined by NUTM1 rearrangement, usually with BRD4 as the fusion partner. In this multi-institutional next-generation sequencing and fluorescence in situ hybridization study, 26 new NUTM1-rearranged neoplasms are reported, including 20 NUT carcinomas, 4 sarcomas, and 2 tumors of an uncertain lineage. NUTM1 fusion partners were available in 24 of 26 cases. BRD4 was the fusion partner in 18/24 (75%) cases, NSD3 in 2/24 cases (8.3%), and BRD3 in 1/24 (4.2%) cases. Two novel fusion partners were identified: MGA in two sarcomas (myxoid spindle cell sarcoma and undifferentiated sarcoma) (2/24 cases 8.3%) and MXD4 in a round cell sarcoma in the cecum (1/24 cases 4.2%). Eleven cases tested for NUT immunoexpression were all positive, including the MGA and MXD4-rearranged tumors. Our results confirm that NUTM1 gene rearrangements are found outside the classic clinicopathological setting of NUT carcinoma. In addition, as novel fusion partners like MGA and MXD4 may not be susceptible to targeted therapy with bromodomain inhibitors, detecting the NUTM1 rearrangement may not be enough, and identifying the specific fusion partner may become necessary. Studies to elucidate the mechanism of tumorigenesis of novel fusion partners are needed."
30723297,gene therapy,"Oncogenic fusions are rare in colorectal carcinomas, but may be important for prognosis and therapy. An effective strategy for screening targetable oncogenic fusions in colorectal carcinomas is needed. Here, we investigate molecular genetic alterations in colorectal carcinomas based on their DNA mismatch repair status, and to effectively screen for targetable oncogenic fusions in colorectal carcinomas. In this retrospective study, the initial cohort included 125 consecutive mismatch repair-deficient and 238 randomly selected mismatch repair-proficient colorectal carcinomas diagnosed between July 2015 and December 2017 at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. Targeted sequencing was performed. MLH1 promoter hypermethylation analysis was further employed for subgrouping dMMR colorectal carcinomas. Clinicopathological characteristics, molecular features, and survival outcome of colorectal carcinomas harboring oncogenic fusions were assessed. A multicenter cohort comprised of 227 colorectal carcinomas with dual loss of MLH1/PMS2 was used to validate the efficacy of the proposed screening strategy for oncogenic fusions. Of the 363 patients in the initial cohort, 11(3.0%) harbored oncogenic fusions and were all mismatch repair-deficient colorectal carcinomas with hypermethylated MLH1 and wild-type BRAF and KRAS, comprising 55% (11/20) of this subgroup. These patients with oncogenic fusions showed poorer 3-year cancer-specific survival compared with other Stage III/IV mismatch repair-deficient colorectal carcinoma patients (40% vs. 97%), and significantly higher CD274(PD-L1) expression in tumor cells compared with other dMMR colorectal carcinoma patients (46% vs. 6.1%, P < 0.001). An easy-to-perform and cost-efficient strategy for screening targetable fusions was proposed based on the current molecular testing algorithms for colorectal carcinomas, and validated in an independent multicenter cohort. In conclusion, oncogenic fusions were highly enriched and frequently detected in mismatch repair-deficient colorectal carcinomas with MLH1 hypermethylation and wild-type BRAF and KRAS, and were associated with poor prognosis and high tumor CD274(PD-L1) expression."
30723213,gene therapy,"Regeneration of human kidneys in animal models would help combat the severe shortage of donors in transplantation therapy. Previously, we demonstrated by interspecific blastocyst complementation between mouse and rats, generation of pluripotent stem cell (PSC)-derived functional pancreas, in apancreatic Pdx1 mutant mice. We, however, were unable to obtain rat PSC-derived kidneys in anephric Sall1 mutant mice, likely due to the poor contribution of rat PSCs to the mouse metanephric mesenchyme, a nephron progenitor. Here, conversely, we show that mouse PSCs can efficiently differentiate into the metanephric mesenchyme in rat, allowing the generation of mouse PSC-derived kidney in anephric Sall1 mutant rat. Glomerular epithelium and renal tubules in the kidneys are entirely composed of mouse PSC-derived cells expressing key functional markers. Importantly, the ureter-bladder junction is normally formed. These data provide proof-of-principle for interspecific blastocyst complementation as a viable approach for kidney generation."

30721651,gene therapy,"Cancer is the second leading cause of mortality worldwide after cardiovascular diseases, predominantly due to the lack of early symptoms and early diagnosis, and high relapse rate after radical surgery and conventional therapies. Therefore, novel approaches such as gene therapy have raised hope to significantly improve the survival rate of patients with cancers. This review aims to provide up-to-date information concerning gene therapy including improved vectors, suicide genes, cancer suppressor genes, anti-tumor angiogenesis, gene silencing, oncolytic virotherapy, and gene-editing technology. Although specific issues still exist before gene therapy can completely cure cancers, here we highlight the potential of gene therapy in cancer treatment and expect to see continuous breakthroughs in techniques and methodologies of gene therapy."
30721421,gene therapy,"Cancer stem cells show epigenetic plasticity and intrinsic resistance to anti-cancer therapy, rendering capable of initiating cancer relapse and progression. Transcription factor OCT-4 regulates various pathways in stem cells, but its expression can be regulated by pseudogenes. This work evaluated how OCT4-PG1 pseudogene can affect OCT-4 expression and mechanisms related to the multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype in FEPS cells. Considering that OCT-4 protein is a transcription factor that regulates expression of ABC transporters, level of gene expression, activity of ABC proteins and cell sensitivity to chemotherapy were evaluated after OCT4-PG1 silencing. Besides we set up a STRING network. Results showed that after OCT4-PG1 silencing, cells expressed OCT-4 gene and protein to a lesser extent than mock cells. The gene and protein expression of ABCB1, as well as its activity were reduced. On the other hand, ALOX5 and ABCC1 genes was increased even as the activity of this transporter. Moreover, the silencing cells become sensitive to two chemotherapics tested. The network structure demonstrated that OCT4-PG1 protein interacts directly with OCT-4, SOX2, and NANOG and indirectly with ABC transporters. We conclude that OCT4-PG1 pseudogene plays a key role in the regulation OCT-4 transcription factor, which alters MDR phenotype in the FEPS cell line."
30721408,gene therapy,"Despite decades of research, accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease remains a challenge, and disease-modifying treatments are still lacking. Research into the early (presymptomatic) stages of Parkinson's disease and the discovery of novel biomarkers is of utmost importance to reduce this burden and to come to a more accurate diagnosis at the very onset of the disease. Many have speculated that non-motor symptoms could provide a breakthrough in the quest for early biomarkers of Parkinson's disease, including the visual disturbances and retinal abnormalities that are seen in the majority of Parkinson's disease patients. An expanding number of clinical studies have investigated the use of in vivo assessments of retinal structure, electrophysiological function, and vision-driven tasks as novel means for identifying patients at risk that need further neurological examination and for longitudinal follow-up of disease progression in Parkinson's disease patients. Often, the results of these studies have been interpreted in relation to α-synuclein deposits and dopamine deficiency in the retina, mirroring the defining pathological features of Parkinson's disease in the brain. To better understand the visual defects seen in Parkinson's disease patients and to propel the use of retinal changes as biomarkers for Parkinson's disease, however, more conclusive neuropathological evidence for the presence of retinal α-synuclein aggregates, and its relation to the cerebral α-synuclein burden, is urgently needed. This review provides a comprehensive and critical overview of the research conducted to unveil α-synuclein aggregates in the retina of Parkinson's disease patients and animal models, and thereby aims to aid the ongoing discussion about the potential use of the retinal changes and/or visual symptoms as biomarkers for Parkinson's disease."
30721154,gene therapy,"While anti-VEGF drugs are commonly used to inhibit pathological retinal and choroidal neovascularization, not all patients respond in an optimal manner. Mechanisms underpinning resistance to anti-VEGF therapy include the upregulation of other pro-angiogenic factors. Therefore, therapeutic strategies that simultaneously target multiple growth factor signalling pathways would have significant value. Here, we show that Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CAMKII) mediates the angiogenic actions of a range of growth factors in human retinal endothelial cells and that this kinase acts as a key nodal point for the activation of several signal transduction cascades that are known to play a critical role in growth factor-induced angiogenesis. We also demonstrate that endothelial CAMKIIγ and δ isoforms differentially regulate the angiogenic effects of different growth factors and that genetic deletion of these isoforms suppresses pathological retinal and choroidal neovascularisation in vivo. Our studies suggest that CAMKII could provide a novel and efficacious target to inhibit multiple angiogenic signalling pathways for the treatment of vasoproliferative diseases of the eye. CAMKIIγ represents a particularly promising target, as deletion of this isoform inhibited pathological neovascularisation, whilst enhancing reparative angiogenesis in the ischemic retina."
30720785,gene therapy,"Fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) is a powerful imaging modality used to gather fluorescent reporter data independent of intracellular reporter intensity or imaging depth. We applied this technique to image real-time activation of a reporter for the proteolytic enzyme, caspase-3, in response to apoptotic cell death. This caspase-3 reporter activity provides valuable insight into cancer cell responsiveness to therapy and overall viability at a single-cell scale. Cleavage of a aspartate-glutamate-valine-aspartate (DEVD) linkage sequence alters Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) within the reporter, affecting its lifetime. Cellular apoptosis was quantified in multiple environments ranging from 2D flat and 3D spheroid cell culture systems to in vivo murine mammary tumor xenografts. We evaluated cell-by-cell apoptotic responses to multiple pharmacological and genetic methods of interest involved in cancer cell death. Within this article, we describe methods for measuring caspase-3 activation at single-cell resolution in various complex environments using FLIM."

30720435,gene therapy,"Lipid metabolic disorders play critical roles in atherogenesis. Traditionally, it has been suggested that reduced high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels might be an important morbidity indicator for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, it has been argued that therapeutically raising HDL levels may reduce atherogenesis in patients with dyslipidemia. However, recent clinical trials to elevate serum HDL levels by pharmacologic approaches failed to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Thus, to investigate the functionality of HDL and to explore the possible clinical relevance as well as to define an effective indicator that can represent HDL function may provide another key and reference to disclose the clinical treatment of dyslipidemia. We analyzed the association between the data of dichlorofluorescein assay (assay the functionality of HDL), the effect of HDL on oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-stimulated endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in vitro, levels of circulating EPCs, and ex vitro EPC colony forming units of each case, we defined the indicator (relative HDL index (RHDL index) = dichlorofluorescein assay result of each subject/dichlorofluorescein assay reading of our young healthy controls) that may represent functionality of HDL. HDL from healthy adults protected oxLDL-treated EPCs by modulating p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and Rho activation and by promoting nitric oxide production. HDL from subject with RHDL index ≧2 also failed to restore the functionality of oxLDL-treated EPCs via cell-signaling pathways in vitro. The RHDL index significantly correlated with patients' circulating EPC number or EPC colony forming units ex vivo. In conclusions, we explored the RHDL index as a score to predict a patient's EPC functions in vivo and ex vitro."
30720262,gene therapy,"In this work, we report a component-minimal spherical nucleic acid (SNA) from monodisperse DNA-polymer conjugates that can load and release nucleic acid therapeutics in a stimuli-responsive manner. We show that this vehicle assembles from only four strands, and conditional release of its antisense therapeutic cargo can be induced upon recognition of specific oligonucleotide triggers via strand displacement. The latter (triggers) may be a microRNA that offers additional synergistic therapy, in addition to the previously shown ability of the SNA to load hydrophobic drugs. The SNA is easy to prepare, has dynamic character, releases its cargo only upon the presence of both triggers, and can survive biological conditions while protecting its cargo. The gene silencing potency of the cargo was tested in live cells and shown to be suppressed when loaded in the SNA, and its activity was restored only upon release with the two triggers. This vehicle has the essential characteristics of versatility, ease of synthesis, low cost, highly responsive behavior, and ability to support combination therapies, making it a promising candidate for cell-selective drug delivery and clinical transition."

30720139,gene therapy,"Rhynchophylline (RP), the primary active ingredient of Uncaria rhynchophylla, has an anti‑hypertensive effect and protects against ischemia‑induced neuronal damage. The present study aimed to examine the roles and mechanisms of RP in myocardial ischemia‑reperfusion (MI/R) injury of rat cardiomyocytes. Cell viability, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and cell apoptosis were examined by a Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. An ELISA was performed to assess the expression of oxidative stress markers. Spectrophotometry was used to detect the degree of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) openness. Western blotting and reverse transcription‑ quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays were used to evaluate the associated protein and mRNA expression, respectively. The present results demonstrated that RP increased the cell viability of MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes, and suppressed the MI/R‑induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. Additionally, RP modulated the Ca2+ and MMP levels in MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, RP decreased the oxidative stress and mPTP level of MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes. It was additionally observed that RP affected the apoptosis‑associated protein expression and regulated the mitochondrial‑associated gene expression in MI/R‑induced cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, RP ameliorated MI/R injury through the modulation of mitochondrial mechanisms. The potential effects of RP on the protection of MI/R‑induced apoptosis of cardiomyocytes suggest that RP may be an effective target for MI/R therapy."
30720120,gene therapy,"Recently, emerging evidence shows that a number of long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) recruit polycomb group (PcG) proteins to specific chromatin loci to silence relevant gene expression. In the present study, we provided evidence that lncRNA candidates, selected by bioinformatic analysis and nervous system polycomb 1 (NSPc1), a key polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) member, were highly expressed in glioma H4 cells in contrast to that noted in non‑cancerous cells. RNA binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays demonstrated that metastasis associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1), SOX2 overlapping transcript (SOX2OT) and maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) among the 8 candidates bound to the NSPc1 protein complex in glioma H4 cells. Furthermore, overexpression of NSPc1 caused a decrease in the expression of MALAT1 and MEG3 and increased expression of SOX2OT, while NSPc1 downregulation caused the levels of all three genes to increase. Meanwhile, suppression of the expression of MALAT1 increased the expression levels of mRNA and protein of NSPc1, whereas downregulation of the expression of SOX2OT decreased NSPc1 expression. Moreover, a significant decrease in cell growth and increased cell apoptosis were observed in the transfected H4 cells by MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis. The results showed that the reduced co‑expression between NSPc1 and MALAT1/SOX2OT decreased the proliferation and promoted the death of H4 cells more obviously than the respectively decrease in expression of NSPc1, MALAT1 and SOX2OT. Remarkably, the influence of a simultaneously decreased expression of NSPc1 and SOX2OT on promoting cell apoptosis was more obvious than the total effect of the separate downregulation of NSPc1 and SOX2OT on accelerating cell death. However, that impact was partially counteracted in the silencing of the co‑expression of MALAT1 and NSPc1. Furthermore, they cooperated to affect transcription of p21 and OCT4.Briefly, these data suggest NSPc1 polycomb protein complex binding and cross‑talk to lncRNAs in glioma H4 cells, offering new insight into the important function of polycomb protein complex and lncRNA interactions in glioma cells and provide a novel view of potential biomarkers and targets for the diagnosis and therapy of glioma."
30720118,gene therapy,"Previous studies have demonstrated that numerous tumor‑specific microRNAs (miRNAs) are upregulated or downregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and that their dysregulation is implicated in HCC occurrence and development. Therefore, investigation of crucial miRNAs involved in HCC oncogenesis and progression may provide novel insights into the therapy of patients with this malignant tumor. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) assays were performed to detect tissue and cellular expression levels of miRNA‑663b (miR‑663b) in HCC. The effects of miR‑663b overexpression on the proliferation and invasion of HCC cells were examined using Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Transwell invasion assays, respectively. The direct target of miR‑663b in HCC cells was determined by bioinformatics analysis, luciferase reporter assay, RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. It was observed that miR‑663b was expressed at low levels in HCC tissues and cell lines. miR‑663b upregulation suppressed the proliferative and invasive abilities of HCC cells. Additionally, Grb2‑associated binding 2 (GAB2) was regarded as a direct target gene of miR‑663b in HCC cells. Furthermore, GAB2 was overexpressed in HCC tissues, and overexpression of GAB2 was inversely correlated with levels of miR‑663b. GAB2 overexpression was able to rescue the suppressive effects of miR‑663b on HCC cells. These results demonstrated that this newly‑identified miR‑663b/GAB2 axis may be implicated in HCC occurrence and development."
30720106,gene therapy,"To identify biomarkers that could predict response or lack of response to conventional chemotherapy at the time of diagnosis of high‑grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSOC), the present study compared large‑scale gene expression from patients with short or long disease‑free survival times, according to the last cycle of chemotherapy, and validated these findings using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) and conventional immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Samples were selected for microarray evaluation, at the time of diagnosis, using the following criteria: Identical debulking primary surgery, International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics staging, histological subtype and grade. These were divided into 2 groups, regarding the outcome after 2 years of follow-up. Prostaglandin D2 synthase 21 kDa (brain) (PTGDS) was found to be expressed at a significantly higher level in the tumours of patients with a short disease‑free survival time, and this was validated by RT‑qPCR in all samples. Furthermore, the study evaluated PGD2, the protein product of the PTGDS gene, in a large cohort of 114 HGSOC patients using the Ventana Benchmark automated platform, and IHC positivity was correlated with clinicopathological data and outcome. The global gene expression analysis identified 1,149 genes that were differentially expressed in microarray data, according to the patient outcome. Further analysis RT‑qPCR validated PTGDS gene expression in the same samples (r=0.945; P<0.001). IHC analysis showed an inverse profile, with positivity for PGD2 strongly associated with an increase in disease‑free survival (P=0.009), the absence of relapse (P=0.039) and sensitivity to platinum‑based therapy (P=0.016). Multiple Cox regression showed that IHC evaluation of PGD2 was also a prognostic marker associated with relapse (hazard ratio, 0.37; P=0.002). Overall, the results showed that IHC evaluation of PGD2 is an independent marker of good prognosis in HGSOC. This finding contributes to our understanding of the mechanism of tumour regulation and to investigations into biomarkers that predict response to chemotherapy."
30720077,gene therapy,"A highly tumorigenic and malignant sub‑population of HCC containing tumor‑initiating cells (TICs) are defined by high self‑renewal and sphere formation ability. Lysyl oxidase (LOX) regulates various factors involved in extracellular matrix (ECM) maintenance, migration and angiogenesis. Certain reports have demonstrated the role of LOX in ECM crosslinking, however, the cancer‑promoting effects of LOX in HCC remain unclear, and whether LOX has a role in the regulation of angiogenesis in HCC TICs has not been elucidated. In the current study, RNA sequencing using next‑generation sequencing technology and bioinformatics analyses revealed that LOX gene expression was significantly upregulated in cell spheres. Sphere cells may form tumors with more vascular enrichment compared with tumors produced from adherent cells, as observed in a mouse xenograft model. LOX expression is correlated with increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet‑derived growth factor, as demonstrated by analyses of The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Conditioned media obtained from LOX‑overexpressing tumor cells stimulated angiogenesis via secreted VEGF and enhanced the tube formation capacity of endothelial cells. Furthermore, these functional behaviors were blocked by the LOX inhibitor β‑aminopropionitrile. These findings provide novel mechanistic insight into the pivotal role of LOX in the regulation of TICs in HCC. Combination of LOX inhibitor with sorafenib is a potentially advantageous strategy for HCC therapy."
30720068,gene therapy,"As a new group of important effector molecules involved in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, lung cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted considerable attention recently. However, the underlying cause that induces the dysregulated lncRNAs in cancer remains poorly understood. In the present study, the regulatory model of the lncRNA placenta‑specific protein 2 (PLAC2) upregulation in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was investigated and its biological functions in OSCC malignant progression was identified. A reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay identified that PLAC2 is upregulated in OSCC cell lines and primary tissue samples. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation verified an enriched histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) acetylation (H3K27ac) at the promoter region of the PLAC2 gene. Knockdown of cAMP‑response element binding protein‑binding protein (CBP) significantly reduced the enrichment level of H3K27ac, and thereby induced a decreased expression of PLAC2. Functionally, overexpression of PLAC2 promotes OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of PLAC2 exerted an opposite effect. Furthermore, the Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway was activated by PLAC2 and mediated the PLAC2‑induced malignant progress of OSCC. In conclusion, the present results indicated that lncRNA PLAC2 is transcriptionally activated by H3K27ac modification at the promoter region in OSCC, and promotes cell growth and metastasis via activating Wnt/β‑catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, PLAC2 may serve as a promising biomarker for OSCC prognosis and therapy."
30720049,gene therapy,"Beclin1, a key regulator of autophagy, has been demonstrated to be associated with cancer cell resistance to chemotherapy. Paclitaxel is a conventional chemotherapeutic drug used in the clinical treatment of breast cancer. However, the function and mechanism of Beclin1 in paclitaxel‑mediated cytotoxicity in breast cancer are not well defined. The present study demonstrated that paclitaxel suppressed cell viability and Beclin1 expression levels in BT‑474 breast cancer cells in a dose‑ and time‑dependent fashion. Compared with the control, the knockdown of Beclin1 significantly enhanced breast cancer cell death via the induction of caspase‑dependent apoptosis following paclitaxel treatment in vitro (P<0.05). In a BT‑474 xenograft model, paclitaxel achieved substantial inhibition of tumor growth in the Beclin1 knockdown group compared with the control group. Furthermore, analysis of the publicly available Gene Expression Omnibus datasets revealed a clinical correlation between Beclin1 levels and the response to paclitaxel therapy in patients with breast cancer. Collectively, the present results suggest that Beclin1 protects breast cancer cells from apoptotic death. Thus, the inhibition of Beclin1 may be a novel way to improve the effect of paclitaxel. Additionally, Beclin1 may function as a favorable prognostic biomarker for paclitaxel treatment in patients with breast cancer."
30720044,gene therapy,"Gene therapy holds the significance of correcting genetic defects. However, difficulties in the in vivo delivery to the targeted tissues and systemic delivery remain the biggest challenges to be overcome. Here, a robust system of biofunctionalized polymeric layer-mediated lentiviral delivery was designed for the site-specific spatial and temporal control of viral gene delivery. Poly glycidyl methacrylate (pGMA) modification of a substrate via initiated chemical vapor deposition (iCVD) followed by polyethyleneimine (PEI) immobilization provided the adhesion site for the lentivirus. Furthermore, the polymeric patch based gene delivery system showed a high rate of gene transduction compared to bolus treatment. Furthermore, by using mask patterning, we were able to spatially pattern the lentivirus which allowed spatially defined transfection."
30719867,gene therapy,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a common spontaneous endocrine disorder in dogs, which is defined by persistent hyperglycemia and insulin deficiency. Like type 1 diabetes (T1D) in people, canine DM is a complex and multifactorial disease in which genomic and epigenomic factors interact with environmental cues to induce pancreatic β-cell loss and insulin deficiency, although the pathogenesis of canine DM is poorly defined and the role of autoimmunity is further controversial. Both diseases are incurable and require life-long exogenous insulin therapy to maintain glucose homeostasis. Human pancreatic islet physiology, size, and cellular composition is further mirrored by canine islets. Although pancreas, or isolated islets transplantation are the only clinically validated methods to achieve long-term normoglycemia and insulin-independence, their availability does not meet the clinical need, they target a small portion of patients and have significant potential adverse effects. Therefore, providing a new source for β-cell replacement is an unmet need. Naturally occurring DM in pet dogs, as a translational platform, is an untapped resource for various regenerative medicine applications that may offer some unique advantages given dogs' large size, longevity, heterogenic genetic background, similarity to human physiology and pathology and long-term clinical management. In this review, we outline different strategies for curative approaches, animal models used, and consider the value of canine DM as a translational animal/disease model for T1D in people.

30719834,gene therapy,"Cetuximab, a monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), is being widely used for colorectal cancer (CRC) with wild-type KRAS. However, its responsiveness is still very limited and wild-type KRAS is not enough to indicate such responsiveness. Here, by analyzing the gene expression data of CRC patients treated with cetuximab monotherapy, we have identified DUSP4, ETV5, GNB5, NT5E, and PHLDA1 as potential targets to overcome cetuximab resistance. We found that knockdown of any of these 5 genes can increase cetuximab sensitivity in KRAS wild-type cells. Interestingly, we further found that GNB5 knockdown can increase cetuximab sensitivity even for KRAS mutant cells. We unraveled that GNB5 overexpression contributes to cetuximab resistance by modulating the Akt signaling pathway from experiments and mathematical simulation. Overall, these results indicate that GNB5 might be a promising target for combination therapy with cetuximab irrespective of KRAS mutation. This article is protected by copyright.

30719767,gene therapy,"A growing number of studies provide epidemiological evidence linking obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with a number of chronic disorders. Transcriptional analyses have been conducted to analyze the gene expression data. However, the weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) method has not been applied to determine the transcriptional consequence of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy in patients with severe OSA. The aim of this study was to identify key pathways and genes in patients with OSA that are influenced by CPAP treatment and uncover/unveil potential molecular mechanisms using WGCNA. We analyzed the microarray data of OSA (GSE 49800) listed in the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Coexpression modules were constructed using WGCNA. In addition, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis were also conducted. After the initial data processing, 5101 expressed gene profiles were identified. Next, a weighted gene coexpression network was established and 16 modules of coexpressed genes were identified. The interaction analysis demonstrated a relative independence of gene expression in these modules. The black module, tan module, midnightblue module, pink module, and greenyellow module were significantly associated with the alterations in circulating leukocyte gene expression at baseline and after exposure to CPAP. The five hub genes were considered to be candidate OSA-related genes after CPAP treatment. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that steroid biosynthesis, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the insulin signaling pathway play critical roles in the development of OSA in circulating leukocyte gene expression at baseline and after exposure to CPAP. Using this new systems biology approach, we identified several genes and pathways that appear to be critical to OSA after CPAP treatment, and these findings provide a better understanding of OSA pathogenesis."
30719704,gene therapy,"We present an evolutionary analysis of the relative time of genetic events underlying tumorigenesis in human bladder cancers from ten whole cystectomy specimens using multiregional whole exome sequencing. We timed bladder cancer drivers, mutational signatures, ploidy and copy number alterations, provided evidence for kataegis and correlated alterations with tumour areas and histological phenotypes. We found that: i) heterogeneous tumour areas/phenotypes had distinct driver mutations, ii) papillary-invasive tumours divided early into two parallel evolving branches, and iii) parallel evolution of subclonal driver mutations occurred. APOBEC mutational signatures were found to be very early events, active in carcinoma in situ (CIS), and often remained a dominant source of mutations throughout tumour evolution. Genetic progression from CIS followed driver mutations in NA13/FAT1, ZBTB7B or EP300/USP28/KMT2D. Our results point toward a more diverse mutational trajectory of bladder tumorigenesis, and underpin the importance of timing of mutational processes and clonal architecture in bladder cancer as important aspects for successful prognostication and therapy.

30719608,gene therapy,"Quorum sensing, bacterial cell-to-cell communication via small signaling molecules regulates virulence in many bacterial pathogens, and is a promising target for antivirulence therapy, which may inhibit virulence rather than cell growth and division. Herein, Bacillus strains capable of degrading QS molecules from freshwater environments were screened as potential aquaculture probiotics. A total of 34 Bacillus strains were isolated. Strain T-1 was selected with ""H"" streaking and double layer agar plate methods using Chromabacterium violaceum ATCC12472 as reporter, and eventually identified as Bacillus licheniformis based on biochemical and molecular identification. Quorum quenching by T-1 was confirmed using C. violaceum CV026. T-1 was non-hemolytic in vitro. In biocontrol experiments, T-1 reduced the pathogenicity of Aeromonas hydrophila cb15 in zebrafish co-injected intraperitoneally with both strains, achieving a relative percentage survival of 70%. Determination and analysis of the T-1 draft genome using the Illumina Hiseq 2500 platform identified the quorum quenching gene ytnP, encoding an acyl-homoserine lactone metallo-β-lactamase, as a potential QS quencher in T-1. In conclusion, B. licheniformis T-1 could be a safe and effective quorum quenching bacterium for protecting hosts against pathogenic bacterial infections in aquaculture."
30719606,gene therapy,"Cutaneous melanoma (CM) is an extremely aggressive cancer presenting low survival and high mortality. The vast majority of patients affected by this disease does not respond or show resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs, which makes the treatment ineffective. In this sense, the necessity for the development of new agents to assist in CM therapy is extremely important. One of the sources of great interest in this search are compounds of natural origin. Among these compounds, caffeic acid has demonstrated a broad spectrum of pharmacological activities as well as antitumor effects in some types of cancer. Therefore, the objective of this work was to investigate the possible antitumor effect of caffeic acid on the SK-Mel-28 cell line, human CM cells. Cells were cultured in flasks with culture medium containing fetal bovine serum, antibiotic, and antifungal, and maintained in ideal conditions. Cells were treated with 25 µM, 50 µM, 100 µM, 150 µM and 200 µM of caffeic acid and dacarbazine at 1 mg/mL. We verified the effect on cell viability and cell death, apoptosis, cell cycle, colony formation and gene expression of caspases. Results showed a decrease in cell viability, cell death induction by apoptosis, inhibition of colony formation, modulation of cell cycle and alterations in gene expression of caspases after caffeic acid treatment. These results suggest an antitumor effect of the compound on SK-Mel-28 cells. This study provides original information on mechanisms by which caffeic acid may play a key role in preventing tumor progression in human melanoma cells."
30719487,gene therapy,"While anti-angiogenic therapies for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) are effective for many patients, they require multiple injections and are expensive and prone to complications. Gene therapy could be an elegant solution for this problem by providing a long-term source of anti-angiogenic proteins after a single administration. Another potential issue with current therapeutic proteins containing a fragment crystallizable (Fc) domain (such as whole antibodies like bevacizumab) is the induction of an unwanted immune response. In wet AMD, a low level of inflammation is already present, so to avoid exacerbation of disease by the therapeutic protein, we propose single-chain fragment variable (scFv) antibodies, which lack the Fc domain, as a safer alternative. To investigate the feasibility of this, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-blocking antibodies in two formats were produced and tested <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The scFv transgene was then cloned into an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector. A therapeutic effect in a mouse model of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was demonstrated with antibodies in both scFv and immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) formats (p < 0.04). Importantly, the scFv anti-VEGF antibody expressed from an AAV vector also had a significant beneficial effect (p = 0.02), providing valuable preclinical data for future translation to the clinic."
30719486,gene therapy,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector-mediated gene delivery is a promising approach for therapy, but implementation in the eye currently is hampered by the need for delivering the vector underneath the retina, using surgical application into the subretinal space. This limits the extent of the retina that is treated and may cause surgical injury. Vector delivery into the vitreous cavity would be preferable because it is surgically less invasive and would reach more of the retina. Unfortunately, most conventional, non-modified AAV vector serotypes penetrate the retina poorly from the vitreous; this limits efficient transduction and expression by target cells (retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors). We developed a method of applying a small and safe electric current across the intact eye <i>in vivo</i> for a brief period following intravitreal vector administration. This significantly improved AAV-mediated transduction of retinal cells in wild-type mice following intravitreal delivery, with gene expression in retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. The low-level current had no adverse effects on retinal structure and function. This method should be generally applicable for other AAV serotypes and may have broad application in both basic research and clinical studies."

Disruption of the gut microbiota has been associated with gastrointestinal diseases such as colorectal cancer. The genus <i>Bifidobacterium</i> is considered an important component of the commensal microbiota and plays important roles in several homeostatic functions: immune, neurohormonal, and metabolic. <i>Bifidobacterium animalis</i> subsp. <i>lactis</i> is a well-documented probiotic within the species <i>Bifidobacterium.</i> Mycosporin-like amino acids are low molecular weight amino acids demonstrated to exert prebiotic effects and to modulate host immunity by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, macrophages and lymphocytes, as well as cytokine production.Their modulation of the metabolism of the immune system and transcription factors could exert a beneficial effect on colorectal cancer. <i>B. animalis</i> does not produce mycosporin-like amino acids. If one could create a <i>B. animalis</i>-producing mycosporin-like amino acids via genetic open reading frame engineering it should exert more potent immuno-stimulatory properties and, thereby, become a potent strain-specific microbial based therapy in colorectal cancer prevention."
30719278,gene therapy,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder and characterized by progressive locomotive defects and loss of dopaminergic neurons (DA neuron). Currently, there is no potent therapy to cure PD, and the medications merely support to control the symptoms. It is difficult to develop an effective treatment, since the PD onset mechanism of PD is still unclear. Oxidative stress is considered as a major cause of neurodegenerative diseases, and there is increasing evidence for the association between PD and oxidative stress. Therefore, antioxidant treatment may be a promising therapy for PD. <i>Drosophila</i> with knockdown of <i>dUCH</i>, a homolog of <i>UCH-L1</i> which is a PD-related gene, exhibited PD-like phenotypes including progressive locomotive impairments and DA neuron degeneration. Moreover, knockdown of <i>dUCH</i> led to elevated level of ROS. Thus, <i>dUCH</i> knockdown flies can be used as a model for screening of potential antioxidants for treating PD. Previous studies demonstrated that curcumin at 1 mM and vitamin C at 0.5 mM could improve PD-like phenotypes induced by this knockdown. With the purpose of further investigating the efficiency of vitamin C in PD treatment, we used <i>dUCH</i> knockdown <i>Drosophila</i> model to examine the dose- and time-dependent effects of vitamin C on PD-like phenotypes. The results showed that although vitamin C exerted neuroprotective effects, high doses of vitamin C and long-term treatment with this antioxidant also resulted in side effects on physiology. It is suggested that dose-dependent effects of vitamin C should be considered when used for treating PD."
30719265,gene therapy,"Epigenetics refers to the regulation of gene expression mainly by changes in DNA methylation and modifications of histone proteins without altering the actual DNA sequence. While epigenetic modifications are essential for normal cell differentiation, several driver mutations in leukemic pathogenesis have been identified in genes that affect epigenetic processes, such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation. Several therapeutic options to target epigenetic alterations in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have been successfully tested in preclinical studies and various drugs have already been approved for use in clinical practice. Among these already approved therapeutics are hypomethylating agents (azacitidine and decitabine) and isocitrate dehydrogenase inhibitors (ivosidenib, enasidenib). Other agents such as bromodomain-containing epigenetic reader proteins and histone methylation (e.g. DOT1L) inhibitors are currently in advanced clinical testing. As several epigenetic therapies have only limited efficacy when used as single agents, combination therapies that target AML pathogenesis at different levels and exploit synergistic mechanisms are also in clinical trials. Combinations of either epigenetic therapies with conventional chemotherapy, different forms of epigenetic therapies, or epigenetic therapies with immunotherapy are showing promising early results. In this review we summarize the underlying pathophysiology and rationale for epigenetically-based combination therapies, review current preclinical and clinical data and discuss the future directions of epigenetic therapy combinations in AML."
30719240,gene therapy,"The oral mucosa exhibits unique regenerative properties, sometimes referred to as foetal-like wound healing. Researchers from our institute have used sheets of oral mucosa epithelial cells (OMECs) for regenerative medicine applications including cornea replacement and oesophageal epithelial regeneration for stricture prevention. Here, we have isolated exosomes from clinical-grade production of OMEC sheets from healthy human donors (<i>n</i> = 8), aiming to evaluate the clinical potential of the exosomes to stimulate epithelial regeneration and to improve understanding of the mode-of-action of the cells. Exosomes were isolated from conditioned (cExo) and non-conditioned (ncExo) media. Characterization was performed using Western blot for common exosomal-markers: CD9 and flotillin were positive while annexin V, EpCam and contaminating marker GRP94 were negative. Nanoparticle tracking analysis revealed a diameter of ~120 nm and transmission electron microscopy showed a corresponding size and spherical appearance. Human skin fibroblasts exposed to exosomes showed dose-dependent reduction of proliferation and a considerable increase of growth factor gene expression (HGF, VEGFA, FGF2 and CTGF). The results were similar for both groups, but with a trend towards a larger effect from cExo. To study adhesion, fluorescently labelled exosomes were topically applied to pig oesophageal wound-beds <i>ex vivo</i> and subsequently washed. Positive signal could be detected after as little as 1 min of adhesion, but increased adhesion time produced a stronger signal. Next, labelled exosomes were added to full-thickness skin wounds in rats and signal was detected up to 5 days after application. cExo significantly reduced the wound size at days 6 and 17. In conclusion, exosomes from OMEC sheets showed pro-regenerative effects on skin wound healing. This is the first time that the healing capacity of the oral mucosa is studied from an exosome perspective. These findings might lead to a combinational therapy of cell sheets and exosomes for future patients with early oesophageal cancer."
30719230,gene therapy,"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) pathways are known to play an important role in tumor cell proliferation of glioblastoma (GBM). Cellular determinants of RTK-inhibitor sensitivity are important to optimize and tailor treatment strategies. The stress response gene activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) is involved in homeostasis and cellular protection. However, little is known about its function in GBM. We found that the ATF4/p-eIF2α pathway is activated in response to Sunitinib in primary tumor initiating progenitor cell cultures (BTICs). Furthermore, lysosome entrapment of RTK-inhibitors (RTK-Is) leads to accumulation of autophagosomes. In case of Sunitinib treated cells, autophagy is additionally increased by ATF4 mediated upregulation of autophagy genes. Inhibition of ATF4 by small interfering RNA (siRNA) reduced autophagy and cell proliferation after Sunitinib treatment in a subset of BTIC cultures. Overall, this study suggests a pro-survival role of the ATF4/p-eIF2α pathway in a cell type and treatment specific manner."
30719229,gene therapy,"FR901464 (FR) was first described as an anticancer drug and later identified as a modulator of splicing factor 3B subunit 1 (SF3B1). Although the effectiveness of splicing modulators has been investigated in colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, their usefulness in animal experiments has not been confirmed. The association of <i>SF3B1</i> with CRC progression and the influence of FR on transcriptional activity in CRC has not been fully elucidated. FR showed strong cytotoxicity against CRC cell lines, <i>SF3B1</i>-mutated cancer cell lines, and human fibroblasts with IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 1 ng/ml. FR-resistant clones derived from HCT116, DLD1, Lovo, and CT26 cells showed IC<sub>50</sub> values greater than 100 ng/ml. <i>SF3B1</i> sequencing demonstrated low frequencies of <i>SF3B1</i> mutations in CRC and mutations in codon 1074 of exon 22 in all FR-resistant clones. Unlike hematological malignancies, <i>SF3B1</i> expression was not associated with CRC progression. Although FR showed significant growth inhibition in a xenograft model of RKO cells, severe toxicity was also induced. These data indicated CRC might be a suitable target of FR unless toxicity occurs. Microarray analysis and real-time quantitative PCR demonstrated downregulation of genes associated with Fanconi anemia (<i>BRCA1 and BRCA2</i>) and 28 driver oncogenes. These data suggested combination treatment of FR with other anticancer drugs whose sensitivity is associated with genes affected by FR treatment. Combination treatment with PARP1 inhibitor olaparib, whose sensitivity was enhanced by <i>BRCA</i> 1/2 deficiency, showed synergistic effects in CRC cells. Our data indicates the potential of FR in combination therapy rather than monotherapy for CRC treatment."
30719217,gene therapy,"Hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS) is a rare and highly lethal malignancy with few effective systemic treatments. Relatively little is known about the genetic abnormalities that drive this disease. As a result, there has been minimal progress towards applying targeted therapies to the treatment of HAS. We describe the first reported case of a patient with HAS that harbored a fusion of <i>ROS1</i> with <i>GOPC/FIG</i>. Similar to other rearrangements involving <i>ROS1</i>, the resulting fusion protein is believed to act as a major driver of carcinogenesis and may be subject to inhibition by drugs that target <i>ROS1</i> such as crizotinib. We then queried the MSK-IMPACT clinical sequencing cohort and cBioportal datasets, demonstrating the previously unknown prevalence of <i>ROS1-GOPC</i> fusions in soft tissue sarcomas and hepatobiliary cancers. Amplification of these genes was also found to correlate with reduced overall survival. This is followed by a review of the role played by <i>ROS1</i> rearrangements in cancer, as well as the evidence supporting the use of targeted therapies against the resulting fusion protein. We suggest that testing for ROS1 fusion and, if positive, treatment with a targeted therapy could be considered at the time of diagnosis for patients with angiosarcoma. This report also highlights the need for further investigation into the molecular pathophysiology of this deadly disease."
30719171,gene therapy,"Epigenetic modifications at the histone level have attracted significant attention because of their roles in tumorigenesis. Suppressor of variegation 3-9 homolog 2 (SUV39H2, also known as KMT1B) is a member of the SUV39 subfamily of lysine methyltransferases (KMTs) that plays a significant role in histone H3-K9 di-/tri-methylation, transcriptional regulation and cell cycle. Overexpressions of SUV39H2 at gene, mRNA and protein levels are known to be associated with a range of cancers: leukemia, lymphomas, lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, hepatocellular cancer and so on. Accumulating evidence indicates that SUV39H2 acts as an oncogene and contributes to the initiation and progression of cancers. It could, therefore, be a promising target for anti-cancer treatment. In this review, we focus on the dysregulation of SUV39H2 in cancers, including its clinical prognostic predictor role, molecular mechanism involved in cancer occurrence and development, relevant inhibitors against cancer, and its epigenetic modification interaction with immunotherapy. A better understanding of the SUV39H2 will be beneficial to the development of molecular-targeted therapies in cancer."
30719024,gene therapy,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most common cancers, with a high incidence of cancer death. Despite various therapeutic approaches, the cures and prognosis of advanced GC remain poor. Natural killer (NK) cells, which are known as important lymphocytes in innate immunity, play vital roles in suppressing GC initiation, progression, and metastases. A wide range of clinical settings shows that increasing the number of NK cells or improving NK cell antitumor activity is promising in GC patients. NK cell adoptive therapy (especially expanded NK cells) is a safe and well-tolerated method, which can enhance NK cell cytotoxicity against GC. Meanwhile, cytokines, immunomodulatory drugs, immune checkpoint blockades, antibodies, vaccines, and gene therapy have been found to directly or indirectly activate NK cells to improve their killing activity toward GC. In this review, we summarize recent advancements in the relationship between NK cells and GC and point out all the innovative strategies that can enhance NK cells' function to inhibit the growth of GC."
30718967,gene therapy,"Antihypertensive drug therapies have been reported to be associated with new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus in some hypertensive patients after prolonged use. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene has been found to affect essential hypertension, response of antihypertensive therapies, and glycemic disturbances. Therefore, ACE gene I/D polymorphism may be associated with risk of new onset of type 2 diabetes via metabolic disturbances, glycemic dysregulation, and insulin resistance."
30718921,gene therapy,"The aberrant activation of the ERG oncogenic pathway due to the TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion is the major event that contributes to prostate cancer (PCa) development. However, the critical downstream effectors that can be therapeutically targeted remain to be identified. In this study, we have found that the expression of the α1 and β1 subunits of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) was directly and specifically regulated by ERG in vitro and in vivo and was significantly associated with TMPRSS2-ERG fusion in clinical PCa cohorts. sGC is the major mediator of nitric oxide (NO)-cGMP signaling in cells that, upon NO binding, catalyzes the synthesis of cGMP and subsequently activates protein kinase G (PKG). We showed that cGMP synthesis was significantly elevated by ERG in PCa cells, leading to increased PKG activity and cell proliferation. Importantly, we also demonstrated that sGC inhibitor treatment repressed tumor growth in TMPRSS2-ERG-positive PCa xenograft models and can act in synergy with a potent AR antagonist, enzalutamide. This study strongly suggests that targeting NO-cGMP signaling pathways may be a novel therapeutic strategy to treat PCa with TMPRSS2-ERG gene fusion."

Microbial functions in the physiology result from the microbiota-host coevolution has profoundly affected host metabolism. Here, we sought to determine how beneficial microbiome caused by RSV interventions affects antiobesity."
30718813,gene therapy,"Hereditary cancer disorders often provide an important window into novel mechanisms supporting tumor growth. Understanding these mechanisms thus represents a vital goal. Toward this goal, here we report a chemoproteomic map of fumarate, a covalent oncometabolite whose accumulation marks the genetic cancer syndrome hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC). We applied a fumarate-competitive chemoproteomic probe in concert with LC-MS/MS to discover new cysteines sensitive to fumarate hydratase (FH) mutation in HLRCC cell models. Analysis of this dataset revealed an unexpected influence of local environment and pH on fumarate reactivity, and enabled the characterization of a novel FH-regulated cysteine residue that lies at a key protein-protein interface in the SWI-SNF tumor-suppressor complex. Our studies provide a powerful resource for understanding the covalent imprint of fumarate on the proteome and lay the foundation for future efforts to exploit this distinct aspect of oncometabolism for cancer diagnosis and therapy."
30718755,gene therapy,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) provide a unique platform for individualized cell therapy approaches. Currently, episomal DNA, mRNA, and Sendai virus-based RNA reprogramming systems are widely used to generate iPSCs. However, they all rely on the use of multiple (three to six) components (vectors/plasmids/mRNAs) leading to the production of partially reprogrammed cells, reducing the efficiency of the systems. We produced a one-cycle measles virus (MV) vector by substituting the viral attachment protein gene with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. Here, we present a highly efficient multi-transgene delivery system based on a vaccine strain of MV, a non-integrating RNA virus that has a long-standing safety record in humans. Introduction of the four reprogramming factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and cMYC via a single, ""one-cycle"" MV vector efficiently reprogrammed human somatic cells into iPSCs, whereas MV vector genomes are rapidly eliminated in derived iPSCs. Our MV vector system offers a new reprogramming platform for genomic modification-free iPSCs amenable for clinical translation."
30718709,gene therapy,"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a common cause of visual impairment. IRD covers a set of genetically highly heterogeneous disorders with more than 150 genes associated with one or more clinical forms of IRD. Molecular genetic diagnosis has become increasingly important especially due to expanding number of gene therapy strategies under development. Next generation sequencing (NGS) of gene panels has proven a valuable diagnostic tool in IRD. We present the molecular findings of 677 individuals, residing in Denmark, with IRD and report 806 variants of which 187 are novel. We found that deletions and duplications spanning one or more exons can explain 3% of the cases, and thus copy number variation (CNV) analysis is important in molecular genetic diagnostics of IRD. Seven percent of the individuals have variants classified as pathogenic or likely-pathogenic in more than one gene. Possible Danish founder variants in EYS and RP1 are reported. A significant number of variants were classified as variants with unknown significance; reporting of these will hopefully contribute to the elucidation of the actual clinical consequence making the classification less troublesome in the future. In conclusion, this study underlines the relevance of performing targeted sequencing of IRD including CNV analysis as well as the importance of interaction with clinical diagnoses."
30718541,gene therapy,"Preclinical studies point to a pivotal role of the orexin 1 (OX<sub>1</sub>) receptor in arousal and fear learning and therefore suggest the HCRTR1 gene as a prime candidate in panic disorder (PD) with/without agoraphobia (AG), PD/AG treatment response, and PD/AG-related intermediate phenotypes. Here, a multilevel approach was applied to test the non-synonymous HCRTR1 C/T Ile408Val gene variant (rs2271933) for association with PD/AG in two independent case-control samples (total n = 613 cases, 1839 healthy subjects), as an outcome predictor of a six-weeks exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in PD/AG patients (n = 189), as well as with respect to agoraphobic cognitions (ACQ) (n = 483 patients, n = 2382 healthy subjects), fMRI alerting network activation in healthy subjects (n = 94), and a behavioral avoidance task in PD/AG pre- and post-CBT (n = 271). The HCRTR1 rs2271933 T allele was associated with PD/AG in both samples independently, and in their meta-analysis (p = 4.2 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), particularly in the female subsample (p = 9.8 × 10<sup>-9</sup>). T allele carriers displayed a significantly poorer CBT outcome (e.g., Hamilton anxiety rating scale: p = 7.5 × 10<sup>-4</sup>). The T allele count was linked to higher ACQ sores in PD/AG and healthy subjects, decreased inferior frontal gyrus and increased locus coeruleus activation in the alerting network. Finally, the T allele count was associated with increased pre-CBT exposure avoidance and autonomic arousal as well as decreased post-CBT improvement. In sum, the present results provide converging evidence for an involvement of HCRTR1 gene variation in the etiology of PD/AG and PD/AG-related traits as well as treatment response to CBT, supporting future therapeutic approaches targeting the orexin-related arousal system."
30718505,gene therapy,"The immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment limits the success of current immunotherapies. The host retains memory T cells specific for previous infections throughout the entire body that are capable of executing potent and immediate immunostimulatory functions. Here we show that virus-specific memory T cells extend their surveillance to mouse and human tumors. Reactivating these antiviral T cells can arrest growth of checkpoint blockade-resistant and poorly immunogenic tumors in mice after injecting adjuvant-free non-replicating viral peptides into tumors. Peptide mimics a viral reinfection event to memory CD8+ T cells, triggering antigen presentation and cytotoxic pathways within the tumor, activating dendritic cells and natural killer cells, and recruiting the adaptive immune system. Viral peptide treatment of ex vivo human tumors recapitulates immune activation gene expression profiles observed in mice. Lastly, peptide therapy renders resistant mouse tumors susceptible to PD-L1 blockade. Thus, re-stimulating known antiviral immunity may provide a unique therapeutic approach for cancer immunotherapy."
30718451,gene therapy,"The identification of new predictive biomarkers and therapeutic target for tailored therapy in breast cancer onset and progression is an interesting challenge. OLR-1 gene encodes the cell membrane receptor LOX-1 (lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor). We have recently identified a novel alternative OLR-1 isoform, LOX-1Δ4, whose expression and functions are still not clarified. In the present paper, we demonstrated that LOX-1 is overexpressed in 70% of human breast cancer (n = 47) and positively correlated to the tumor stage and grade (p < 0.01). Observations on LOX-1 and its splice variant Δ4 pointed out a different expression pattern correlated to breast cancer phenotypes. Overexpressing LOX-1 and LOX-1Δ4 in vitro, we obtained a strong enhancement of proliferative rate and a downregulation of cell death-related proteins. In addition, we observed a strong modulation of histone H4 acetylation and Ku70, the limiting factor of DNA double-strand breaks repair machinery implied in apoptosis inhibition and drug resistance acquisition. Moreover, LOX-1Δ4 overexpression is able to increase proliferation in a non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line, MCF12-F, acting as an oncogene. Altogether, these results suggest that LOX-1 may acts as a molecular link among metabolism, inflammation and cancer, indicating its potential role as biomarker and new molecular target, representing an attractive and concrete opportunity to improve current strategies for breast cancer tailored therapy."
30718378,gene therapy,"Revertant mosaicism is a phenomenon in which pathogenic mutations are rescued by somatic events, representing a form of natural gene therapy. Here, we report on the first evidence for revertant mosaicism in loricrin keratoderma (LK), an autosomal dominant form of ichthyosis caused by mutations in <i>LOR</i> on 1q21.3. We identified two unrelated LK families exhibiting dozens of previously unreported white spots, which increased in both number and size with age. Biopsies of these spots revealed that they had normal histology and that causal <i>LOR</i> mutations were lost. Notably, dense single nucleotide polymorphism mapping identified independent copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity events on chromosome 1q extending from regions centromeric to <i>LOR</i> to the telomere in all investigated spots, suggesting that somatic recombination represents a common reversion mechanism in LK. Furthermore, we demonstrated that reversion of <i>LOR</i> mutations confers a growth advantage to cells in vitro, but the clinically limited size of revertant spots suggests the existence of mechanisms constraining revertant clone expansion. Nevertheless, the identification of revertant mosaicism in LK might pave the way for revertant therapy for this intractable disease."

Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive form of CTCL characterized by significant presence of malignant cells in both the blood and skin. The guarded prognosis for SS reflects a lack of reliably effective therapy, due in part to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis."
30718211,gene therapy,"Fetal anemia has been known for many years as a dangerous complication of pregnancy. Its most common causes are maternal alloimmunization and parvovirus B19 infection, although it can be associated with many different pathological conditions including fetal aneuploidies, vascular tumors, and arteriovenous malformations of the fetus or placenta and inherited conditions such as alpha-thalassemia or genetic metabolic disorders. Doppler ultrasonographic assessment of the peak velocity of systolic blood flow in the middle cerebral artery for the diagnosis of fetal anemia and intravascular intrauterine transfusion for its treatment are the current practice standards. Live birth rates as high as 95% have been reported in recent years. The additional role of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy and the long-term consequences of the condition are the subjects of active ongoing research."
30718090,gene therapy,"Gene therapies using adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors have advanced into clinical trials for several diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). A limitation of AAV is the carrying capacity (∼5 kb) available for genes and regulatory cassettes (RCs). These size constraints are problematic for the 2.2-Mb dystrophin gene. We previously designed a variety of miniaturized micro-dystrophins (μDys) that displayed significant, albeit incomplete, function in striated muscles. To develop μDys proteins with improved performance, we explored structural modifications of the dystrophin central rod domain. Eight μDys variants were studied that carried unique combinations of between four and six of the 24 spectrin-like repeats present in the full-length protein, as well as various hinge domains. Expression of μDys was regulated by a strong but compact muscle-restricted RC (CK8e) or by the ubiquitously active cytomegalovirus (CMV) RC. Vectors were evaluated by intramuscular injection and systemic delivery to dystrophic mdx<sup>4cv</sup> mice, followed by analysis of skeletal muscle pathophysiology. Two μDys designs were identified that led to increased force generation compared with previous μDys while also localizing neuronal nitric oxide synthase to the sarcolemma. An AAV vector expressing the smaller of these (μDys5) from the CK8e RC is currently being evaluated in a DMD clinical trial."
30717907,gene therapy,"Systemic therapy options have emerged for treatment of progressive, radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid carcinoma. Approved therapies that target tumor angiogenesis, lenvatinib and sorafenib, improve progression-free survival and, in an older subset, lenvatinib can prolong overall survival. Treatments based on targeting specific somatic genetic alterations are also available, which potentially also may prolong progression-free survival but are not yet approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration for this specific disease. More novel approaches that may benefit select patients include resensitization therapies that allow further radioiodine utilization and new immunotherapy concepts."
30717770,gene therapy,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) culminating into heart failure (HF) are major causes of death in men and women. Prevalence and manifestation, however, differ between sexes, since men mainly present with coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI), and post-menopausal women predominantly present with hypertension. These discrepancies are probably influenced by underlying genetic and molecular differences in structural remodeling pathways involved in hypertrophy, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis. In general, men mainly develop eccentric forms, while women develop concentric forms of hypertrophy. Besides that, women show less inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis upon HF. This seems to emerge, at least partially, from the fact that the underlying pathways might be modulated by estrogen, which changes after menopause due to declining of the estrogen levels."

30717609,gene therapy,"Traditional sex-related biases in research are now obsolete, and it is important to identify the sex of humans, animals, and even cells in research protocols, due to the role of sex as a fundamental facet of biology, predisposition to disease, and response to therapy. Genetic sex, epigenetics and hormonal regulations, generate sex-dimorphisms. Recent investigations acknowledge sex differences in metabolic and immune health as well as chronic diseases. Prohibitin, an evolutionarily conserved molecule, has pleotropic functions in mitochondrial housekeeping, plasma membrane signaling, and nuclear genetic transcription. Studies in adipocytes, macrophages, and transgenic mice indicate that prohibitin interacts with sex steroids and plays a role in mediating sex differences in adipose tissues and immune cell types. Prohibitin may, depending on context, modulate predisposition to chronic metabolic diseases and malignancy and, because of these attributes, could be a target for sex-based therapies of metabolic and immune-related diseases as well as cancer."
30717462,gene therapy,"Excess iron causes cancer and is thought to be related to carcinogenesis and cancer progression including stemness, but the details remain unclear. Here, we hypothesized that stemness in cancer is related to iron metabolism and that regulating iron metabolism in cancer stem cells (CSCs) may be a novel therapy. In this study, we used murine induced pluripotent stem cells that expressed specific stem cell genes such as <i>Nanog</i>, <i>Oct3/4</i>, <i>Sox2</i>, <i>Klf4</i>, and <i>c-Myc</i>, and two human cancer cell lines with similar stem cell gene expression. Deferasirox, an orally available iron chelator, suppressed expression of stemness markers and spherogenesis of cells with high stemness status in vitro. Combination therapy had a marked antitumor effect compared with deferasirox or cisplatin alone. Iron metabolism appears important for maintenance of stemness in CSCs. An iron chelator combined with chemotherapy may be a novel approach via suppressing stemness for CSC targeted therapy."
30717461,gene therapy,"Therapeutic dendritic cell (DC) cancer vaccines rely on the immune system to eradicate tumour cells. Although tumour antigen-specific T cell responses have been observed in most studies, clinical responses are fairly low, arguing for the need to improve the design of DC-based vaccines. The incorporation of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against immunosuppressive factors in the manufacturing process of DCs can turn the vaccine into potent immune stimulators. Additionally, siRNA modification of ex vivo-expanded T cells for adoptive immunotherapy enhanced their killing potency. Most of the siRNA-targeted immune inhibitory factors have been successful in that their blockade produced the strongest cytotoxic T cell responses in preclinical and clinical studies. Cancer patients treated with the siRNA-modified DC vaccines showed promising clinical benefits providing a strong rationale for further development of these immunogenic vaccine formulations. This review covers the progress in combining siRNAs with DC vaccines or T cell therapy to boost anti-tumour immunity."
30717399,gene therapy,"Viral vector-mediated gene therapy has grown by leaps and bounds over the past several years. Although the reasons for this progress are varied, a deeper understanding of the basic biology of the viruses, the identification of new and improved versions of viral vectors, and simply the vast experience gained by extensive testing in both animal models of disease and in clinical trials, have been key factors. Several studies have investigated the efficacy of adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors in the mouse model of fragile X syndrome where AAVs have been used to express fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which is missing or highly reduced in the disorder. These studies have demonstrated a range of efficacies in different tests from full correction, to partial rescue, to no effect. Here we provide a backdrop of recent advances in AAV gene therapy as applied to central nervous system disorders, outline the salient features of the fragile X studies, and discuss several key issues for moving forward. Collectively, the findings to date from the mouse studies on fragile X syndrome, and data from clinical trials testing AAVs in other neurological conditions, indicate that AAV-mediated gene therapy could be a viable strategy for treating fragile X syndrome."
30717315,gene therapy,"In order to find out the most valuable biomarkers and pathways for diagnosis, therapy and prognosis in colorectal cancer (CRC) we have collected the published CRC biomarkers and established a CRC biomarker database (CBD: http://sysbio.suda.edu.cn/CBD/index.html). In this study, we analysed the single and multiple DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers as well as their positions in cancer related pathways and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks to describe their potential applications in diagnosis, therapy and prognosis. CRC biomarkers were collected from the CBD. The RNA and protein biomarkers were matched to their corresponding DNAs by the miRDB database and the PubMed Gene database, respectively. The PPI networks were used to investigate the relationships between protein biomarkers and further detect the multiple biomarkers. The Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation were used to analyse biological functions of the biomarkers. AI classification techniques were utilized to further verify the significances of the multiple biomarkers in diagnosis and prognosis for CRC. We showed that a large number of the DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers were associated with the diagnosis, therapy and prognosis in various degrees in the CRC biomarker networks. The CRC biomarkers were closely related to the CRC initiation and progression. Moreover, the biomarkers played critical roles in cellular proliferation, apoptosis and angiogenesis and they were involved in Ras, p53 and PI3K pathways. There were overlaps among the DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers. AI classification verifications showed that the combined multiple protein biomarkers played important roles to accurate early diagnosis and predict outcome for CRC. There were several single and multiple CRC protein biomarkers which were associated with diagnosis, therapy and prognosis in CRC. Further, AI-assisted analysis revealed that multiple biomarkers had potential applications for diagnosis and prognosis in CRC."
30717310,gene therapy,"Successful RNAi applications depend on strategies allowing stable and persistent expression of minimal gene silencing triggers without perturbing endogenous gene expression. In this study, we proposed an endogenous microRNA (miRNA) cluster as a novel integration site for small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). We successfully integrated exogenous shRNAs at the porcine <i>miRNA-17-92</i> (p<i>miR-17-92</i>) cluster via a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knock-in strategy. The anti-EGFP or anti-CSFV shRNAs could be stably and effectively expressed at the control of the endogenous promoter of the p<i>miR-17-92</i> cluster. Importantly, we confirmed that hitchhike expression of anti- classical swine fever (CSFV) shRNA had no effect on cell growth, blastocyst development and endogenous p<i>miR-17-92</i> expression in selected transgene (TG) porcine fetal fibroblasts (PFFs) clones. Moreover, these TG PFFs could inhibit the replication of CSFV by half and could be further used for generation of transgenic pigs. Taken together, these results show that our RNA interference (RNAi) expression strategy benefits numerous applications, from miRNA, genome and transgenic research, to gene therapy."

The meeting included presentations on current research on non-human primate and non-primate foamy viruses (FVs; also called spumaretroviruses) as well as keynote talks on related research areas in retroviruses. The taxonomy of foamy viruses was updated earlier this year to create five new genera in the subfamily, <i>Spumaretrovirinae</i>, based on their animal hosts. Research on viruses from different genera was presented on topics of potential relevance to human health, such as natural infections and cross-species transmission, replication, and viral-host interactions in particular with the immune system, dual retrovirus infections, virus structure and biology, and viral vectors for gene therapy. This article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-field, summarizes the meeting highlights, and presents some important questions that need to be addressed in the future."
30717206,gene therapy,"<i>Background and objective</i><b>:</b> Despite recent advances in treatment, glioblastoma (GBM) remains the most lethal and aggressive brain tumor. A continuous search for a reliable molecular marker establishes the methylation status of the O6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (<i>MGMT</i>) gene promoter as a key prognostic factor in primary glioblastoma. The aim of our study was to screen Serbian patients with primary glioblastoma for an <i>MGMT</i> promoter hypermethylation and to evaluate its associations with overall survival (OS) and sensitivity to temozolomide (TMZ) treatment. <i>Materials and methods</i><b>:</b> A cohort of 30 Serbian primary glioblastoma patients treated with radiation therapy and chemotherapy were analyzed for <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation and correlated with clinical data. <i>Results:</i><i>MGMT</i> methylation status was determined in 25 out of 30 primary glioblastomas by methylation-specific PCR (MSP). <i>MGMT</i> promoter hypermethylation was detected in 12 out of 25 patients (48%). The level of <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation did not correlate with patients' gender (<i>p</i> = 0.409), age (<i>p</i> = 0.536), and OS (<i>p</i> = 0.394). Treatment with TMZ significantly prolonged the median survival of a patient (from 5 to 15 months; <i>p</i> < 0.001). <i>Conclusions:</i> Due to a small cohort of primary GBM patients, our study is not sufficient for definitive conclusions regarding the prognostic value of <i>MGMT</i> methylation for the Serbian population. Our preliminary data suggest a lack of association between <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation and overall survival and a significant correlation of TMZ treatment with overall survival. Further population-based studies are needed to assess the prognostic value of the <i>MGMT</i> promoter methylation status for patients with primary glioblastoma."
30716792,gene therapy,"Sentinel lymph node (SLN) property assessment (with or without metastasis) is important while deciding the surgery for breast cancer; however, the current diagnosis of SLN metastasis remains to be studied. microRNAs (miRNAs) have been previously confirmed as a molecular marker for the diagnosis, development, and prognosis of tumors. However, the detailed role of miRNAs in the diagnosis of SLN metastasis has not been reported."
30716718,gene therapy,"Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) is an autosomal recessive disease featured by bilateral progressive stromal clouding and loss of vision, consequently necessitating corneal transplantation. Variants in <i>CHST6</i> gene have been recognized as the most critical genetic components in MCD. Although many <i>CHST6</i> variants have been described until now, the detailed mechanisms underlying MCD are still far from understood. In this study, we integrated all the reported <i>CHST6</i> variants described in 408 MCD cases, and performed a comprehensive evaluation to better illustrate the causality of these variants. The results showed that majority of these variants (165 out of 181) could be classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Interestingly, we also identified several disease causal variants with ethnic specificity. In addition, the results underscored the strong correlation between mutant frequency and residue conservation in the general population (Spearman's correlation coefficient = -0.311, <i>P</i> = 1.20E-05), thus providing potential candidate targets for further genetic manipulation. The current study highlighted the demand of further functional investigations to evaluate the causality of CHST6 variants, so as to promote earlier accurate diagnosis of MCD and future development of potential targets for genetic therapy."
30716510,gene therapy,"Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive muscle disorder caused by genetic mutations of the dystrophin encoding gene. In the absence of functional dystrophin, DMD patients suffer from muscle inflammation and wasting, as well as compromised bone health with increased risk of fracture. The use of high dose glucocorticoids (GC) as the standard therapy also contributes to bone fragility. This study examined the effects of intermittent, daily administered parathyroid hormone (iPTH), an approved bone anabolic therapy, on growing bone and dystrophic muscle in the presence and absence of prednisone treatment using the Mdx mouse model of DMD. Five-weeks of prednisone treatment in Mdx mice decreased cortical bone thickness and area (p < 0.001), with a large increase in endocortical osteoclasts that were significantly improved by PTH treatment (p < 0.001). GC-induced decreases in cortical bone toughness and modulus were improved with iPTH therapy (p < 0.05). Mdx mice showed significantly less bone mass in trabecular compartments of lumbar vertebrae and iPTH treatment, with or without glucocorticoids, significantly improved structural and material properties of this bone. Prednisone improved grip strength and endurance of treadmill running, which were maintained and further improved, respectively, in co-treated Mdx mice. Altogether, our study demonstrates that iPTH therapy significantly ameliorated GC-induced bone loss and maintained or further enhanced the positive effects of GCs on dystrophic muscle function. These findings give insight into the potential for use of teriparatide to treat growing bone in children with DMD."
30716471,gene therapy,"""Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP)"" is an umbrella term used to describe a group of rare genetic diseases also classified as ""Hereditary Sensory Autonomic Neuropathies (HSAN)"". These are intriguing conditions with potential to shed light on the poorly understood relationship concerning nociception and the experience of pain. However, the term CIP is epistemologically incorrect and is the product of historical circumstances. The term conflates pain and nociception and thus prevents researchers and caregivers from grasping the full dimensions of these conditions. The aims of this article are to review the epistemological problems surrounding the term, to demonstrate why the term is inaccurate and to suggest a new term: ""Congenital Nociceptor Deficiency"". The suggested term better reflects the nature of the conditions, and incorporates current understandings of nociception. Perspective: The umbrella term ""Congenital Insensitivity to Pain"" conflates pain and nociception, which is epistemologically unacceptable. We suggest a new term - Congenital Nociceptor Deficiency - that overcomes this problem and is concordant with current neurobiological knowledge."
30716454,gene therapy,"Bone Marrow (BM) is an essential hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source for many allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) recipients, including adult patients (for specific diseases and transplant strategies) and the majority of pediatric transplants. However, since the advent of Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC), there has been a significant decrease in utilization of BM in transplant patients, predominantly thought to be due to the increased logistical challenges around BM harvesting compared to PBSC, and generally no significant survival advantage of BM or PBSC. The decreased frequency of collection has the potential to impact the quality of BM harvests. In this study, we examined >15,000 BM donations collected at National Marrow Donor Program (NMDP) centers between 1994 and 2016, and revealed a significant decline in the quality of BM products (defined by concentration of total nucleated cells (TNC) - TNC/mL). TNC concentration dropped from 21.8 × 10<sup>6</sup>/mL in the earliest era (1994-1996) to 18.7 TNC x10<sup>6</sup>/mL in the most recent era (2012-2016) (Means Ratio 0.83, p<0.001). This decline in BM quality was seen despite selection of more donors perceived to be optimal (e.g. younger age and male). Multivariate regression analysis showed that higher volume centers, performing more than 30 collections per era, had better quality harvests with higher concentrations of TNC collected. In conclusion, we show a significant decrease in the quality of BM collections over time and lower volume collection centers had poorer quality harvests. In this analysis we could not elucidate the direct cause for this finding, suggesting that further studies investigating the key factors responsible, as well as exploring the impact on the transplant recipient, are required."
