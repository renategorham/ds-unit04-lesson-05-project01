30727020,orthopedics,"Newer generation cementless total knee arthroplasty (TKA) implants continue to develop with demonstrated clinical success in multiple recent reports. The purpose of this study was to investigate (1) survivorship, (2) complications, and (3) clinical outcomes of a newer generation cementless and highly porous titanium-coated base plate manufactured using three-dimensional (3D) printing technology. We reviewed a single-surgeon, longitudinally maintained database of patients who underwent primary TKA using cementless, highly porous titanium-coated base plate implants from July 1, 2013 to December 31, 2016. A total of 523 patients were identified. Of this cohort, 496 patients had a minimum of 2-year follow-up and were included in our final analysis. Among these patients, 72 had bilateral TKA yielding a total of 568 TKAs. There were 133 men and 363 women who had a mean body mass index of 33 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (range, 20-61 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The mean age was 66 years (range, 33-88 years). Average follow-up was 36 months (range, 24-48 months). Indications for TKA included osteoarthritis in 432 patients (87%), rheumatoid arthritis in 40 patients (8%), and knee osteonecrosis in 24 (5%) patients. Implant survivorship was defined as any revision leading to explantation of the base plate for any reason. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to determine all-cause implant survivorship at final follow-up for every patient. Complications were assessed using the Knee Society standardized list of TKA complications. Clinical outcomes were determined using the Knee Society pain and function scores. Range-of-motion values were also collected. There were a total of four failures, all were due to aseptic loosening with a survivorship rate of 99% at mean follow-up of 3 years (95% confidence interval = 0.984-0.999). In addition, there were a total of 12 surgical and 10 medical complications. Surgical complications did not affect the base plate or result in any additional implant revisions. A total of nine patients had thromboembolic disease complications; all received medical treatment and recovered adequately. Radiological evaluation did not show any signs of loosening or failures in other patients at final follow-up. Knee Society Scores for pain and function improved from 55 and 56 points preoperatively to 92 and 84 points at 2 years postoperatively. Our results are in concordance with the excellent clinical outcomes and survivorship demonstrated for the newer generation cementless TKA implants. In our experience, 3D printed titanium base plates demonstrated clinical success and excellent survivorship at minimum follow-up of 2 years."
30727016,orthopedics,"Revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a technically demanding enterprise. Management of widened or previously malpositioned tunnels is challenging and often requires innovative approaches. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the function and clinical results of revision single-stage ACL surgery using an anterolateral tibial tunnel (ALTT). A consecutive series of knees with arthroscopic ACL revision surgery were analyzed prospectively between April 2012 and September 2015. Among the 93 patients presented with revision ACL reconstruction, 25 patients met the study inclusion criteria for the ALTT technique and were followed up for a minimum of 2 years (range: 24-51 months). The clinical results were evaluated by means of the Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity level scale, and the knee stability was assessed by the Lachman test, pivot shift test, and anterior drawer test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the index knee before the surgery and 2 years after revision surgery was assessed. The mean IKDC subjective score, mean Tegner activity level scale, and mean Lysholm score significantly improved in all study participants. This study showed that ACL revision surgery with ALTT can reliably restore stability and provide fair functional outcomes in patients with ACL retear. One could expect acceptable lateral tibial tunnel length compared with medial tibial tunnel in classic ACL revision, intact bony surround, and good graft fixation. This technique is clinically relevant in that making an anterolateral tunnel in one-stage ACL revision surgery had a good subjective result with low complication rate in midterm follow-up."
30726717,orthopedics,"The pathophysiology of spinal cord injury (SCI) related processes of axonal degeneration and demyelination are poorly understood. The present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed such to establish quantitative results of animal studies regarding the role of injury severity, SCI models and level of injury on the pathophysiology of axon and myelin sheath degeneration. 39 related articles were included in the analysis. The compiled data showed that the total number of axons, number of myelinated axons, myelin sheath thickness, axonal conduction velocity, and internode length steadily decreased as time elapsed from the injury (P<sub>for trend</sub><0.0001). The rate of axonal retrograde degeneration was affected by SCI model and severity of the injury. Axonal degeneration was higher in injuries of the thoracic region. The SCI model and the site of the injury also affected axonal retrograde degeneration. The number of myelinated axons in the caudal region of the injury was significantly higher than the lesion site and the rostral region. The findings of the present meta-analysis show that the pathophysiology of axons and myelin sheath differ in various phases of SCI and are affected by multiple factors related to the injury."

In this study, we examined the functional role of SNHG16 in OS cells through knocked-down SNHG16 by using siRNA. We found that SNHG16 is overexpressed in OS tissues and cell lines. Inhibition of SNHG16 reduced OS cells proliferation, stimulated apoptosis, and decreased migration and invasion. In addition, SNHG16 reduced miR-340 expression in OS cells. The results showed that SNHG16 involves in the migration and invasion of OS cells through sponging miRNA-340. Together, our data support an important role of SNHG16 in regulating OS cell invasion and migration that highlights SNHG16 may be regarded as a potential target for OS treatment."

30724791,orthopedics,"Gait variability is often associated with reduced coordination and increased instability during walking. Especially for patients with musculoskeletal conditions, variability in gait might be associated with the level of daily activity. Therefore, this study examines kinematic variability during walking and the association with daily activity in patients with transfemoral amputation. Therefore, 15 transfemoral amputees, using the C-leg prosthesis of Otto Bock, between 18 and 65 years were recruited during their hospital stay. All patients were able to walk without crutches in everyday life and were familiar with walking using the C-leg system. Gait parameters and data of variability were captured during walking in a gait laboratory by eight infrared cameras (Vicon). Daily activity was assessed using a three-dimensional acceleration sensor of VitaMove. Patients showed variability from 0.84° up to 1.96° in frontal pelvis motion and from 0.9° up to 4.02° in trunk obliquity. The results show a significant correlation between activity and variability in trunk (r=-0.58; P≤0.05) and pelvis (r=-0.63; P ≤0.01) as well as gait velocity (r=0.6; P≤0.05). However, kinematic variability and gait velocity are not related to each other. In conclusion, the results show that kinematic gait variability is associated with the extent of activity and therefore presents an important parameter for assessing amputees' gait quality and daily activity."
30724479,orthopedics,"In this study, a novel 3D printed porous titanium Cage (3D printed Cage) with interconnected pores inside was designed and manufactured. Observations by scanning electron microscopy showed that the inside of the 3D printed Cage had an octahedral porous structure, with the pores uniform in size and connected to each other. The mechanical properties test found that the Young's modulus and compressive strength of the porous structure were close to those of the bone structure, and the overall stiffness was slightly higher than that of the PEEK material, but was significantly lower than that of the titanium alloy solid module. Animal experiments indicated that the new 3D printed Cage was equivalent to PEEK Cage in fusion time. At 3 months, the new bone grew into the cage through the pores of the new 3D printed Cage surface, which had a high bone contact rate. These results demonstrate that the 3D printed porous titanium Cage has good biocompatibility and osseointegration, and has a potential clinical value as bone implants.

Substantial studies have revealed various underlying mechanisms of MDR in cancers. As for osteosarcoma, evidence has highlighted that microRNAs (miRNAs) can mediate in the processes of DNA damage response, apoptosis avoidance, autophagy induction, activation of cancer stem cells, and signal transduction. Besides, these drug resistance-related miRNAs showed much promise for serving as candidates for predictive biomarkers of poor outcomes and shorter survival time, and therapeutic targets to reverse drug resistance and overcome treatment refractoriness. This review aims to demonstrate the potential molecular mechanisms of miRNAs-regulated drug resistance in osteosarcoma, and provide insight in translating basic evidence into therapeutic strategies."

The main aim of our study was to evaluate the effects on endothelial function, lipid profile, and glucose metabolism of two different combinations of nutraceuticals, first one containing Bergavit (200 mg Citrus bergamia), Omega-3 (400 mg), Crominex 3+ (10 mcg trivalent chromium), and red yeast rice (100 mg; 5 mg monacolin K) and second one containing red yeast rice (200 mg; 3 mg monacolin K), Berberine (500 mg), Astaxanthin (0.5 mg), folic acid (200 mcg), Coenzyme Q10 (2 mg), and Policosanol (10 mg). Fifty subjects affected by dyslipidemia not requiring statin treatment were enrolled in this randomized, blind, controlled trial and submitted to blood sampling for lipid and glucose profiles and instrumental evaluation of endothelial function before and after 6 weeks of treatment with nutraceuticals. Both nutraceutical combinations improved the lipid profile; the nutraceutical containing 5 mg of monacolin K, 200 mg of the extract <i>Citrus bergamia</i>, 400 mg of Omega-3, and 10 mcg of trivalent chromium entailed a significant improvement of endothelial function with enhanced cholesterol lowering effect.

30723676,orthopedics,"Orthopaedic implants are applied daily in our orthopaedic clinics for treatment of musculoskeletal injuries, especially for bone fracture fixation. To realise the multiple functions of orthopaedic implants, hybrid system that contains several different materials or parts have also been designed for application, such as prosthesis for total hip arthroplasty. Fixation of osteoporotic fracture is challenging as the current metal implants made of stainless steel or titanium that are rather rigid and bioinert, which are not favourable for enhancing fracture healing and subsequent remodelling. Magnesium (Mg) and its alloys are reported to possess good biocompatibility, biodegradability and osteopromotive effects during its <i>in vivo</i> degradation and now tested as a new generation of degradable metallic biomaterials. Several recent clinical studies reported the Mg-based screws for bone fixation, although the history of testing Mg as fixation implant was documented more than 100 years ago. Truthfully, Mg has its limitations as fixation implant, especially when applied at load-bearing sites because of rather rapid degradation. Currently developed Mg-based implants have only been designed for application at less or non-loading-bearing skeletal site(s). Therefore, after years research and development, the authors propose an innovative hybrid fixation system with parts composed of Mg and titanium or stainless steel to maximise the biological benefits of Mg; titanium or stainless steel in this hybrid system can provide enough mechanical support for fractures at load-bearing site(s) while Mg promotes the fracture healing through novel mechanisms during its degradation, especially in patients with osteoporosis and other metabolic disorders that are unfavourable conditions for fracture healing. This hybrid fixation strategy is designed to effectively enhance the osteoporotic fracture healing and may potentially also reduce the refracture rate. <b>The translational potential of this article</b>: This article systemically reviewed the combination utility of different metallic implants in orthopaedic applications. It will do great contribution to the further development of internal orthopaedic implants for fracture fixation. Meanwhile, it also introduced a titanium-magnesium hybrid fixation system as an alternative fixation strategy, especially for osteoporotic patients."

Intra-articular distal end radius fractures are recognized as very complex injuries with a variable prognosis. The aim of the study was to assess the long-term functional outcome of patients treated with Joshi's external stabilizing system (JESS) for displaced intra-articular distal end radius fractures. <b>Materials and Methods</b>  A total of 170 patients with intra-articular distal end radius fracture were treated with JESS from 2014 to 2017. The patients were followed up at 2, 6 weeks, 6 months, 1, and 2 years (final) after the surgery. The assessment of pain, range of motion, grip strength, and satisfaction were assessed at 6 months, 1, and 2 years (final) follow-up and scored according to modified Mayo wrist scoring system. <b>Results</b>  The good and/or excellent results were found in 82.2% of cases. We observed that patients with age less than 50 years had greater prognosis as compared with patients with more than 50 years of age. Final outcome was also found better in males as compared with females at 6 months, 1, and 2 years postoperatively. <b>Conclusion</b>  JESS is an effective treatment technique for intra-articular distal end radius fractures in our community. On long-term follow-up of the patients treated with JESS for intra-articular distal end radius fractures, the functional and radiological outcomes were good with low complication rate."
30723596,orthopedics,"<b>Background</b>  The effects of dorsal angulation deformity on in vitro distal radioulnar joint (DRUJ) contact patterns are not well understood. <b>Purpose</b>  The purpose of this study was to utilize intercartilage distance to examine the effects of forearm rotation angle, distal radius deformity, and triangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) sectioning on DRUJ contact area and centroid position. <b>Methods</b>  An adjustable implant permitted the creation of simulated intact state and dorsal angulation deformities of 10, 20, and 30 degrees. Three-dimensional cartilage models of the distal radius and ulna were created using computed tomography data. Using optically tracked motion data, the relative position of the cartilage models was rendered and used to measure DRUJ cartilage contact mechanics. <b>Results</b>  DRUJ contact area was highest between 10 and 30 degrees of supination. TFCC sectioning caused a significant decrease in contact area with a mean reduction of 11 ± 7 mm <sup>2</sup> between the TFCC intact and sectioned conditions across all variables. The position of the contact centroid moved volarly and proximally with supination for all variables. Deformity had a significant effect on the location of the contact centroid along the volar-dorsal plane. <b>Conclusion</b>  Contact area in the DRUJ was maximal between 10 and 30 degrees of supination during the conditions tested. There was a significant effect of simulated TFCC rupture on contact area in the DRUJ, with a mean contact reduction of 11 ± 7 mm <sup>2</sup> after sectioning. Increasing dorsal angulation caused the contact centroid to move progressively more volar in the sigmoid notch."

30721745,orthopedics,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in cancer development. Several studies have indicated that miRNAs mediate tumorigenesis processes, such as inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis and invasion. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of the microRNA-185 (miR-185) on the proliferation, migration and invasion of osteosarcoma (OS). MiR-185 expression was reduced in OS tissues and OS cell lines. MiR-185 inhibited OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, a dual-luciferase assay validated that vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP2) was a direct target of miR-185. Overexpression of miR-185 in OC cells reduced VAMP2 expression in protein and mRNA levels, whereas suppression of miR-185 led to an increase in VAMP2 protein and mRNA levels. In addition, we found that VAMP2 silencing inhibited the OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Further studies verified that introducing VAMP2 mRNA into cells over-expressing miR-185 abrogated the effects of miR-185 on OS cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Therefore, these results confirm that decreased expression of miR-185 might be regarded as a tumor marker for the early diagnosis of OS, by manipulating of its interactive factors with VAMP2, to provide an effective novel therapeutic target for treatment of the OS tumor."
30721671,orthopedics,"Osteoporosis is a chronic bone lytic disease, because of inadequate bone ossification and/or excessive bone resorption. Even though drugs are currently available for the treatment of osteoporosis, there remains an unmet need for the development of more specific novel agents with less adverse effects. Dehydrocostus lactone (DHC), a natural sesquiterpene lactone, was previously found to affect the differentiation of inflammatory cells by the inhibiting NF-κB pathways, and garnered much interest for its anti-cancer properties via SOCS-mediated cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. As NF-κB pathway plays an essential role in osteoclast differentiation, we sought to discover the biological effects of DHC on osteoclast differentiation and resorptive activity, as well as the underlying mechanisms on these effects. Our research found that DHC inhibited RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation, bone resorption and osteoclast specific genes expression via suppression of NF-κB and NFAT signaling pathways in vitro. We further demonstrated that DHC protected against ovariectomy (OVX)-induced osteoprosis in the mouse model and the protective effects may be mediated through the attenuation of NF-κB signaling pathway. Thus, this study provides insight that DHC might be used as a potential pharmacological treatment for osteoporosis."

30720911,orthopedics,"Tendon healing follows a complex series of coordinated events that ultimately produces a mechanically inferior tissue more scar-like than native tendon. More regenerative healing occurs when anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages play a more dominant role. Mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSCs) are able to polarize macrophages to an M2 immunophenotype via paracrine mechanisms. We previously reported that co-culture of CD14+ macrophages (MQs) with MSCs resulted in a unique M2-like macrophage. More recently, we generated M2-like macrophages using only extracellular vesicles (EVs) isolated from MSCs creating ""EV-educated macrophages"" (also called exosome-educated macrophages, EEMs), thereby foregoing direct use of MSCs. For the current study, we hypothesized that cell therapy with EEMs would improve in vivo tendon healing by modulating tissue inflammation and endogenous macrophage immunophenotypes. We evaluated effects of EEMs using a mouse Achilles tendon rupture model and compared results to normal tendon healing (without any biologic intervention), MSCs, MQs, or EVs. We found that exogenous administration of EEMs directly into the wound promoted a healing response that was significantly more functional and more regenerative. Injured tendons treated with exogenous EEMs exhibited 1) improved mechanical properties, 2) reduced inflammation, and 5) earlier angiogenesis. Treatment with MSC-derived EVs alone were less effective functionally but stimulated a biological response as evidenced by an increased number of endothelial cells and decreased M1/M2 ratio. Because of their regenerative and immunomodulatory effects, EEM treament could provide a novel strategy to promote wound healing in this and various other musculo-skeletal injuries or pathologies where inflammation and inadequate healing is problematic. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Tendon healing results in a mechanically inferior tissue more scar-like than native tendon. To improve healing outcome, M2-like macrophages were generated by exposing CD14+ macrophages to extracellular vesicles (EVs), creating ""EV-educated macrophages"" (EEMs). EEM treatment to a tendon injury accelerated biological and functional healing. These results have significant clinical relevance in that 1) EEMs are terminally differentiated and will not proliferate or differentiate into undesirable cell types in vivo, 2) EEMs can be generated using off-the-shelf EVs, and monocytes collected from a patient's own blood, and 3) the immune-modulatory effects of EEMs suggest this approach may benefit other inflammatory conditions. © AlphaMed Press 2019."

30720133,orthopedics,"The development of cervical cancer (CC) is a multi‑gene, multi‑step carcinogenic process that involves complex genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. SRY‑related HMG‑box gene 11 (SOX11) is a member of the SOX family of transcription factors with an emerging crucial role in the development of various tumor types. To elucidate the function of SOX11 in cervical carcinogenesis, the expression level of SOX11 during the development of human CC was analyzed by immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Additionally, the methylation status of the SOX11 was examined using bisulfite sequencing and methylation‑specific polymerase chain reaction. The SOX11 expression and promoter methylation in human CC cell lines were also determined. The effect of SOX11 expression restoration after 5‑aza‑2'‑deoxycytidine (5‑Aza‑dC) treatment on the CC cell proliferation ability was evaluated in CC cell lines. SOX11 was highly expressed in normal cervix (NC) and precancerous low‑grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, but weakly expressed or virtually absent in precancerous high‑grade squamous intraepithelial lesions and CC, which is consistent with the result of the western blot analysis. Hypermethylation of the SOX11 promoter was detected in CC, which was significantly higher than that in NC samples at each CpG site. The expression level of SOX11 in the CC cell lines was downregulated compared with the positive control, Tera‑1human teratoma cell line. Upon 5‑Aza‑dC treatment, SOX11 expression was significantly upregulated in the CC cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels, and cell proliferation was inhibited. The results indicated that the downregulation of SOX11 in CC is due to the hypermethylation of the SOX11 promoter region. Thus, SOX11 methylation may have a role in the growth of CC cells and cervical carcinogenesis."
30720124,orthopedics,"The overall survival rate of patients with osteosarcoma has remained unchanged for the last several decades. Therefore, novel drugs for osteosarcoma treatment are required. Isoliquiritigenin (ISL), a natural compound, has been demonstrated to inhibit the growth of various tumors. However, it is unclear whether ISL is able to inhibit the growth of osteosarcoma. In the present study, it was identified that ISL was able to inhibit the growth of the osteosarcoma cell line Saos‑2 cells in vitro and in xenograft tumors primarily by attenuating tumor cell proliferation and, cell migration and promoting tumor cell apoptosis. Decreased tumor cell proliferation induced by ISL was associated with downregulation of cyclin D1 and upregulation of p53, p21 and p27. Increased tumor cell apoptosis triggered by ISL was associated with downregulation of apoptosis regulator Bcl‑2, upregulation of apoptosis regulator Bax and damaged mitochondrial function evidenced by a low level of ATP‑synthesis. In addition, ISL was able to inhibit the migratory capacity of Saos‑2 cells by modulating the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and MMP9. Mechanistic analysis revealed that the tumor growth‑inhibitory effect of ISL may depend on the action of ISL on the phosphorylation of PI3K and AKT. However, it remains to be investigated whether the inhibitory effect of ISL on the migration of Saos‑2 cells was associated with downregulated PI3K/AKT signaling. Overall, the present study provided evidence for the potential use of ISL against osteosarcoma."
30720099,orthopedics,"10‑Hydroxycamptothecin (HCPT) effectively controls epidural fibrosis, but the exact underlying mechanisms remain ambiguous. Abnormal microRNA (miR)‑23b‑3p expression has been detected in various types of fibrotic tissues that are present in different diseases. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms through which HCPT induces fibroblast apoptosis. Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reactions were performed on six traumatic scar samples and matched normal skin samples; traumatic scar formation was revealed to be significantly inversely associated with miR‑23b‑3p expression. In addition, the miR‑23b‑3p expression level in human fibroblasts was examined following HCPT treatment. The effects of HCPT and miR‑23b‑3p on fibroblast apoptosis were assessed using terminal deoxynucleotidyl‑transferase‑mediated dUTP nick‑end labeling, flow cytometry and western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that HCPT treatment notably increased miR‑23b‑3p expression levels and accelerated fibroblast apoptosis. Therefore, upregulation of miR‑23b‑3p expression was demonstrated to promote fibroblast apoptosis, consistently with the effects of HCPT. The results of the present study indicated that HCPT may induce fibroblast apoptosis by regulating miR‑23b‑3p expression."
30720093,orthopedics,"Recent studies have suggested that puerarin may impede osteoclastogenesis and facilitate bone regeneration, in addition to attenuating tissue inflammation. The present study investigated the therapeutic effects of puerarin on inflammatory responses and monocyte recruitment in in vitro and in vivo osteoarthritis (OA) models. Puerarin treatment increased the proliferation of OA chondrocytes, as determined by Cell Counting Kit‑8 assay. In addition, the present results suggested that puerarin suppressed the interleukin‑1β‑induced production of inflammatory cytokines in OA chondrocytes and monocytes/macrophages, as assessed by ELISA. In a mouse model of mono‑iodoacetate‑induced OA, the present histological analyses suggested that administration with puerarin attenuated the inflammatory profile of OA joints and reduced cartilage destruction. Using flow cytometry, a decreased number of myeloid‑derived C‑C chemokine receptor 2+/lymphocyte Ag 6C+ monocytes was identified in the blood of OA mice treated with puerarin compared with control OA mice. Furthermore, quantitative real‑time polymerase chain reaction analysis suggested that puerarin treatment decreased C‑C chemokine ligand 2 expression in arthritic tissues. Collectively, the results suggested that puerarin treatment limited the recruitment of inflammatory monocytes. In summary, the present study provided pre‑clinical evidence that puerarin may serve as a potential target in the treatment of OA."
30720085,orthopedics,"Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common primary bone malignancy. It predominantly occurs in adolescents, but can develop at any age. The age at diagnosis is a prognostic factor of OS, but the molecular basis of this remains unknown. The current study aimed to identify age‑induced differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and potential molecular mechanisms that contribute to the different outcomes of patients with OS. Microarray data (GSE39058 and GSE39040) obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and used to analyze age‑induced DEGs to reveal molecular mechanism of OS among different age groups (<20 and >20 years old). Differentially expressed mRNAs (DEMs) were divided into up and downregulated DEMs (according to the expression fold change), then Gene Ontology function enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis were performed. Furthermore, the interactions among proteins encoded by DEMs were integrated with prediction for microRNA‑mRNA interactions to construct a regulatory network. The key subnetwork was extracted and Kaplan‑Meier survival analysis for a key microRNA was performed. DEMs within the subnetwork were predominantly involved in 'ubiquitin protein ligase binding', 'response to growth factor', 'regulation of type I interferon production', 'response to decreased oxygen levels', 'voltage‑gated potassium channel complex', 'synapse part', 'regulation of stem cell proliferation'. In summary, integrated bioinformatics was applied to analyze the potential molecular mechanisms leading to different outcomes of patients with OS among different age groups. The hub genes within the key subnetwork may have crucial roles in the different outcomes associated with age and require further analysis."
30720072,orthopedics,"Spinal cord injury (SCI) induces aberrant expression of microRNAs (miRNAs), causing various secondary injury responses, including inflammation, apoptosis and oxidative stress. However, the mechanisms underlying miRNA‑mediated apoptosis have not been fully elucidated. In the present study, a rat SCI model was established and a miRNA microarray was analyzed to detect miRNA expression profiles at different times post‑SCI. The Basso, Beattie and Bresnahan score, cresyl violet staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl‑-transferase‑mediated dUTP nick end labeling staining were used to evaluate locomotor activity, lesion volume and neuronal cell apoptosis, respectively, at different time points post‑SCI. It was observed that numerous miRNAs were altered at 14 days post‑SCI and miR‑124 was one of the most notably downregulated miRNAs. The present results demonstrated that overexpression of miR‑124 by agomir‑124 improves functional recovery, decreases lesion size and suppresses neuronal cell apoptosis in a rat SCI model. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that miR‑124 inhibited apoptosis regulator BAX (Bax) expression, a key molecule in the activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, by targeting its 3'‑untranslated region in BV‑2 cells. Furthermore, restoration of Bax by pc‑DNA‑Bax inhibits the protective effect of miR‑124 in H2O2‑treated BV‑2 cells. Notably, the present results demonstrated that miR‑124 may block the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by inhibiting Bax, cleaved‑caspase‑9 and cleaved‑caspase‑3 expression in rats following SCI. Collectively, the present results suggested that miR‑124 may improve functional recovery and supress neuronal cell apoptosis by blocking the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in SCI rats, suggesting that miR‑124 may serve as a potential therapeutic target in SCI treatment."
30720070,orthopedics,"The multipotent and easily accessible characteristics of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) make them a promising target for bone tissue engineering. Long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have an important role in the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Nevertheless, whether lncRNAs are involved in the osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs remains unclear. The present study examined the expression alterations of lncRNAs in tumor necrosis factor‑α induced osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs. Following identification of differentially expressed lncRNAs at different time points by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction, profiling analysis was performed and a profile was further validated, in which lncRNA expression levels demonstrated significant upregulation. The next generation sequencing analysis identified 77 (58 upregulated and 19 downregulated) and 133 differentially expressed lncRNAs (73 upregulated and 60 downregulated) at 7 and 14 days post‑treatment, respectively. In addition, 34 lncRNAs were predicted to be strongly associated with 336 mRNA transcripts that underwent significant alterations during osteogenic differentiation. The present data demonstrated that one lncRNA, X inactive specific transcript, is essential for efficient osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs by alkaline phosphatase staining. In summary, the present findings provide insight for the understanding of how non‑coding RNAs are involved in regulating the osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs, which may further advance the translational studies of bone tissue engineering."
30719683,orthopedics,"Athletes who wish to resume high-level activities after an injury to the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) are often advised to undergo surgical reconstruction. Nevertheless, ACL reconstruction (ACLR) does not equate to normal function of the knee or reduced risk of subsequent injuries. In fact, recent evidence has shown that only around half of post-ACLR patients can expect to return to competitive level of sports. A rising concern is the high rate of second ACL injuries, particularly in young athletes, with up to 20% of those returning to sport in the first year from surgery experiencing a second ACL rupture. Aside from the increased risk of second injury, patients after ACLR have an increased risk of developing early onset of osteoarthritis. Given the recent findings, it is imperative that rehabilitation after ACLR is scrutinized so the second injury preventative strategies can be optimized. Unfortunately, current ACLR rehabilitation programs may not be optimally effective in addressing deficits related to the initial injury and the subsequent surgical intervention. Motor learning to (re-)acquire motor skills and neuroplastic capacities are not sufficiently incorporated during traditional rehabilitation, attesting to the high re-injury rates. The purpose of this article is to present novel clinically integrated motor learning principles to support neuroplasticity that can improve patient functional performance and reduce the risk of second ACL injury. The following key concepts to enhance rehabilitation and prepare the patient for re-integration to sports after an ACL injury that is as safe as possible are presented: (1) external focus of attention, (2) implicit learning, (3) differential learning, (4) self-controlled learning and contextual interference. The novel motor learning principles presented in this manuscript may optimize future rehabilitation programs to reduce second ACL injury risk and early development of osteoarthritis by targeting changes in neural networks."

However, the prognostic and clinicopathological value of miR-155 remains unclear. Here, we performed this systemic review and meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate the prognostic and clinicopathological significance of miR-155 expression in hematologic malignancies. <b>Methods:</b> We systematically searched the PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane library databases and OVID to identify eligible studies published from Jan 1, 2008 to Aug 1, 2018. The pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to detect the prognostic and clinicopathological role of miR-155 in hematologic malignancies. <b>Results:</b> A total of 18 studies including 2316 patients were enrolled in the present meta-analysis, indicating significant association between elevated miR-155 expression and poor overall survival (OS) in 2114 patients (pooled HR = 1.72, 95%CI [1.50-1.97], p<0.001). Elevated miR-155 expression level was related to shorter event free survival (EFS, pooled HR = 1.55, 95%CI [0.94-2.57], P=0.002), disease free survival (DFS, pooled HR = 1.38, 95%CI [1.13-1.68], P=0.001), progress free survival (PFS, pooled HR = 1.58, 95%CI [1.06-2.35], p<0.001) and treatment free survival (TFS, pooled HR = 1.67, 95%CI [1.16-2.39], P=0.006). Additionally, overexpression of miR-155 was found to be significantly related to FLT3/ITD presence (OR=4.751, 95%CI [3.229-6.990], P<0.001), more WT1 mutation (OR=2.090, 95%CI [1.240-3.522], P=0.006) and less CEBPA mutation (OR=0.477, 95%CI [0.286-0.794], P=0.004) in 552 AML patients. <b>Conclusion:</b> MiR-155 expression was found to be associated with several leukemia-related phenotype and poor prognosis in hematologic malignancies. Therefore, miR-155 overexpression might be a convinced unfavorable prognostic indicator that helps the clinical decision-making process."
30719118,orthopedics,"Previous studies have revealed that elevated expression of high mobility group A2 (HMGA2) is closely associated with the occurrence of pituitary adenomas (PAs). The expression of microRNA (miR)-16 is deregulated in PA tissues. Bioinformatics analysis has demonstrated that there is a complementary region between seed region of miR-16 and 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of HMGA2 gene. In the present study, it was investigated whether miR-16 may regulate the expression of HMGA2 and whether it is involved in the pathogenesis of PAs. A total of 52 patients with PAs were recruited. Normal brain tissues obtained from 12 patients with traumatic brain injury were used as controls. The association between miR-16 and HMGA2 was validated using dual-luciferase reporter gene assay. HP75 cells were cultured <i>in vitro</i> and divided into the following groups: miR control, miR-16 mimic, small interfering RNA (si)-negative control, si-HMGA2 and miR-16 mimic+si-HMGA2 groups. The expression of miR-16 and HMGA2 in HP75 cells was determined using qRT-PCR and western blot. Cell proliferation was detected using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and apoptosis was detected using the TdT-UTP nick end labeling assay. Compared with normal pituitary tissues, the expression of miR-16 in PA tissues was significantly decreased, while the mRNA and protein levels of HMGA2 were significantly increased. miR-16 targeted the 3'-UTR of HMGA2 gene and regulated the expression of HMGA2. Transfection with siRNAs targeting HMGA2 and/or miR-16 mimics inhibited the expression of HMGA2 and the proliferative ability of HP75 cells, whereas it increased apoptosis of HP75 cells. The downregulation of miR-16 and upregulation of HMGA2 were involved in the pathogenesis of PAs. Thus, it is hypothesized that miR-16 inhibited the proliferation and promoted apoptosis of HP75 cells by inhibiting HMGA2 expression."
30719110,orthopedics,"Effective therapies are limited for pancreatic cancer, particularly for those with distant tumour metastases. Therefore, more individualised drug screening is urgently required. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a powerful tool to investigate the genomic landscape of patients and the mechanism of drug response, which may provide a broader vision for potential clinical drug screening. Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models may have a significant advantage in predicting clinical treatment response. In our previous study, a PDX of pancreatic cancer bone metastasis was established, and NGS was conducted to investigate the molecular information. In the present study, these data were further analysed and fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) amplification was identified in a panel of 416 cancer-associated genes. Thus, AZD4547, an inhibitor against FGFR, was selected as a potential therapy, and was evaluated using the PDX model. AZD4547 was shown to exhibit antitumor activity by reducing the expression of FGFR1 and its targets. The present study also demonstrated the high potential of the novel NGS/PDX-based drug screening platform to improve individualised cancer treatment."

30718736,orthopedics,"Contact dermatitis and psoriasis are skin disorders caused by immune dysregulation, yet much remains unknown about their underlying mechanisms. Ghrelin, a recently discovered novel peptide and potential endogenous anti-inflammatory factor expressed in the epidermis, is involved in skin repair and disease. In this study, we investigated the expression pattern and therapeutic effect of ghrelin in both contact dermatitis and psoriasis mouse models induced by oxazolone (OXA) and imiquimod (IMQ), respectively, and in TNF-α-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages, NHEKs and skin fibroblasts. Ghrelin expression was reduced in both the OXA-induced contact dermatitis and IMQ-induced psoriasis mouse models. Furthermore, treatment with ghrelin attenuated skin inflammation in both the contact dermatitis and psoriasis mouse models. Mice administered PBS after OXA- or IMQ-induced model generation exhibited typical skin inflammation, whereas ghrelin treatment in these mouse models substantially decreased the dermatitis phenotype. In addition, exogenous ghrelin attenuated the inflammatory reaction induced by TNF-α in RAW264.7 cells. Moreover, ghrelin administration limited activation of NF-κB signaling. In summary, ghrelin may represent a potential molecular target for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, including contact dermatitis and psoriasis."
30718466,orthopedics,"Heat stroke has increased in frequency worldwide in recent years and continues to have a high morbidity and mortality. Identification of the mechanisms mediating heat stoke is important and necessary. Our preliminary study revealed heat stress (HS)-induced apoptosis of vascular endothelial cells was associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced p53 translocation into mitochondria. Previous studies have suggested the prolyl-isomerase Pin1 regulates p53 functioning through specific binding to p53 phosphorylation sites. Based on these studies, we presumed Pin1 is a key intermediate in regulation of mitochondrial p53 translocation through a HS-induced ROS-p53 transcription-independent apoptosis pathway. In this context, we revealed p53 had a crucial role in a HS-induced mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, where p53 protein rapidly translocated into mitochondria in endothelial cells both in vitro and in vivo. In particular, HS caused an increase in p53 phosphorylation at Ser46 that facilitated interactions with phosphorylation-dependent prolyl-isomerase Pin1, which has a key role in promoting HS-induced localization of p53 to mitochondria. Furthermore, we also found ROS production was a critical mediator in HS-induced Pin1/p53 signaling and was involved in regulating mitochondrial apoptosis pathway activation. Therefore, we have contributed to our profound understanding of the mechanism underlying HS-induced endothelial dysfunction in an effort to reduce the mortality and morbidity of heat stroke."

Biochemical properties of nanoparticles (NPs) are depend in its medium dispersed. Biochemical properties could effectively alter the therapeutic potential of NPs. Phytochemicals could serve as suitable medium for dispersion of NPs. P-Coumaric acid (CA) known to have anti-inflammatory activity. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the present experiment, we investigated the anti-inflammatory effect of SeNPs dispersed in 1% CA against Complete Freund's adjuvant induced RA. Celecoxib was used as a reference drug. RESULTS Selenium NPs (SeNPs) size is maintained in 1% CA solution. We observed that supplementation with 500 μg/Kg body weight (b.w.) eNPs significantly restored the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, COX-2 activity, different antioxidant enzyme activities, and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and MCP-1) in RA rats. The mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes such as MnSOD, Cu/ZnSOD, ECSOD, CAT, and GPx1 was found to be downregulated, whereas COX-2 was upregulated in RA rats; however, the mRNA expression of CAT, GPx1, and COX-2 reverted back to near normal levels in SeNPs-treated animals. CONCLUSIONS The therapeutic potential of SeNPs was confirmed through histological observation of angle joints in different experimental animals. Our results collectively suggest that SeNPs dispersed in CA can be an effective therapeutic agent for inflammatory disorders like acute gouty arthritis."

Therefore, the current study analyzed the effect of a dynamic hallux valgus splint. Methods Seventy patients were included in this prospective randomized trial. Patients with a hallux valgus were treated using a dynamic splint or underwent no treatment. Clinical and radiological parameters were evaluated. Results We found no significant changes in hallux valgus angle, intermetatarsal I-II angle, AOFAS score, FAOS or SF-36 score between the groups. However, a significant between-group difference was found for pain during walking and running and in the FAOS subscale for pain and pain at rest at follow-up. Conclusions Wearing a dynamic hallux valgus splint does provide some pain relief in patients with a symptomatic hallux valgus, but showed no effect on hallux valgus position. Level of evidence: 1."

30717817,orthopedics,"Tumor specific Th9 cells are potential effector cells for adoptive therapy of human cancers. TNF family members OX40L, TL1A and GITRL have been shown to promote the induction of Th9 cells and antitumor immunity. However, the role of TNF-α, the prototype of the TNF superfamily cytokines, in Th9 cell differentiation and their antitumor efficacy is not defined. Here, we showed that TNF-α potently promoted naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to differentiate into Th9 cells in vitro. Furthermore, the addition of TNF-α during Th9 cell differentiation increased T cell survival and proliferation. More importantly, the adoptive transfer of TNF-α-treated Th9 cells induced more potent antitumor effects than regular Th9 cells in mouse tumor model. TNF-α signals via two cell surface receptors, TNFR1 and TNFR2. Mechanistic studies revealed that TNF-α drove Th9 cell differentiation through TNFR2 but not TNFR1. In addition, under Th9 polarizing condition, TNF-α activated STAT5 and NF-κB pathways in T cells in a TNFR2-dependent manner. Inhibition of STAT5 and NF-κB pathways by their specific inhibitors impaired TNF-α-induced Th9 cell differentiation. Our results identified TNF-α as a new powerful inducer of Th9 cells and clarified the molecular mechanisms underlying TNF-α-induced Th9 cell differentiation."

30717484,orthopedics,"The goal of the study is to understand how the curing characteristics of a human bone cement (HBC) and veterinary bone cement (VBC) influence the mechanical behavior of each cement and cement bonding with an implant. This study hypothesizes that the curing temperature and time influence the mechanical properties of the cement adjacent to the implant, which resulted in the variability in bonding strength between the implant and cement. To test this hypothesis, this study measured the exothermic temperature, flexural strength, hardness, and morphology of a HBC and VBC at different curing times. In addition, this study measured shear strength at the interfaces of implant/HBC and implant/VBC samples during static and stepwise cyclic tests at different curing times. This study used Stryker Simplex P and BioMedtrix 3 poly methyl methacrylate (PMMA) as an HBC and VBC, respectively. This study cured HBC and VBC cement for 30 and 60 min and then conducted flexural, hardness, and interface fracture tests to evaluate the curing effect on mechanical behavior of each of the cements. This study found that the curing time significantly increases the values of flexure and hardness properties of each cement and shear strength of implant/HBC and implant/VBC (<i>p</i> < 0.05). This study observed a difference of curing time and temperature between HBC and VBC. This study also observed a significant difference of surface porosity at the interface of implant/HBC and implant/VBC interfaces. The variability of mechanical properties between HBC and VBC due to the differences of curing conditions may influence the bonding of cement with the implant."

30716122,orthopedics,"The majority of compressive vertebral fractures in osteoporotic bone occur at the level of the thoracolumbar junction. Immediate decompression is often required in order to reduce the extent of neurological damage. This study evaluated four fixation methods for decompression in patients with thoracolumbar burst fractures, and presented the most suitable method for osteoporotic patients. A finite element model of a T7-L5 spinal segment was created and subjected to an L1 corpectomy to simulate a serious burst fracture. Five models were tested: a) intact spine; 2) two segment fixation (TSF), 3) up-three segment fixation (UTSF), below-three segment fixation (BTSF), and four segment fixation (FSF). The ROM, stiffness and compression ratio of the fractured vertebra were recorded under various loading conditions. The results of this study showed that the ROM of the FSF model was the lowest, and the ROMs of UTSF and BTSF models were similar but still greater than the TSF model. Decreasing the BMD to simulate osteoporotic bone resulted in a ROM for the four instrumented models that was higher than the normal bone model. Of all models, the FSF model had the highest stiffness at T12-L2 in extension and lateral bending. Similarly, the compression ratio of the FSF model at L1 was also higher than the other instrumented models. In conclusion, FSF fixation is suggested for patients with osteoporotic thoracolumbar burst fractures. For patients with normal bone quality, both UTSF and BTSF fixation provide an acceptable stiffness in extension and lateral bending, as well as a favorable compression ratio at L1."
30716059,orthopedics,"BACKGROUND The expression and mechanism of IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, BMP, FGF1, and IGF-1 in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with lumbar disc herniation were investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS Immunohistochemical methods were applied to identify IL-1, IL-2, IL-8, BMP, FGF1, and IGF-1. PI3K, AKT protein, and mRNA expression were detected and analyzed by Western blot analysis. We selected 30 healthy SD rats and divided them into 2 groups to construct an animal model that was validated by immediate CT scanning. Cartilage tissues from the lumbar disc herniation (experimental) group and control group were obtained and compared. RESULTS The expression of BMP was not significantly different between the control group and the experimental group (P>0.05). FGF1: There was no significant difference in the expression of FGF1 (P>0.05) between the control group and the experimental group. Compared with the control group, the expression of IGF-1 in the experimental group was significantly higher (P<0.05); the expression of IL-1 in the experimental group was significantly higher (P<0.05); and the expression of IL-2 in the experimental group was also significantly higher (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in IL-8 between the experimental group and the control group (P>0.05). The expression levels of PI3K and AKT protein and mRNA were significantly higher than those in healthy controls (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS After lumbar disc herniation occurred, the IGF-1 was first activated; the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was later activated, which resulted in the expression of IL-1 and IL-2 inflammation-related factors being increased."

30715176,orthopedics,"Currently, there is a dearth of information regarding the degree of particle shedding from breast implants (BIs) and what are the general biological consequences of BI debris. Thus, it is unclear to what degree BI debris compromises the long-term biological performance of BIs. For orthopedic implants, it is well established that the severity of biological reactivity to implant debris governs long-term clinical performance. Orthopedic implant particulate debris is generally in the range of 0.01 to 100 μm in diameter. Implant debris-induced bioreactivity/inflammation is mostly a peri-implant phenomenon caused by local innate immune cells (eg, macrophages) that produce proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and prostaglandin 2 (PGE2). In orthopedics, there have been few systemic concerns associated with polymeric implant debris (like silicone) other than documented dissemination to remote organs (eg, liver, spleen, etc.) with no known associated pathogenicity. This is not true of metal implant debris where normal (well-functioning) implants can induce systemic reactions such as delayed type hypersensitivity. Diagnostic analysis of orthopedic tissues has focused on innate (macrophage mediated) and adaptive (lymphocyte-mediated hypersensitivity) immune responses. Orthopedic implant debris-associated lymphocyte cancers have not been reported in over 40 years of orthopedic literature. Adaptive immune responses such as hypersensitivity reactions to orthopedic implant debris have been dominated by certain implant types that produce specific kinds of debris (eg, metal-on-metal total joint prostheses). Orthopedic hypersensitivity responses and atypical BI bioreactivity such as BI-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma share crossover markers for diagnosis. Differentiating normal innate immune reactivity to particles from anaplastic large cell lymphoma reactions from delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to BI-associated implant debris remains unclear but vital to patients and surgeons."

In addition, the movement patterns of human muscles are also becoming more complex due to diversification of the human living environment. An analysis of the movement patterns of normal people's muscles contracting with age and that of patients who are being treated in a hospital, including the disabled, will help improve life patterns, medical treatment patterns, and quality of life. In this study, the researchers developed a smart electromyogram (EMG) sensor which can improve human life patterns through EMG range and pattern recognition, which is beyond the conventional simple EMG measurement level. The developed sensor has a high gain of 10,000 times or more, noise of 500 uVrms or less, and common mode rejection ratio (CMRR) of 100 dB or more for EMG level and pattern recognition. The pattern recognition time of the sensor is 30 s. All the circuits developed in this study have a phase margin of 75 degrees or more for stability. Standard 0.25 μm complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology was used for the integrated circuit design. The system error rate was confirmed to be 1% or less through a clinical trial conducted on five males in their 40s and three females in their 30s for the past two years.

30714470,orthopedics,"This biomechanical study evaluated comparison osteosynthesis of the femoral neck fracture model by 3 cannulated screw implants and new perforated H beam implants under different loading conditions with 45 third generation right proximal femur bones. A standardized Pauwels Type 3 of the femoral neck fracture was performed in the femur models. For assessing the rigidity and strength of fixation methods, the proximal femur bones after their osteosynthesis were then mechanically tested in axial compression, and torsional and dynamic axial compression loading. To determine the structural advantage of the new implant system, perforated and nonperforated new implant systems were comparing about pull out performance. When loading the samples, photographs were taken continuously. The reference parameters were described and measured from unloaded and loaded photographs of the static and dynamic tests. There was no significant difference between stiffness values of two fixation methods under static and rotational loading. Under dynamic loading, the displacement of the superior point of femoral head at the fracture line showed a significant decrease between the new implant system and cannulated screws. Comparing the relative motion at the mid line of the fracture in femoral neck between groups, a significant increase was found in H Beam implant group. Perforated H beam implants have similar static and torsion properties with golden standard. Although there was significant difference under dynamic loading which simulate movement early after surgery, the patient was not allowed to move early after surgery in the clinical practice. Therefore, the differences due to the perforated ""H"" beam implant would not cause clinical insecurity. Therefore, it is assumed that the perforated ""H"" beam implant can be used for internal fixation as an alternative to cannulated screws in the treatment of instable femoral neck fracture."

30714008,orthopedics,"Age-related degenerative changes and non-spondylotic pathologies of the cervical spine such as trauma and tumor can lead to compression of neurological structures and result in substantial alteration of the structural anatomy. The end-goal of surgical intervention is to decompress the neural structures which can be achieved via an anterior or a posterior approach, and stabilization of segments to restore stability and alignment. Three-dimensional printing (3DP or Additive Manufacturing) has been applied to the field of medicine, in particular orthopedics and neurosurgery. Coupled with advances of medical imaging such as computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), accurate 3D models of patient anatomy can be produced, and patient-specific implants (PSIs) for complex anatomical reconstruction have all been applied with positive outcomes. 3D printed implants have been applied in particular to the cervical spine predominantly due to the complex and relatively small osteological anatomy and the proximity of important neurovascular structures to the surgical sites. The purpose of this review is to evaluate the current application of 3DP for cervical spinal implants. This includes a review on the available literature on 3D printed PSIs and current available 3D printed ""off-the-shelf"" (OTS) implants (3D-OTS). Suitable materials for 3DP of spinal implants and the future prospect of cervical implants will be discussed. The review will be concluded with a suggested guide for carrying future studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 3DP for cervical spinal implants."

30713696,orthopedics,"Antibody-based cancer immune therapy has attracted lots of research interest in recent years; however, it is greatly limited by the easy distribution and burst release of antibodies. In addition, after the clearance of the tissue, healthy tissue regeneration is another challenge for cancer treatment. Herein, we have developed a specific immunological tissue engineering scaffold using the agonistic mouse anti-human CD40 antibody (CD40mAb) incorporated into poly(l-lactide) (PLLA) electrospun fibers through the dopamine (PDA) motif (PLLA-PDA-CD40mAb). CD40mAb is successfully incorporated onto the surface of the electrospun fibrous scaffold, which is proved by immunofluorescence staining, and the PLLA-PDA-CD40mAb scaffold has an anti-tumor effect by locally releasing CD40mAb. Therefore, this immunological electrospun scaffold has very good potential to be developed as a powerful tool for localized tumor treatment, and this is the first to be reported in this area."
30713248,orthopedics,"Bisphosphonates (BPs) bind strongly to bone and exhibit long-acting anti-bone-resorptive effects. Among BPs, nitrogen-containing BPs (N-BPs) have far stronger anti-bone-resorptive effects than non-N-BPs. However, N-BPs induce acute inflammatory reactions (fever, arthralgia and myalgia, etc.) after their first injection. The mechanisms underlying these side effects remain unclear. Zoledronate (one of the most potent N-BPs) is given intravenously to patients, and the side-effect incidence is reportedly the highest among N-BPs. Our murine experiments have clarified that (a) intraperitoneally injected N-BPs induce various inflammatory reactions, including a production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) (a typical inflammatory cytokine), and these inflammatory reactions are weak in IL-1-deficient mice, (b) subcutaneously injected N-BPs induce inflammation/necrosis at the injection site, (c) lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a cell-wall component of Gram-negative bacteria) and N-BPs mutually augment their inflammatory/necrotic effects, (d) the non-N-BP clodronate can reduce N-BPs' inflammatory/necrotic effects. However, there are few animal studies on the side effects of intravenously injected N-BPs. Here, we found in mice that (i) intravenous zoledronate exhibited weaker inflammatory effects than intraperitoneal zoledronate, (ii) in mice given intravenous zoledronate, LPS-induced production of IL-1α and IL-1β was augmented in various tissues, including bone, resulting in them increasing in serum, and (iii) clodronate (given together with zoledronate) prevented such augmentation and enhanced, slightly but significantly, zoledronate's anti-bone-resorptive effect. These results suggest that infection may be a factor promoting the acute inflammatory side effects of N-BPs via augmented production of IL-1 in various tissues (including bone), and that clodronate may be useful to reduce or prevent such side effects."

30713039,orthopedics,"The adult CNS has poor ability to replace degenerated neurons following injury or disease. Recently, direct reprogramming of astrocytes into induced neurons has been proposed as an innovative strategy toward CNS repair. As a cell population that shows high diversity on physiological properties and functions depending on their spatiotemporal distribution, however, whether the astrocyte heterogeneity affect neuronal reprogramming is not clear. Here, we show that astrocytes derived from cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord exhibit biological heterogeneity and possess distinct susceptibility to transcription factor-induced neuronal reprogramming. The heterogeneous expression level of NOTCH1 signaling in the different CNS regions-derived astrocytes is shown to be responsible for the neuronal reprogramming diversity. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that region-restricted astrocytes reveal different intrinsic limitation of the response to neuronal reprogramming."

30712506,orthopedics,"The management and treatment of tissue infection, especially chronic infection, represents a significant challenge. Application of autologous platelet rich plasma (PRP) has emerged as a promising adjunct therapy for facilitating the healing of surgical wounds and tissue injuries. PRP is extracted from whole blood using a sequential centrifugation technique and when activated, can release a vast array of antimicrobial proteins, cytokines, and growth factors. These bioactive molecules are responsible for the ability of PRP to kill pathogens, resolve necrotic tissue, and promote wound healing. PRP is emerging as a useful supplement to prevent postoperative infection and treat chronic wound or bone infections. PRP displays a synergistic effect with antibiotics, which provides unique advantages when treating antibiotic resistant bacteria. This review will describe the method for PRP preparation and its antibacterial properties, as well as discuss both preclinical in vivo results and evidence from clinical practice of PRP use for the treatment of wound and bone infections."
