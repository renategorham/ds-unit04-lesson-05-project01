29683709,allograph,"It is well-established that allographs like the uppercase and lowercase forms of the Roman alphabet (e.g., a and A) map onto the same ""abstract letter identity,"" orthographic representations that are independent of the visual form. Consistent with this, in the allograph match task (""Are 'a' and 'A' the same letter?""), priming by a masked letter prime is equally robust for visually dissimilar prime-target pairs (e.g., d and D) and similar pairs (e.g., c and C). However, in principle this pattern of priming is also consistent with the possibility that allograph priming is purely phonological, based on the letter name. Because different allographic forms of the same letter, by definition, share a letter name, it is impossible to rule out this possibility a priori. In the present study, we investigated the influence of shared letter names by taking advantage of the fact that Japanese is written in two distinct writing systems, syllabic kana-that has two parallel forms, hiragana and katakana-and logographic kanji. Using the allograph match task, we tested whether a kanji prime with the same pronunciation as the target kana (e.g., - い, both pronounced /i/) produces the same amount of priming as a kana prime in the opposite kana form (e.g., イ- い). We found that the kana primes produced substantially greater priming than the phonologically identical kanji prime, which we take as evidence that allograph priming is based on abstract kana identity, not purely phonology.

29286229,allograph,"Background: Chemotherapy for advanced cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is largely ineffective; thus innovative
combinations of chemotherapeutic agents and natural compounds represent a promising strategy. This study aimed to
investigate the synergistic effects of forbesione combined with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in hamster cholangiocarcinoma
(Ham-1) cells both in vitro and in vivo. The anti-tumor effects of 5-FU combined with forbesione in vitro were determined
using the Sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and the effects in vivo were assessed in transplanted Ham-1 allograph
models. Using ethidium bromide/acridine orange (EB/AO) staining, the morphological changes of apoptotic cells
was investigated. The expressions of apoptosis-related molecules after combined treatment with forbesione and 5-FU
were determined using real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis. Forbesione or 5-FU alone inhibited proliferation
of Ham-1 cells in a dose-dependent manner and their combination showed a synergistic proliferation inhibitory effect
in vitro. In vivo studies, forbesione in combination with 5-FU exhibited greater inhibition of the tumor in the hamster
model compared with treatment using either drug alone. Forbesione combined with 5-FU exerted stronger apoptotic
induction in Ham-1 cells than did single drug treatment. The combination of drugs strongly suppressed the expression
of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and procaspase-3 while enhancing the expression of p53, Bcl-2-associated X protein
(Bax), apoptotic protease activating factor-1 (Apaf-1), caspase-9 and caspase-3, compared with single drug treatments.
These results explained the decreased expression of cytokeratin 19 (CK19) positive cells and proliferation cell nuclear
antigen (PCNA) positive cells in Ham-1 cell tumor tissues of the treated hamsters. There was no apparent systemic
toxicity observed in the treated animals compared with the control groups. Forbesione combined with 5-FU strongly
induced apoptosis in Ham-1 cells. The growth inhibitory effect of combined treatment using these two drugs was much
greater than treatment with either drug alone, both in vitro and in vivo."
28843097,allograph,"This paper presents a review on the state of the art in offline text-independent writer identification methods for three major languages, namely English, Chinese and Arabic, which were published in literatures from 2011 till 2016. For ease of discussions, we grouped the techniques into three categories: texture-, structure-, and allograph-based. Results are analysed, compared and tabulated along with datasets used for fair and just comparisons. It is observed that during that period, there are significant progresses achieved on English and Arabic; however, the growth on Chinese is rather slow and far from satisfactory in comparison to its wide usage. This is due to its complex writing structure. Meanwhile, issues on datasets used by previous studies are also highlighted because the size matter - accuracy of the writer identification deteriorates as database size increases."

28368166,allograph,"The literate brain must contend with countless font variants for any given letter. How does the visual system handle such variability? One proposed solution posits stored structural descriptions of basic letter shapes that are abstract enough to deal with the many possible font variations of each letter. These font-invariant representations, referred to as allographs in this paper, while frequently posited, have seldom been empirically evaluated. The research reported here helps to address this gap with 2 experiments that examine the possible influence of allograph representations on visual letter processing. In these experiments, participants respond to pairs of letters presented in an atypical font in 2 tasks-visual similarity judgments (Experiment 1) and same/different decisions (Experiment 2). By using representational similarity analysis (RSA) in conjunction with linear mixed effect models (LMEM; RSA-LMEM) we show that the similarity structure of the responses to the atypical font is influenced by the predicted similarity structure of allograph representations even after accounting for font-specific visual shape similarity. Similarity due to symbolic (abstract) identity, name, and motor representations of letters are also taken into account providing compelling evidence for the unique influence of allograph representations in these tasks. These results provide support for the role of allograph representations in achieving font-invariant letter identification. (PsycINFO Database Record"

A sample of 986 children from Grades 1 through 3 were classified according to transcription skills measured by keyboard ability (poor vs. good) across the grades. Results demonstrated that fluency in writing the alphabet and selecting allographs mediated the differences in spelling between good and poor keyboarders in the free-writing task. Execution in the allograph selection task and writing alphabet from memory had different degrees of predictability in each of the groups in explaining the level of fluency and spelling in the free-writing task sentences, depending on the grade. These results suggest that early assessment of writing by means of the computer keyboard can provide clues and guidelines for intervention and training to strengthen specific skills to improve writing performance in the early primary grades in transcription skills by keyboarding."

For this purpose, exploratory factor analysis for the TEVET was conducted. Principal component analysis with a varimax rotation identified three factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.0. Based on factorial analysis, we analyzed the keyboarding skills across grades in Spanish elementary school children with and without LD (i.e., poor handwriters compared with poor spellers, who in turn were compared with mixed compared with typically achieving writers). The results indicated that poor handwriters did not differ from typically achieving writers in phonological processing, visual-orthographic processing, and sentence production components by keyboarding. The educational implications of the findings are analyzed with regard to acquisition of keyboarding skills in children with and without LD in transcription."
26278275,allograph,"The Youden index is a commonly employed metric to characterize the performance of a diagnostic test at its optimal point. For tests with three or more outcome classes, the Youden index has been extended; however, there are limited methods to compute a confidence interval (CI) about its value. Often, outcome classes are assumed to be normally distributed, which facilitates computational formulas for the CI bounds; however, many scenarios exist for which these assumptions cannot be made. In addition, many of these existing CI methods do not work well for small sample sizes. We propose a method to compute a nonparametric interval about the Youden index utilizing the fiducial argument. This fiducial interval ensures that CI coverage is met regardless of sample size, underlying distributional assumptions, or use of a complex classifier for diagnosis. Two alternate fiducial intervals are also considered. A simulation was conducted, which demonstrates the coverage and interval length for the proposed methods. Comparisons were made using no distributional assumptions on the outcome classes and for when outcomes were assumed to be normally distributed. In general, coverage probability was consistently met, and interval length was reasonable. The proposed fiducial method was also demonstrated in data examining biomarkers in subjects to predict diagnostic stages ranging from normal kidney function to chronic allograph nephropathy.

First, building on the work of other researchers, we present evidence that the prelexical reading system includes an allograph level of representation that represents each distinct visual shape of a letter (e.g., a, A, etc., for the letter A).

21137679,allograph,"Pig-to-human xenotransplantation of islet cells or of vascularized organs would offer a welcome treatment alternative for the ever-increasing number of patients with end-stage organ failure who are waiting for a suitable allograph. The main hurdle are preexisting antibodies, most of which are specific for 'Linear-B', carbohydrate epitopes terminated by the unbranched Gal-alpha(1,3)Gal disaccharide. These antibodies are responsible for the 'hyper-acute rejection' of the xenograft by complement mediated hemorrhage. For depletion of such antibodies we have developed an artificial injectable antigen, a glycopolymer (GAS914) with a charge neutral poly-lysine backbone (degree of polymerization n = 1000) and 25% of its side chains coupled to Linear-B-trisaccharide. With an average molecular weight of 400 to 500 kD, presenting 250 trisaccharide epitopes per molecule, this multivalent array binds anti-alphaGal antibodies with at least three orders of magnitude higher avidity on a per-saccharide basis than the monomeric epitope. In vivo experiments with non-human primates documented that rather low doses--1 to 5 mg/kg of GAS914 injected i.v.--efficiently reduce the load of anti-Linear-B antibodies quickly by at least 80%. This treatment can be repeated without any sensitization to GAS914. Interestingly, although the antibody levels start raising 12 h after injection, they do not reach pretreatment levels. The polymer is degraded and excreted within hours, with a minute fraction remaining in lymphoid tissue of anti-alphaGal producing animals only, probably binding to and inhibiting antibody-producing B-cells. The results of pig-to-non-human primate xenotransplantations established GAS914 as a relevant therapeutic option for pig-to-human transplantations as well. The synthesis of GAS914 was successfully scaled up to kg amounts needed for first clinical studies. Key was the use of galactosyl transferases and UDP-galactose for the synthesis of the trisaccharide."

Using a codebook of CO3s from an independent training set of 100 writers, the probability-density function (PDF) of CO3s was computed for an independent test set containing 150 unseen writers. Results revealed a high-sensitivity of the CO3 PDF for identifying individual writers on the basis of a single sentence of uppercase characters. The proposed automatic approach bridges the gap between image-statistics approaches on one end and manually measured allograph features of individual characters on the other end. Combining the CO3 PDF with an independent edge-based orientation and curvature PDF yielded very high correct identification rates."

A new heterotypic T-cell adhesion assay was also developed to provide a model for the T-cell adhesion process during lung inflammation. Two hexapeptides, ITDGEA and DGEATD, were found to be more active than the other linear hexapeptides. The cyclic derivative of ITDGEA [i.e. cyclo(1,6)ITDGEA] has similar activity than the parent linear peptide and has lower activity than cLAB.L peptide. Computational-binding experiments were carried out to explain the possible mechanism of binding of these peptides to intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Both ITDGEA and DGEATD bind the same site on intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and they interact with the Gln34 and Gln73 residues on D1 of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. In the future, more potent derivatives of cyclo(1,6)ITDGEA will be designed by utilizing structural and binding studies of the peptide to intercellular adhesion molecule-1.

17299226,allograph,"The identification of a person on the basis of scanned images of handwriting is a useful biometric modality with application in forensic and historic document analysis and constitutes an exemplary study area within the research field of behavioral biometrics. We developed new and very effective techniques for automatic writer identification and verification that use probability distribution functions (PDFs) extracted from the handwriting images to characterize writer individuality. A defining property of our methods is that they are designed to be independent of the textual content of the handwritten samples. Our methods operate at two levels of analysis: the texture level and the character-shape (allograph) level. At the texture level, we use contour-based joint directional PDFs that encode orientation and curvature information to give an intimate characterization of individual handwriting style. In our analysis at the allograph level, the writer is considered to be characterized by a stochastic pattern generator of ink-trace fragments, or graphemes. The PDF of these simple shapes in a given handwriting sample is characteristic for the writer and is computed using a common shape codebook obtained by grapheme clustering. Combining multiple features (directional, grapheme, and run-length PDFs) yields increased writer identification and verification performance. The proposed methods are applicable to free-style handwriting (both cursive and isolated) and have practical feasibility, under the assumption that a few text lines of handwritten material are available in order to obtain reliable probability estimates."

The objective of this study was to analyze the results obtained with the use of a calcineurin inhibitor-free immunosuppressive protocol (polyclonal antibody induction, plus sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and low doses of steroids) in terms of graft and patient survival as well as posttransplant clinical complications over 2 years. Under this immunosuppressive protocol, 78.04% of the patients completed the follow-up. A protocol biopsy was performed on 17 patients (53.1%) within 2 years posttransplant of which 82.31% were diagnosed as chronic allograph nephropathy grade I. The incidence of clinical complications was low and not significantly different from that reported with other immunosuppressive schemes. Death-censored graft survival was 95.12%. In conclusion, the use of a calcineurin inhibitor-free protocol in renal-transplant recipients of expanded criteria deceased donors was associated with excellent graft and patient survival rates and a low incidence of adverse events."
17021345,allograph,"During the invasive phase of implantation, trophoblasts and maternal decidual stromal cells secrete products that regulate trophoblast differentiation and migration into the maternal endometrium. Paracrine interactions between the extravillous trophoblast and the maternal decidua are important for successful embryonic implantation, including establishing the placental vasculature, anchoring the placenta to the uterine wall, and promoting the immunoacceptance of the fetal allograph. To our knowledge, global crosstalk between the trophoblast and the decidua has not been elucidated to date, and the present study used a functional genomics approach to investigate these paracrine interactions. Human endometrial stromal cells were decidualized with progesterone and further treated with conditioned media from human trophoblasts (TCM) or, as a control, with control conditioned media (CCM) from nondecidualized stromal cells for 0, 3, and 12 h. Total RNA was isolated and processed for analysis on whole-genome, high-density oligonucleotide arrays containing 54,600 genes. We found that 1374 genes were significantly upregulated and that 3443 genes were significantly downregulated after 12 h of coincubation of stromal cells with TCM, compared to CCM. Among the most upregulated genes were the chemokines CXCL1 (GRO1) and IL8,CXCR4, and other genes involved in the immune response (CCL8 [SCYA8], pentraxin 3 (PTX3), IL6, and interferon-regulated and -related genes) as well as TNFAIP6 (tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced protein 6) and metalloproteinases (MMP1, MMP10, and MMP14). Among the downregulated genes were growth factors, e.g., IGF1, FGF1, TGFB1, and angiopoietin-1, and genes involved in Wnt signaling (WNT4 and FZD). Real-time RT-PCR and ELISAs, as well as immunohistochemical analysis of human placental bed specimens, confirmed these data for representative genes of both up- and downregulated groups. The data demonstrate a significant induction of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as angiogenic/static factors in decidualized endometrial stromal cells in response to trophoblast-secreted products. The data suggest that the trophoblast acts to alter the local immune environment of the decidua to facilitate the process of implantation and ensure an enriched cytokine/chemokine environment while limiting the mitotic activity of the stromal cells during the invasive phase of implantation."
16400684,allograph,"While lung transplant is an effective therapy for advanced lung disease, chronic allograph rejection remains a primary basis for lower survival rates than those for other solid organ transplants. This study used carefully controlled Zip-Tip extraction of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) followed by MALDI-TOF MS to identify biomarkers of chronic lung transplant rejection. Many differences were observed between controls, those who did not develop chronic rejection within 100 months, and patients who had developed chronic rejection, diagnosed as bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS). Intensity ratios of peaks within the same MALDI-TOF profile were used to quantify the result. One of the best identifiers of BOS was a lowered ratio of clara cell protein (CCP m/z = 15,835) to lysozyme (m/z = 14,700), which gave 94% specificity and 74% sensitivity for diagnosis. Furthermore, low values for CCP/Lysozyme (<0.3) were observed in 66% of samples taken at 1 to 15 months prior to the diagnosis of BOS. Many other components of the profile gave similar or better outcomes for diagnosis but tended to be less valuable for the prediction of future disease.

20945218,allograph,"This paper describes the case of a unilateral agraphic patient (GG) who makes letter substitutions only when writing letters and words with his dominant left hand. Accuracy is significantly greater when he is writing with his right hand and when he is asked to spell words orally. GG also makes case errors when writing letters, and will sometimes write words in mixed case. However, these allograph errors occur regardless of which hand he is using to write. In terms of cognitive models of peripheral dysgraphia (e.g., Ellis, 1988), it appears that he has an allograph level impairment that affects writing with both hands, and a separate problem in accessing graphic motor patterns that disrupts writing with the left hand only. In previous studies of left-handed patients with unilateral agraphia (Zesiger & Mayer, 1992; Zesiger, Pegna, & Rilliet, 1994), it has been suggested that allographic knowledge used for writing with both hands is stored exclusively in the left hemisphere, but that graphic motor patterns are represented separately in each hemisphere. The pattern of performance demonstrated by GG strongly supports such a conclusion."

Dependent variables were spatial errors, movement time, movement dysfluencies, trajectory length, stroke curvature, and the degree of neuromotor noise in the movement velocity profiles. The latter variable was measured by means of Power Spectral Density Analysis of the movement velocity signal, which revealed that movements of poor writers were substantially more noisy than those of proficient writers, with a noise peak in the region of neuromotor tremor. At the same time, the poor writers were less accurate. It was concluded that control of spatial accuracy rather than allograph retrieval or size control is the discriminating feature in dysgraphic children. Moreover, poor writers do not catch up with their peers within the 1 year time span tested."

The analysis of the wound by optical and electron microscopy did not detect cells with morphological characteristics of phagocytes in it. The wound is completely covered by the external cuticle of the animal 24 hr after the lesion was made. A second section of the animal leads to abnormal healing of the lesion. The insertion of a surgical silk thread in the muscle of the animals results--after 13 days--in a collection of cells surrounding the foreign body. The ultrastructural analysis of these cells showed they are endothelial cells rather than specialized phagocytes. Yet, the Amphioxus is able to mount an allograph rejection when the animals are tied together by suture. This intriguing capacity of the Amphioxus to cope with tissue healing, infection, and other pathologies without phagocytes is discussed."

Eleven uncomplicated gravidas were followed serially through each trimester and compared to 11 nonpregnant female controls. Mononuclear cells were acquired by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation of heparinized blood. Chang liver cells infected with HSV-I were utilized as target cells in a 51Cr release assay. Mean NKC values in the pregnant patients were uniformly lower than in the controls. No similar decreases in ADCC activity were observed in a comparison between the two study populations.

Results showed that the expression of H-2 antigens is different before and after implantation. It seems that after implantation, H-2 antigens disappear from trophoblastic membranes. This could explain the absence of immunological reaction of the mother against the foetus."
85580,allograph,"Two almost identical groups of 258 patients each who underwent surgery for the substitution of one or more than one cardiac valve were taken into consideration. After surgery all patients, with the exception of those who received a porcine allograph, were given coumarin drugs for 1 year for thrombosis prophylaxis. In the first group of patients operated in 1972 and 1973 the laboratory follow-up and the therapeutic range were neither constant nor uniform. In the case of the second group, which included patients operated in 1974 and 1975, adequate laboratory follow-up and constantly adequate therapeutic ranges were always kept. This retrospective study has shown a statistically significant decrease in mortality due to thromboembolism and to unknown causes in the second group of patients (x2 = 8,313, ""p"" less than 0,0025). A decrease of the non-lethal embolic complications was also noted in the second group of patients (x2 = 6,813, ""p"" less than 0,0025). On the other hand, bleeding complications were greater in the second group of patients (x2 = 3,485, ""p"" less than 0,05) and this was interpreted as secondary to the higher anticoagulation administered to the latter patients. The results indicate that an adequate coumarin anticoagulation seems able to decrease the incidence of lethal or non-lethal thromboembolic complications after cardiac valve replacement significantly."
