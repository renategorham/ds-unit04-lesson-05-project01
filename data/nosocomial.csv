Copper has been reported to possess bacteriocidal effects, and the introduction of copper-impregnated products is receiving attention as a potential component of hospital infection control. In this study, copper-impregnated door handles as highly touched areas were introduced in a hematology ward, and their bacteriocidal effects were evaluated in comparison with conventional products. All 12 samples obtained from conventional door handles were positive for bacterial cultures, whereas only 5 of 18 samples from copper-impregnated handles were positive (P<0.0001). The mean number of bacterial colonies per milliliter of sample was 300 (range: 40-1.1×10<sup>6</sup>) in samples from conventional handles, but it was significantly lower in samples from copper-impregnated handles (0; range: 0-220, P<0.0001). While various types of bacteria grew on conventional handles, most of the bacteria on copper-impregnated handles were Bacillus subtilis. These results suggest that the introduction of copper-impregnated products would be useful for hospital infection control by reducing the bacterial burden on highly touched areas. However, the efficacy of this approach against spore-forming bacteria should be further investigated."

Bifidobacterium and strains of lactic acid bacteria are the most widely used bacteria that exhibit probiotic properties and are included in many functional foods and dietary supplements. Probiotics have been shown to prevent and ameliorate the course of digestive disorders such as acute, nosocomial, and antibiotic-associated diarrhea; allergic disorders such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) and allergic rhinitis in infants; and Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea and some inflammatory bowel disorders in adults. In addition, probiotics may be of interest as coadjuvants in the treatment of metabolic disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and type 2 diabetes. However, the mechanisms of action of probiotics, which are diverse, heterogeneous, and strain specific, have received little attention. Thus, the aim of the present work was to review the main mechanisms of action of probiotics, including colonization and normalization of perturbed intestinal microbial communities in children and adults; competitive exclusion of pathogens and bacteriocin production; modulation of fecal enzymatic activities associated with the metabolization of biliary salts and inactivation of carcinogens and other xenobiotics; production of short-chain and branched-chain fatty acids, which, in turn, have wide effects not only in the intestine but also in peripheral tissues via interactions with short-chain fatty acid receptors, modulating mainly tissue insulin sensitivity; cell adhesion and mucin production; modulation of the immune system, which results mainly in the differentiation of T-regulatory cells and upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, i.e., interleukin-10 and transforming growth factor; and interaction with the brain-gut axis by regulation of endocrine and neurologic functions.

Our previous study also found the existence of endemic strains in a cancer center in Tianjin, China. In the current study, we performed further investigation on endemic and non-endemic Candida albicans strains, with the aim of explaining the higher morbidity of endemic strains. In an in vivo experiment, mice infected with endemic strains showed significantly shorter survival time and higher kidney fungal burdens compared to mice infected with non-endemic strains. In an in vitro experiment, the killing percentage of neutrophils to endemic strains was significantly lower than that to non-endemic strains, which is positively linked to the ratio of LC3B-II/I in neutrophils. An immunofluorescence assay showed more β-1,3-glucan exposure on the cell walls of nonendemic strains compared to endemic strains. After blocking the β-glucan receptor (CR3) or inhibiting downstream kinase (SYK) in neutrophils, the killing percent to C. albicans (regardless of endemic and non-endemic strains) and the ratio of LC3B-II/I of neutrophils were significantly decreased. These data suggested that the killing capability of neutrophils to C. albicans was monitored by β-1,3-glucan via CR3/SYK pathway-dependent LC3B-II accumulation and provided an explanation for the variable killing capability of neutrophils to different strains of C. albicans, which would be beneficial in improving infection control and therapeutic strategies for invasive candidiasis."

Therefore the aim of current study is to explore the protective effects and understand the underlying mechanisms for the beneficial effects of live combined <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (LCBE) in cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. <b>Methods and Results:</b> Seven-week-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: sham group (6 mice), CLP-control group (20 mice, pretreatment with saline for 7 days before CLP surgery) and CLP-probiotics group (14 mice, pretreatment with LCBE enteric-coated capsules for 7 days before CLP surgery). In survival experiment, mice were monitored for 7 days after CLP. After the procedure, mice were sacrificed, and, serum, and peritoneal lavage fluid were collected and intestinal ileal samples were harvested. <b>Results:</b> Our results showed that the mortality was significantly reduced in mice CLP-probiotics group vs. CLP-control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Also, treatment CLP-probiotics group decreased the injury scores CLP-probiotics group when compared to CLP-control group. Additionally, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α levels in the serum and intestinal ileal tissues of CLP-probiotics group were reduced when compared to CLP-control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). However, no significant differences in anti-inflammatory levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1 were observed between CLP-control and CLP-probiotic groups. Furthermore, our experiments showed that that probiotic treatment suppressed the macrophage activation and transformation from M-type to M1-type, inhibited the mast cells (MCs) degranulation, and activation of AKT (kinase B) pathway. <b>Conclusion:</b> In conclusion, our data shows that probiotics have a protective role in CLP septic mice through reducing intestinal inflammation, altering macrophage polarization and MCs degranulation, and regulating AKT signaling. <b>Significance and Impact of Study:</b> This study demonstrated the protective effects and mechanisms involved in the protective role of live combined <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (LCBE) in CLP-induced septic mice model."
30718286,nosocomial,"<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> is an important nosocomial pathogen. Mechanisms that allow <i>A. baumannii</i> to cause human infection are still poorly understood. Iron is an essential nutrient for bacterial growth <i>in vivo</i>, and the multiplicity of iron-uptake systems in <i>A. baumannii</i> suggests that iron acquisition contributes to the ability of <i>A. baumannii</i> to cause infection. In Gram-negative bacteria, active transport of ferrisiderophores and heme relies on the conserved TonB-ExbB-ExbD energy-transducing complex, while active uptake of ferrous iron is mediated by the Feo system. The <i>A. baumannii</i> genome invariably contains three <i>tonB</i> genes (<i>tonB1</i>, <i>tonB2</i> and <i>tonB3</i>), whose role in iron-uptake is poorly understood. Here, we generated <i>A. baumannii</i> knock-out mutants in <i>feo</i> and/or <i>tonB</i> genes. We report that <i>tonB3</i> is essential for <i>A. baumannii</i> growth under iron limiting conditions, whereas <i>tonB1</i>, <i>tonB2</i> and <i>feoB</i> appear dispensable for ferric iron-uptake. <i>tonB3</i> deletion resulted in reduced intracellular iron content despite siderophore over-production, supporting a key role of TonB3 in iron-uptake. Different from <i>tonB1</i> and <i>tonB2</i>, the promoters of <i>tonB3</i> and <i>feo</i> contain functional Fur boxes and are up-regulated in iron-poor media. Both TonB3 and Feo systems are required for growth in complement-free human serum and contribute to resistance to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum, but only TonB3 appears to be essential for virulence in insect and mouse models of infection. Our findings highlight a central role of the TonB3 system for <i>A. baumannii</i> pathogenicity. Hence, TonB3 represents a promising target for novel anti-bacterial therapies and for the generation of attenuated vaccine strains."

A panel of gram positive and gram negative bacteria were employed for screening the comparative efficacy of the stilbenes. In addition, the mechanisms that contribute to the antibacterial activity were investigated and correlated to structural changes. Employing the notorious nosocomial agent S. aureus we show how changes in structure alters not only the antibacterial activity but also the underlying mechanisms. Antibacterial activity by CLSI (Clinical & Laboratory Standards Institute) guidelines, oxidative stress and membrane damage by fluorescence based methods, DNA binding by spectroscopy, DNA cleavage by gel electrophoresis, substrate efflux by efflux mutant and cell wall damage by scanning electron microscopy were investigated. Antibacterial activity varied drastically among stilbenes bearing different functional groups. The best stilbenes in terms of activity also scored higher in one or more molecular events that contribute to cell death. Stilbenes better than resveratrol were identified and probable cause for this was also identified.

We identified four capsule depolymerases in these phages that could only digest the capsule types of their respective hosts. Our results demonstrate that the activities of these capsule depolymerases were correlated with the host range of each phage; thus, the capsule depolymerases are host specificity determinants. By generating a capsule mutant, we demonstrate that capsule was essential for phage adsorption and infection. Further, capsule depolymerases can enhance bacterial susceptibility to serum killing. The discovery of these phages and depolymerases lays the foundation for the typing of KN1, KN3, KN4 and K56 Klebsiella and could be useful alternative therapeutics for the treatment of K. pneumoniae infections."

In this work, we report the effects of various natural substances on the formation of biofilm in <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i>, as well as its stability. The effect of the molecules on the growth of <i>K. pneumoniae</i> was initially determined by measuring the optical density. The modification of the biofilm, the changes relating to its resistance, the effects on the bacterial adhesion to the urethral catheter and its antagonist role the hexanoyl-homoserinelactone were assessed by crystal violet, as well as by microscopy. The best effects were obtained with 3-methyl-2(5H)-furanone and 2´-hydroxycinnamic acid, which inhibited the formation of biofilm by 67.38% and 65.06%, respectively. Additionally, the remaining biofilm formed was more susceptible to gentamicin. Through microscopy examination, there were evident changes in the biofilm and adherence on the polyvinyl chloride (PVC) urethral catheter.

Notably infants born prematurely and those with very low birth weight are at risk due to their immature and deficient immune system and their prolonged hospitalization which promotes nosocomial infections. In case of impending preterm birth, betamethasone is given to induce lung maturation and tocolytic agents like indomethacin or fenoterol are administered to suppress premature labor. The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of these drugs on the immune system of mothers and neonates. Therefore, mononuclear cells from cord blood and peripheral maternal blood were stimulated with Escherichia coli and incubated with betamethasone, indomethacin and fenoterol. Subsequently the effect of the treatment on cytokine production was determined. Betamethasone alone and in combination with tocolytic agents inhibited the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Not only does betamethasone dampen the immune response by reducing the production of cytokines, it also has a variety of other detrimental short- and long-term effects on the neonate.

Therefore, we first characterized the structures of the lipids A, the inflammatory inducing moieties of LPSs, of three Ralstonia species: Ralstonia eutropha, R. mannitolilytica and R. pickettii, and then compared each, in terms of in vitro inflammatory capacities. R. pickettii lipid A displaying only 5 Fatty Acids (FA) was a weaker inducer of inflammation, compared to the two other species harboring hexa-acylated lipids A, despite the presence of 2 AraN substituents on the phosphate groups. With regard to in vitro pro-inflammatory activities, TNF-α and IL-6 inducing capacities were compared on THP-1 cells treated with LPSs isolated from the three Ralstonia. R. pickettii, with low inflammatory capacities, and recently involved in nosocomial outcomes, could explain the low inflammatory level reported in previous studies on diabetic patients and animals. In addition, transmission electron microscopy was performed on the three Ralstonia species. It showed that the R. pickettii under-acylated LPSs, with a higher level of phosphate substitution had the capacity of producing more outer membrane vesicles (OMVs). The latter could facilitate transfer of LPSs to the blood and explain the increased low-grade inflammation observed in obese/diabetic patients."

The importance of the gut microbiota in providing protection from CDI is underscored by the reported 80 to 90% success rate of fecal microbial transplants in treating recurrent infections. Adaptive immunity, specifically humoral immunity, is also sufficient to protect from both acute and recurrent CDI. However, the role of the adaptive immune system in mediating clearance of <i>C. difficile</i> has yet to be resolved. Using murine models of CDI, we found that adaptive immunity is dispensable for clearance of <i>C. difficile</i> However, random forest analysis using only two members of the resident bacterial community correctly identified animals that would go on to clear the infection with 66.7% accuracy.

Here, we characterized the gut microbiota from the feces of 57 patients with diarrhea from nosocomial and community-acquired CDI. We performed an ecological analysis by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of 16S rRNA amplicons and evaluated the association of the various ecological profiles with CDI risk factors. Among all samples <i>Bacteroidaceae</i> 31.01%, <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> 9.82%, <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> 9.33%, <i>Tannerellaceae</i> 6,16%, and <i>Ruminococcaceae</i> 5.64%, were the most abundant families. A reduced abundance of <i>Bacteroides</i> was associated with a poor CDI prognosis, with severe diarrhea and a high incidence of recurrence. This reduction was associated with a weakened host immune system and previous aggressive antibiotherapy. <i>Peptostreptococcaceae</i> family was 1.56% overall and within the family the only identified member was the genus <i>Clostridioides</i>, positively correlated with the presence of <i>Akkermansia</i> that may be predictive of the presence of a CDI. Finally, a relevant aspect that must be considered in clinical practice is the misdiagnosis of CDI, as patients with a stool sample that tests positive for <i>C. difficile</i> are usually diagnosed with CDI and subsequently treated as such. However, co-infection with other pathogenic agents often plays an important role in the development of diarrhea, and must be considered when prescribing antibiotic treatment."

30692235,nosocomial,"<i>Burkholderia cepacia</i> is a ubiquitous, opportunistic, environmental gram-negative bacillus which most commonly affects cystic fibrosis and immunocompromised patients. Rarely, it can cause peritoneal dialysis (PD) exit-site infection (ESI). Information relating to predisposing factors, clinical course, and treatment options for <i>B. cepacia</i> ESIs is limited. Although reports of <i>B. cepacia</i> healthcare-associated infections exist, outbreaks in PD units have not previously been reported. A recent outbreak of <i>B. cepacia</i> ESI in our PD unit provided a unique opportunity to study <i>B. cepacia</i> ESIs and to outline an approach to investigating such an outbreak.After unexpectedly identifying <i>B. cepacia</i> as the cause of PD catheter ESIs in 3 patients over an 11-week period, we began systematically screening our PD population for <i>B. cepacia</i> exit-site colonization. A further 6 patients were found to be affected, 3 with asymptomatic colonization and 3 with symptomatic <i>B. cepacia</i> ESI. Four of the 6 developed tunnel infections requiring multiple courses of antibiotic treatment, and 3 patients required catheter removal; 2 patients with symptomatic ESIs without tunnel involvement responded to oral and topical antibiotics. Further investigation implicated 4% chlorhexidine aqueous bodywash used by all patients as the probable source of the outbreak.This is the first reported outbreak of <i>B. cepacia</i> ESIs. We noted an association between diabetes mellitus and refractory/more extensive infection. Our experience suggests that isolated ESIs can be treated successfully with oral antibiotics whereas tunnel infections generally require catheter removal."
30692174,nosocomial,"Spores are the major infectious particle of the Gram-positive nosocomial pathogen, <i>Clostridioides</i> (formerly <i>Clostridium</i>) <i>difficile</i>, but the molecular details of how this organism forms these metabolically dormant cells remain poorly characterized. The composition of the spore coat in <i>C. difficile</i> differs markedly from that defined in the well-studied organism, <i>Bacillus subtilis</i>, with only 25% of the ∼70 spore coat proteins being conserved between the two organisms, and only 2 of 9 coat assembly (morphogenetic) proteins defined in <i>B. subtilis</i> having homologs in <i>C. difficile.</i> We previously identified SipL as a clostridia-specific coat protein essential for functional spore formation. Heterologous expression analyses in <i>E. coli</i> revealed that SipL directly interacts with <i>C. difficile</i> SpoIVA, a coat morphogenetic protein conserved in all spore-forming organisms, through SipL's C-terminal LysM domain. In this study, we show that SpoIVA-SipL binding is essential for <i>C. difficile</i> spore formation and identify specific residues within the LysM domain that stabilize this interaction. Fluorescence microscopy analyses indicate that binding of SipL's LysM domain to SpoIVA is required for SipL to localize to the forespore, while SpoIVA requires SipL to promote encasement of SpoIVA around the forespore. Since we also show that clostridial LysM domains are functionally interchangeable at least in <i>C. difficile</i>, the basic mechanism for SipL-dependent assembly of clostridial spore coats may be conserved.<b>Importance</b> The metabolically dormant spore-form of the major nosocomial pathogen, <i>Clostridioides difficile</i>, is its major infectious particle. However, the mechanisms controlling the formation of these resistant cell types are not well understood, particularly with respect to its outermost layer, the spore coat. We previously identified two spore morphogenetic proteins in <i>C. difficile</i>: SpoIVA, which is conserved in all spore-forming organisms, and SipL, which is conserved only in the Clostridia. Both SpoIVA and SipL are essential for heat-resistant spore formation and directly interact through SipL's C-terminal LysM domain. In this study, we demonstrate that the LysM domain is critical for SipL and SpoIVA function, likely by helping recruit SipL to the forespore during spore morphogenesis. We further identified residues within the LysM domain that are important for binding SpoIVA and thus functional spore formation. These findings provide important insight into the molecular mechanisms controlling the assembly of infectious <i>C. difficile</i> spores."
30690357,nosocomial,"In 2016, the Austrian Agency for Health and Food Safety started a pilot project to investigate antimicrobial resistance in surface water. Here we report on the characterisation of carbapenem resistant and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae isolates from Austrian river water samples compared to 95 clinical isolates recently obtained in Austrian hospitals. Ten water samples were taken from four main rivers, collected upstream and downstream of major cities in 2016. For subtyping and comparison, public core genome multi locus sequence typing (cgMLST) schemes were used. The presence of AMR genes, virulence genes and plasmids was extracted from whole genome sequence (WGS) data. In total three ESBL-producing strains and two carbapenem resistant strains were isolated. WGS based comparison of these five water isolates to 95 clinical isolates identified three clusters. Cluster 1 (ST11) and cluster 2 (ST985) consisted of doublets of carbapenem resistant strains (one water and one clinical isolate each). Cluster 3 (ST405) consisted of three ESBL-producing strains isolated from one water sample and two clinical specimens. The cities, in which patient isolates of cluster 2 and 3 were collected, were in concordance with the water sampling locations downstream from these cities. The genetic concordance between isolates from river water samples and patient isolates raises concerns regarding the release of wastewater treatment plant effluents into surface water. From a public health perspective these findings demand attention and strategies are required to minimize the spread of multiresistant strains to the environment."

30689004,nosocomial,"The main objective of this work is to investigate the impact of oral administration of ampicillin on the ecological balance of enterococci in the intestinal microbiota of rats during a treatment and a post-treatment. The results have showed that the treated animals excreted significantly higher percentages of resistant enterococci compared to the control group (P ≤ 0.05) during the treatment and after the treatment. The most predominant species selected after the treatment began were Enterococcus faecium. The MICs for ampicillin for all isolates of E. faecium were 32 to 64 µg/mL, with the exception of two strains (TR1LBMB, TR5LBMB), were found to be highly resistant (MICs ≥ 128 µg/mL). Quantification of ampicillin in faeces by the RT-HPLC showed that the significant increase in the number of ampicillin-resistant enterococci was associated with the gradual accumulation of high levels of unabsorbed ampicillin in the faeces. Our results suggest that ampicillin treatment can now be understood as a side effect contributing to the increase in the number of resistant Enterococcus strains, particularly E. faecium strains, recognized as important nosocomial pathogens."
30688429,nosocomial,"The growing number of patient morbidity related to nosocomial infections has placed an importance on the development of new antibacterial coatings for medical devices. Here, we utilize the versatile adhesion property of polydopamine (pDA) to design an antibacterial coating that possesses low-fouling and nitric oxide (NO) releasing capabilities. To demonstrate this, glass substrates were functionalized with pDA via immersion in alkaline aqueous solution containing dopamine, followed by the grafting of low-fouling polymer (polyethylene glycol (PEG)) via Michael addition, and subsequent formation of N-diazeniumdiolate functionalities (NO precursors) by purging with NO gas. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) confirmed the successful grafting of PEG and formation of N-diazeniumdiolate on polydopamine-coated substrates. NO release from the coating was observed over two days and the NO loading is tuneable by the pDA film thickness. The antibacterial efficiency of the coatings was assessed using Gram-negative Pseudomonas aeruginosa (i.e., wild type PAO1 and multidrug-resistant PA37) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213). The NO releasing PEGylated pDA film inhibited biofilm attachment by 96% and 70% after exposure to bacterial culture solution for 24 and 36 h, respectively. In contrast, films that do not contain NO failed to prevent biofilm formation on the surfaces at these time points. Furthermore, this coating also showed 99.9%, 97% and 99% killing efficiency against surface-attached PAO1, PA37 and S. aureus bacteria. Overall, the combination of low-fouling PEG and antibacterial activity of NO in pDA films makes this coating a potential therapeutic option to inhibit biofilm formation on medical devices."

The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of monocytes immune response in terms of cytokines produced after inoculation with different MRSA clones. Thirty-one clinical MRSA strains were selected on the basis of clonal types, accessory gene regulator (agr) groups and toxin genes carriage. Isolates were identified as <i>S. aureus</i> by Gram stain, catalase, coagulase production and PCR for <i>nuc</i> gene. The presence of <i>mecA</i>, <i>lukS/lukF-PV</i> (Panton-Valentine Leukocidin) and <i>tst</i> (Toxic Shock Syndrome Toxin-1) genes, as well as, the determination of <i>agr</i> groups was performed by PCR. Clonality was investigated by means of multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with live bacterial cells for 45 min at a ratio of 1:10.

The levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNFa), IL-1b, IL-8, IL-6, IL-12p40, IL-10, interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and IL-2, were measured by Human Cytokine Multiplex Immunoassay kit. Thirteen strains were <i>tst</i> and 12 <i>lukS/lukF-PV</i>-positive. Seven strains belonged to ST80 and ST225, five to ST30 and ST239, while the remaining seven isolates were grouped together as ""other."" Strains belonging to ST80 induced statistically lower levels of TNFa, IL-1b, IL-8, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ, and IL-2. PVL-positive strains classified into ST80 clone induced statistically lower concentrations of most cytokines as compared to PVL-positive strains belonging to other clones, <i>tst</i>-positive strains and toxin-negative ones. Strains of <i>agr</i>3 group belonging to ST80 induced statistically lower concentrations of most tested cytokines as compared to <i>agr</i>3 strains not-belonging to ST80, <i>agr</i>2 or <i>agr</i>1.

Bacteriophages (also called ""phages"") could be used as a potential alternative therapy to meet the challenges posed by such pathogens. Endolysins from phages have also been attracting increasing interest as potential antimicrobial agents. Here, we isolated 14 phages against <i>A. baumannii</i>, determined the lytic spectrum of each phage, and selected one with a relatively broad host range, named vB_AbaP_PD-6A3 (PD-6A3 for short), for its biological characteristics. We over-expressed and purified the endolysin (Ply6A3) from this phage and tested its biological characteristics. The PD-6A3 is a novel phage, which can kill 32.4% (179/552) of clinical multidrug resistant <i>A. baumannii</i> (MDRAB) isolates. Interestingly, <i>in vitro</i>, this endolysin could not only inhibit <i>A. baumannii</i>, but also that of other strains, such as <i>Escherichia coli</i> and methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA). We found that lethal <i>A. baumannii</i> sepsis mice could be effectively rescued <i>in vivo</i> by phage PD-6A3 and endolysin Ply6A3 intraperitoneal injection.

The vagina serves as a host environment for many microorganisms, contributing greatly to its defensive mechanisms. It is not known whether the introduction of other microorganisms into the vaginal region are detrimental or require intensive preventative measures. Several national ultrasonography societies, as well as the Israel Ministry of Health, have addressed the proper and adequate handling of sonographic endovaginal probes, including the use of high-level disinfecting agents following cleansing and prior to using probe covers between patients. However, many obstetrics and gynecology ultrasound units in Israel find it difficult to adhere to these strict disinfecting requirements. While most of the guidelines are based on the theoretical risk of contaminations when ultrasound endovaginal probes are used, the rate of nosocomial infections linked to the use of these probes has yet to be verified. Based on the information available, there is an urgent need to find a solution that enables gynecological ultrasound users to properly disinfect endovaginal probes between patients.

30684026,nosocomial,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which is a clinically important representative of Pseudomonas spp., has been recognized as causative agent of severe nosocomial infections worldwide. An increase in antibiotic resistance of P. aeruginosa clinical strains could be attributed to their capacity to acquire resistance through mobile genetic elements such as mobile integrons that are present in one-half of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains. Mobile class 1 integrons are recognized as genetic elements involved in the rapid dissemination of multiple genes encoding for antibiotic resistance. The LexA protein is a major repressor of integrase transcription, but differences in transcription regulation among bacterial species have also been noted. In this study, the promoter activity of class 1 integron integrase gene (intI1) and its variant lacking the LexA binding site in Pseudomonas putida WCS358 wild type, ΔrpoS and ΔpsrA was analysed. The results show that the activity of the intI1 gene promoter decreased in the rpoS and psrA mutants in the stationary phase of growth compared to the wild type, which indicates the role of RpoS and PsrA proteins in the positive regulation of integrase transcription. Additionally, it was determined that the activity of the lexA gene promoter decreased in ΔrpoS and ΔpsrA, and thus, we propose that PsrA indirectly regulates the intI1 gene promoter activity through regulation of lexA gene expression in co-operation with some additional regulators. In this study, intI1 gene expression was shown to be controlled by two major stress response (SOS and RpoS) regulons, which indicates that integrase has evolved to use both systems to sense the cell status."

Nevertheless, certain HBV variants are not detected in the routine serological tests in the Egyptian dialysis units owing to the mutations that change important viral antigens (Ag). In addition, these mutations result in the appearance of different HBV variants with different clinical forms. Thus, the present study aimed to assess different clinical forms of HBV infections and viral genotypes among HD patients in Ismailia governorate. To this end, serum samples were collected from 150 HD-patients and screened for HBV-DNA using nested PCR technique. Subsequently, positive samples were screened for the HBV serological markers (HBcAb, HBsAg, HBsAb, HBeAg and HBeAb) using ELISA and the HBV viral load was detected by qPCR. HBV genotypes were detected by direct sequencing of the partial surface (S) gene. The most common clinical form of HBV among our study cohort was the overt HBV infection (10%); followed by the seropositive occult hepatitis B infection (7.3%), most of whom were with an isolated HBcAb; while the least common form was the precore mutant (1.3%). All HBV isolates were genotype D. This study reveals the importance of HBcAb and PCR in the screening of HBV, especially for the detection of occult hepatitis B infection."

Here, we evaluated MALDI-TOF MS for discrimination of hospital outbreak-related clusters of Serratia marcescens and carbapenemase-producing Citrobacter freundii. Thirty-three S. marcescens isolates collected from neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) patients, and 23 C. freundii isolates including VIM-positive isolates from a hospital colonization outbreak were measured by Vitek MS. Consensus spectra of each isolate were clustered using SARAMIS software. Genotyping was performed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS). First, a set of 21 S. marcescens isolates from 2014 with seven genotypes including three monoclonal clusters was used for the evaluation of MALDI-TOF typing. MS clustering was largely in agreement with genotyping results when the similarity cut-off for clonal identity was set on 90%. MALDI-TOF cluster analysis was then investigated for the surveillance of S. marcescens in the NICU in 2017 and demonstrated the introduction of new strains into the hospital and nosocomial transmissions. MS analysis of the C. freundii outbreak in 2016 revealed a monoclonal cluster of VIM-positive isolates and the separation of epidemiologically non-related VIM-positive and negative isolates. Two additional VIM-positive Citrobacter isolates from food samples were closely related to the large monoclonal cluster. WGS confirmed the MS results. MALDI-TOF MS may be used as a first-line typing tool for S. marcescens and C. freundii to detect transmission events in the hospital because isolates of an identical WGS type were grouped into the same MS cluster."

Besides pain management, the supplemental role of LAs as antimicrobial agents has been documented in several studies. Different databases including PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science with the name of different local anesthetics and related names for antimicrobial keywords were searched without time limitation. This review summarized different in vitro and in vivo studies regarding antimicrobial effects of different LAs with focuses on antimicrobial applications of most studied LAs, interaction with different agents which combined with LAs, and mechanisms of action and structural dependence of LAs antibacterial effects. Among different LAs, lidocaine is the most studied preparation. Reduction of the incidence of endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection, prophylaxis for surgical wound infections, prevention of the incidence of catheter-associated infections, oral biofilm reduction on the buccal mucosa, and prevention against bacteria that produced nosocomial infection are some examples of lidocaine antimicrobial application. Studies showed that different factors including structure, concentration, duration of exposure, type of microorganism tested, and temperature affect the degree of LA antimicrobial activity. In addition, various agents such as antibiotics, preservatives, opioids, epinephrine, and propofol can combine with LAs and affect their antimicrobial properties through synergistic or antagonistic action. Due to antibacterial activities, LAs could be applied in a clinic for prophylaxis of surgical site infection. In the application of LAs prior to diagnostic procedures caution should be needed; otherwise, when culturing the specimen, they could lead to false negative results."

The antimicrobial efficiency of the obtained materials was screened against a large spectrum of reference and clinical microbial strains, both susceptible and exhibiting resistance phenotypes of clinical and epidemiological interest, in planktonic and biofilm state. Their biocidal activity is strongly dependent of material's characteristics and target microorganism. One of the most valuable findings of our study is the good antibiofilm activity of the obtained nanostructures, which in some cases was superior to that noted against planktonic cells, despite the well-known high tolerance of biofilm-embedded cells to different stressor agents. Another important finding is the excellent efficiency against three Gram-negative, respectively Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae and two Gram-positive species, i.e. Staphylococcus aureus and Enteroccus faecium included in the ESKAPE list of the most dangerous resistant pathogens, requiring global surveillance and urgent need for the development of novel antimicrobial agents.

Here, we conducted a cross-sectional study including 348 male farmers with different fluoride exposure levels from drinking water in Henan province of China to explore effects of fluoride exposure and ESRα genetic variation on serum SHBG and ABP levels. We found serum SHBG levels in male farmers from the high exposure group to be lower than those of the low exposure group. We also found that concentrations of SHBG affected ABP levels. Furthermore, fluoride exposure and single nucleotide polymorphisms at the XbaI and rs3798577 loci of the ESRα gene affected serum ABP levels. Our findings suggest that chronic fluoride exposure from drinking water is associated with alterations of serum SHBG and ABP concentrations in local male farmers and that the effect of fluoride exposure on ABP levels vary depending on ESRα gene polymorphisms."

Screening on the Vitek 2 Compact system (bioMérieux Inc., USA) was done to characterize bacterial isolates. Of the 60 samples collected from three hospitals, 38 (63.3%) were positive with 38 bacterial isolates (4 Gram-negative and 34 Gram-positive bacteria). We found 38.3% of cell phones were contaminated with coagulase-negative staphylococci, particularly <i>Staphylococcus epidermidis</i> (10 isolates). Other bacterial agents identified were <i>S. aureus</i>, <i>S. hominis</i>, <i>Alloiococcus otitis</i>, <i>Vibrio fluvialis</i>, and <i>Pseudomonas stutzeri</i>. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that most coagulase-negative staphylococci were resistant to benzylpenicillin, erythromycin, and rifampicin. Eight isolates were resistant to oxacillin, specifically <i>S. epidermidis</i> (3), <i>S. hominis</i> (2), and <i>S. warneri</i> (2). <i>A. otitis</i>, a cause of acute otitis media showed multidrug resistance.

Quaternization of the tertiary amines with six different alkyl bromides resulting in twelve amphiphilic cationic species of which killing efficacy increased with increasing alkyl chain length for all ten microorganisms. The octyl functionalized compound was chosen for suspension polymerizations of MMA because of the good compromise between killing and emulsifying properties. Aqueous poly(methacrylate) suspensions were stable and showed excellent killing properties."

30672296,nosocomial,"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a multi-drug resistant human pathogen largely involved in nosocomial infections. Today, effective antibacterial agents are lacking. Exploring the bacterial physiology at the post-translational modifications (PTM) level may contribute to the renewal of fighting strategies. Indeed, some correlations between PTMs and the bacterial virulence, adaptation, and resistance have been shown. In a previous study performed in P. aeruginosa, we reported that many virulence factors like chitin-binding protein CbpD and elastase LasB were multiphosphorylated. Besides phosphorylation, other PTMs, like those occurring on lysine, seem to play key roles in bacteria. In the present study, we investigated for the first time the lysine succinylome and acetylome of the extracellular compartment of P. aeruginosa by using a two-dimensional immunoaffinity approach. Some virulence factors were identified as multimodified on lysine residues, among them, LasB and CbpD. Lysine can be modified by a wide range of chemical groups. In order to check the presence of other chemical groups on modified lysines identified on LasB and CbpD, we used 1- and 2- dimensional gel electrophoresis approaches to target lysine modified by 7 other modifications: butyrylation, crotonylation, dimethylation, malonylation, methylation, propionylation, and trimethylation. We showed that some lysines of these two virulence factors were modified by these 9 different PTMs. Interestingly, we found that the PTMs recovered on these two virulence factors were different than those previously reported in the intracellular compartment."

30671349,nosocomial,"Nosocomial infections are a major threat to modern therapeutics. The major causative agent of these infections is multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, which impart high morbidity and mortality rate. This has led to an urge for the development of new antibiotics. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy is a promising strategy to which till date no resistant strain has been reported. Since the efficacy of photodynamic therapy largely depends on the selection and administration of an appropriate photosensitizer, therefore, the realization of clinically active photosensitizers is an immediate need. Here, by using <i>E. coli</i> as a study model we have demonstrated the antimicrobial photodynamic potential of riboflavin. Intracellular ROS formation by DCFH-DA assay, lipid peroxidation, protein carbonylation, LDH activity was measured in treated bacterial samples. Enzymatic (SOD, CAT, GSH) antioxidants and non-enzymatic (GSH) was further evaluated. Bacterial death was confirmed by colony forming assay, optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The treated bacterial cells exhibited abundant ROS generation and marked increment in the level of oxidative stress markers as well as significant reduction in LDH activity. Marked reduction in colony forming units was also observed. Optical microscopic and SEM images further confirmed the bacterial death. Thus, we can say that photoilluminated riboflavin renders the redox status of bacterial cells into a compromised state leading to significant membrane damage ultimately causing bacterial death. This study aims to add one more therapeutic dimension to photoilluminated riboflavin as it can be effectively employed in targeting bacterial biofilms occurring on hospital wares causing several serious medical conditions."

A total of 323 cancer patients were enrolled and analyzed from 2012 to 2018. Among the isolates, the species most frequently isolated was <i>C. parapsilosis</i> (37.15%, 120/323), and <i>C. albicans</i> only accounted for 34.37%. Based on statistical analysis, when candidemia patients who had <i>C. parapsilosis</i> were compared with other <i>Candida spp</i>., the following factors were found to be significantly associated with <i>C. parapsilosis</i> fungemia: parenteral nutrition (p < 0.001), neutropenia (p < 0.001), receipt of chemotherapy (p = 0.002), and previous antifungal use (p < 0.001). Parenteral nutrition was a factor that independently predicted <i>C. parapsilosis</i> candidemia (OR, 0.183; 95% CI, 0.098-0.340; p < 0.001).In short, <i>C. parapsilosis</i> as the leading non-albicans <i>Candida spp</i>. isolates in candidemia are posing a major threat for cancer patients. The study highlights the urgent need to evaluate the possibility of development of <i>C. parapsilosis</i> candidemia in cancer patients exposed to these risk factors effective and prevention strategies against this causative agent transmitted through nosocomial route should be implemented."
30671029,nosocomial,"<i>Acinetobacter baumannii</i> currently represents one of the most important nosocomial infection agent due to its multidrug-resistance and a propensity for the epidemic spread. The <i>A. baumannii</i> strains belonging to the international clonal lineages I (IC I) and II (IC II) are associated with the hospital outbreaks and a high virulence. However, the intra and inter lineage-specific features of strains belonging to these most worldwide spread <i>A. baumannii</i> clones are not thoroughly explored. In this study we have investigated a set of cell surface-related features of <i>A. baumannii</i> IC I (<i>n</i> = 20) and IC II (<i>n</i> = 16) lineage strains, representing 30 distinct pulsed-field gel electrophoresis types in the collection of clinical isolates obtained in Lithuanian tertiary care hospitals. We show that <i>A. baumannii</i> IC II strains are non-motile, do not form pellicle and display distinct capsular polysaccharide profile compared with the IC I strains. Moreover, in contrast to the overall highly hydrophobic IC I strains, IC II strains showed a greater variation in cell surface hydrophobicity. Within the IC II lineage, hydrophilic strains demonstrated reduced ability to form biofilm and adhere to the abiotic surfaces, also possessed twofold thicker cell wall and exhibited higher resistance to desiccation. Furthermore, these strains showed increased adherence to the lung epithelial cells and were more virulent in nematode and mouse infection model compared with the hydrophobic IC II strains. According to the polymerase chain reaction-based locus-typing, the reduction in hydrophobicity of IC II strains was not capsule or lipooligosaccharide locus type-dependent. Hence, this study shows that the most widespread <i>A. baumannii</i> clonal lineages I and II markedly differ in the series of cell surface-related phenotypes including the considerable phenotypic diversification of IC II strains at the intra-lineage level. These findings suggest that the genotypically related <i>A. baumannii</i> strains might evolve the features which could provide an advantage at the specific conditions outside or within the host."
30670619,nosocomial,"<i>Clostridium perfringens</i> type F strains cause a common human foodborne illness and many cases of nonfoodborne human gastrointestinal diseases. Sporulation plays two critical roles during type F enteric disease. First, it produces broadly resistant spores that facilitate type F strain survival in the food and nosocomial environments. Second, production of <i>C. perfringens</i> enterotoxin (CPE), the toxin responsible for causing the enteric symptoms of type F diseases, is restricted to cells in the process of sporulation. While later steps in the regulation of <i>C. perfringens</i> sporulation have been discerned, the process leading to phosphorylation of Spo0A, the master early regulator of sporulation and consequent CPE production, has remained unknown. Using an insertional mutagenesis approach, the current study identified the orphan histidine kinase CPR0195 as an important factor regulating <i>C. perfringens</i> sporulation and CPE production. Specifically, a CPR0195 null mutant of type F strain SM101 made 10<sup>3</sup>-fold fewer spores than its wild-type parent and produced no detectable CPE. In contrast, a null mutant of another putative <i>C. perfringens</i> orphan histidine kinase (CPR1055) did not significantly affect sporulation or CPE production. Studies using a <i>spoIIA</i> operon promoter-driven reporter plasmid indicated that CPR0195 functions early during sporulation, i.e., prior to production of sporulation-associated sigma factors. Furthermore, <i>in vitro</i> studies showed that the CPR0195 kinase domain can autophosphorylate and phosphorylate Spo0A. These results support the idea of CPR0195 as an important kinase that initiates <i>C. perfringens</i> sporulation by directly phosphorylating Spo0A. This kinase could represent a novel therapeutic target to block <i>C. perfringens</i> sporulation and CPE production during type F disease.<b>IMPORTANCE</b><i>Clostridium perfringens</i> type F enteric diseases, which include a very common form of food poisoning and many cases of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, develop when type F strains sporulate and produce <i>C. perfringens</i> enterotoxin (CPE) in the intestines. Spores are also important for transmission of type F disease. Despite the importance of sporulation for type F disease and the evidence that <i>C. perfringens</i> sporulation begins with phosphorylation of the Spo0A transcriptional regulator, the kinase phosphorylating Spo0A to initiate sporulation and CPE production had not been ascertained. In response, the current report now provides identification of an orphan histidine kinase named CPR0195 that can directly phosphorylate Spo0A. Results using a CPR0195 null mutant indicate that this kinase is very important for initiating <i>C. perfringens</i> sporulation and CPE production. Therefore, the CPR0195 kinase represents a potential target to block type F disease by interfering with intestinal <i>C. perfringens</i> sporulation and CPE production."

In Europe, ceftazidime-avibactam is also approved for the treatment of Gram-negative infections with limited treatment options. Selection and validation of the ceftazidime-avibactam dosage regimen was guided by an iterative process of population pharmacokinetic (PK) modelling, whereby population PK models for ceftazidime and avibactam were developed using PK data from clinical trials and updated periodically. These models were used in probability of target attainment (PTA) simulations using joint pharmacodynamic (PD) targets for ceftazidime and avibactam derived from preclinical data. Joint PTA was calculated based on the simultaneous achievement of the individual PK/PD targets (50% free time above the ceftazidime-avibactam minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for ceftazidime and free time above a critical avibactam threshold concentration of 1 mg/l for avibactam). The joint PTA analyses supported a ceftazidime-avibactam dosage regimen of 2,000 + 500 mg every 8 h by 2-h intravenous infusion for patients with creatinine clearance (CrCL) >50 ml/min across all approved indications and modified dosage regimens for patients with CrCL ≤50 ml/min. Subgroup simulations for individual Phase III patients showed that the dosage regimen was robust, with high target attainment (>95%) against MICs ≤8 mg/l achieved regardless of older age, obesity, augmented renal clearance or severity of infection. This review summarizes how the approved ceftazidime-avibactam dosage regimens were developed and validated using PK/PD targets, population PK modeling, and PTA analyses."

The turn-over numbers, k<sub>cat</sub><sup>obs</sup> , for interactions with these substrates were calculated to be 5.5, 6.3, and 0.2 s<sup>-1</sup> , respectively. The crystal structure of the α<sub>2</sub> form of P. aeruginosa ProRS was solved to 2.60 Å resolution. The amino acid sequence and X-ray crystal structure of P. aeruginosa ProRS was analyzed and compared with homologs in which the crystal structures have been solved. The amino acids that interact with ATP and proline are well conserved in the active site region and overlay of the crystal structure with ProRS homologs conforms to a similar overall three-dimensional structure. ProRS was developed into a screening platform using scintillation proximity assay (SPA) technology and used to screen 890 chemical compounds, resulting in the identification of two inhibitory compounds, BT06A02 and BT07H05.

The skin microbiome is conditioned by the individual physiological characteristics and anatomical microenvironments. Furthermore, it is important to separate the autochthonous resident microbiota from the transitory microbiota that we can acquire after interactions with contaminated surfaces. Two players participate in the hand-to-hand bacterial transmission process: the bacteria and the person. The particularities of the bacteria have been extensively studied, identifying some genera or species with higher transmission efficiency, particularly those linked to nosocomial infections and outbreaks. However, the human factor remains unstudied, and intrapersonal particularities in bacterial transmission have not been yet explored. Herein we summarize the current knowledge on hand-to-hand bacterial transmission, as well as unpublished results regarding interindividual and interindividual transmission efficiency differences. We designed a simple <i>in vivo</i> test based on four sequential steps of finger-to-finger contact in the same person artificially inoculated with a precise bacterial inoculum. Individuals can be grouped into one of three observed transmission categories: high, medium, and poor finger-to-finger transmitters. Categorization is relevant to predicting the ultimate success of a human transmission chain, particularly for the poor transmitters, who have the ability to cut the transmission chain.

It is assumed that isozymes have the same functional role for cells. Contrary to this assumption, we hypothesised that isozymes can confer different functions for microbial cells despite catalysing the same reactions. To test this hypothesis, we studied the role of superoxide dismutases (SOD) in Klebsiella pneumoniae, the causative agent of several nosocomial and community-acquired infections, in infection relevant assays. SODs are responsible for detoxification of toxic superoxide radicals. K. pneumoniae genome contains three superoxide dismutase genes, sodA, sodB, and sodC coding for Mn-, Fe- and CuZn- co-factored SODs, respectively. By creating and testing single, double, and triple SOD mutants, we investigated the regulatory interactions among SOD and determined the role of each isozyme in oxidative stress resistance, biofilm formation, cell morphology, metabolism, and in vivo colonization and persistence.

Consequently, A. baumannii is frequently responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia in clinical settings. In order to develop an effective treatment strategy, understanding host-pathogen interactions during A. baumannii infection is crucial. Various A. baumannii virulence factors have been identified as targets of host innate pattern-recognition receptors, which leads to activation of downstream inflammasomes to develop inflammatory responses, and the recruitment of innate immune effectors against A. baumannii infection.

30648305,nosocomial,"Bacteria can cope with toxic compounds such as antibiotics by inducing genes for their detoxification.

We previously identified the multi drug resistance ABC transporter LieAB in Listeria monocytogenes, a Gram-positive bacterium that occurs ubiquitously in the environment, but also causes severe infections in humans upon ingestion. Expression of the lieAB genes is strongly induced in cells lacking the PadR-type transcriptional repressor LftR, but compounds leading to relief of this repression in wild type cells were not known. Using RNA-Seq and promoter-lacZ fusions we demonstrate highly specific repression of the lieAB and lftRS promoters through LftR. Screening of a natural compound library yielded the depsipeptide aurantimycin A - synthesized by the soil-dwelling Streptomyces aurantiacus - as the first known naturally occurring inducer of lieAB expression. Genetic and phenotypic experiments concordantly show that aurantimycin A is a substrate of the LieAB transporter and thus, lftRS and lieAB represent the first known genetic module conferring and regulating aurantimycin A resistance.
