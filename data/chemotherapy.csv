30726940,chemotherapy,Ensuring the quality and effectiveness of counselling is imperative for enabling people living with HIV to cope with treatment adherence. Countrywide assessment of antiretroviral therapy (ART) centres was undertaken to assess the quality and effectiveness of counselling. The insights gained from the assessment are expected to build an improved understanding of the counselling aspect and contribute to informing decisions strengthening the counselling provided at ART centres.
30726934,chemotherapy,"Therapeutic administration of glucocorticoids (GC) is frequently used as add-on chemotherapy for palliative purposes during breast cancer treatment. Recent studies have shown that glucocorticoid treatment induces microRNA-708 in ovarian cancer cells, resulting in impaired tumor cell proliferation and metastasis. However, the regulatory functions of glucocorticoids on miR-708 and its downstream target genes in human breast cancer cells (BCCs) are poorly understood. In this study, we found that treatment with either the synthetic glucocorticoid Dexamethasone (DEX) or the natural glucocorticoid mimic, Antcin A (ATA) significantly increased miR-708 expression by transactivation of glucocorticoid receptor alpha (GRα) in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human BCCs. Induction of miR-708 by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) agonists resulted in inhibition of cell proliferation, cell-cycle progression, cancer stem cell-like phenotype and metastasis of BCCs. In addition, GR agonist treatment or miR-708 mimic transfection remarkably inhibited IKKβ expression and suppressed NF-κB activity and its downstream target genes, including COX-2, cMYC, cyclin D1, MMP-2, MMP-9, CD24, CD44 and increased p21CIP1 and p27KIP1 that are known to be involved in proliferation, cell-cycle progression, metastasis and cancer stem cell marker protein. Breast cancer cells xenograft models indicate that treatment with GR agonists significantly reduced tumor growth, weight and volume. Overall, our data strongly suggest that GR agonists induced miR-708 and downstream suppression of NF-κB signaling which may be applicable as a novel therapeutic intervention in breast cancer treatment."

30726834,chemotherapy,"We assessed the efficacy and safety of weekly cyclophosphamide-bortezomib-dexamethasone (CBD) induction prior to autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) in newly diagnosed Japanese patients with multiple myeloma (MM). This regimen consisted of four 28-day cycles of once-weekly oral cyclophosphamide (300 mg/m2), subcutaneous bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2), and oral dexamethasone (40 mg). Responding patients underwent stem cell collection followed by ASCT. The primary endpoint was the postinduction rate of achieving a near complete response (nCR) or better. Among the 38 enrolled patients, a complete response (CR), an nCR, a very good partial response (VGPR), and a partial response (PR) were achieved in 10.5, 2.6, 23.7, and 36.8% of cases, respectively. A grade 4 hematological adverse event (AE) was observed in 1 patient. Grade 3-4 infection, including febrile neutropenia, was observed in 4 patients (10.5%). Although 2 patients dropped out due to AE, 94.7% of the patients completed the induction phase. However, because of a poor response to induction chemotherapy (<PR in 6 patients), poor stem cell mobilization (4 patients), and a protocol violation (1 patient), only 24 patients (63.2%) proceeded to ASCT. The 2-year progression-free and overall survivals were 55.3 and 82.7%, respectively. We thus believe that the therapeutic power of weekly CBD is not strong enough as a 3-drug induction regimen despite its feasibility for most Japanese patients."
30726822,chemotherapy,"Our patient was diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase (CP) when he was 40 years old. Although dasatinib (DAS) was prescribed during his clinical course, he was poorly compliant with the treatment. In November 20XX, at 65 years of age, he visited our hospital with leukocytosis. He was diagnosed with CML in CP and recommenced DAS at 50 mg/day, achieving a complete hematological response after 2 months. However, DAS was increased to 100 mg/day because only minimum cytogenetic response was evident even after 9 months, but CML progressed to the accelerated phase after 18 months. The ABL kinase domain mutations T315I and F317L were detected. Ponatinib (PON) was not yet approved, and he declined allogeneic stem cell transplantation therapy. He commenced interferon-α (IFN-α) in addition to DAS, and the F317L mutation (only) disappeared after 7 months; the patient achieved a major cytogenetic response. In January 20XX＋4, he commenced PON monotherapy (the drug was approved by this time) and achieved a major molecular response after 8 months. The T315I mutation disappeared during PON therapy. Although IFN-α is rarely used in the treatment of CML, this case suggests that IFN-α should be re-considered in patients with CML who exhibit tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance."

For this cross-sectional study, a simulated patient method was applied in 562 selected community pharmacies of Punjab, Pakistan. A scenario for the metformin oral therapy was developed that illustrates direct counseling for adult diabetic patients. Counseling and communication skills were also assessed. Descriptive statistics and chi-square tests were used for analysis. Only 29.4% of simulated patients received medication counseling directly; 47.6% received it on request. About 32.8% of clients were referred to a physician without counseling. The most frequently provided information was dietary instruction (94.8%) and dose of therapy (84.5%). Only one quarter (25.3%) of simulated patients were asked about disease duration and similar rate (25.0%) was found for discussions of special warnings. The side effects, drug storage, drug-drug interactions and duration of therapy were ignored. Minimal information was provided about other medication during therapy (0.2%) and effect of medicine withdrawal (2.7%). About 59.5% simulated patients were instructed for compliance to medication. Counseling to type 2 diabetic patients in Pakistani community pharmacies is not very satisfactory. Pharmacies' staff have little focus on counseling. Professional training of staff could improve counseling and communication skills."

A 77-year-old female with marked thrombocytosis of 1,024×10<sup>9</sup>/L was tentatively diagnosed with essential thrombocythemia in 2011, and the thrombocytosis was controlled using hydroxycarbamide and low-dose busulfan. In 2016, the leukocyte count increased to a peak value of 68.8×10<sup>9</sup>/L (86.6% mature neutrophils) during platelet-reduction therapy. Bone marrow aspirate exhibited hypercellularity with ring sideroblasts comprising 41.5% erythroblasts without excess myeloblasts. Cytogenetic examination demonstrated the JAK2 V617F mutation and chromosomal abnormality of 46,XX,del(20)(q1?). Furthermore, dysplastic features of erythroid and granuloid precursors, as well as many large atypical megakaryocytes, were observed. Further genetic examinations revealed the SF3B1 K700E mutation, but not amplification of the JAK2 gene or pathogenic mutations in the 13 other genes examined. A diagnosis of MDS/MPN with RS-T was established and hyperleukocytosis was controlled using a higher dose of hydroxycarbamide. Although the patient maintained a stable disease state, she became RBC transfusion-dependent. Hyperleukocytosis, regardless of chemotherapy, is rare and may be novel in this disorder."
30726735,chemotherapy,"Adaptive drug-resistance mechanisms allow human tumors to evade treatment through selection and expansion of treatment-resistant clones. Here, studying clonal evolution of tumor cells derived from human pancreatic tumors, we demonstrate that in vitro cultures and in vivo tumors are maintained by a common set of tumorigenic cells that can be used to establish clonal replica tumors (CRTs), large cohorts of animals bearing human tumors with identical clonal composition. Using CRTs to conduct quantitative assessments of adaptive responses to therapeutics, we uncovered a multitude of functionally heterogeneous subpopulations of cells with differential degrees of drug sensitivity. High-throughput isolation and deep characterization of unique clonal lineages showed genetic and transcriptomic diversity underlying functionally diverse subpopulations. Molecular annotation of gemcitabine-naive clonal lineages with distinct responses to treatment in the context of CRTs generated signatures that can predict the response to chemotherapy, representing a potential biomarker to stratify patients with pancreatic cancer."
30726709,chemotherapy,"The canonical effect of Pregnane X Receptor (PXR, NR1I2) agonism includes enhanced hepatic uptake and a concomitant increase in the first-pass metabolism and efflux of drugs in mammalian liver and intestine. In patients undergoing combination therapy, PXR-mediated gene regulation represents the molecular basis of numerous food-drug, herb-drug, and drug-drug interactions. Moreover, PXR activation promotes chemotherapeutic resistance in certain malignancies. Additional research efforts suggest that sustained PXR activation exacerbates the development of fatty liver disease. Additional metabolic effects of PXR activation in liver are the inhibition of fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenesis. The identification of non-toxic and selective PXR antagonists is therefore of current research interest. Inhibition of PXR should decrease adverse effects, improve therapeutic effectiveness, and advance clinical outcomes in patients with cancer, fatty liver, and diabetes. This review identifies small molecule PXR antagonists described to date, discusses possible molecular mechanisms of inhibition, and seeks to describe the likely biomedical consequences of the inhibition of this nuclear receptor superfamily member."

30726670,chemotherapy,"Aggregation behavior of proteins on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) has been extensively studied for its promising applications in biosensing, bioimaging, photodynamic therapy, drug delivery, etc. In this work, we studied adsorption kinetics of an antimicrobial protein, REG3A (regenerating islet-derived protein 3-alpha), on the surface of as-synthesized citrate-capped AuNPs under the influence of lipopolysaccharides (LPSs), with a combined method of UV-vis spectroscopy, multivariate analysis, and molecular dockings. In the AuNPs-REG3A binary system a component with the ""up-and-down"" signal was detected by the in-depth data analysis on the time-resolved spectroscopic data, corresponding with the protein agglomeration and exfoliation observed in the TEM (Transmission Electron Microscopy) and AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy) experiments. Intriguingly, LPSs can rescue the spectral oddity - the adsorption pattern in the AuNPs-REG3A-LPS ternary system becomes normal and similar to a typical single-layer mode as in our previous study of the serum albumin - AuNP system (Spectroscopy letters, 2016, 49, 434-443). The following-up molecular modeling suggests that LPS molecules mainly interact with three segments of REG3A amino acid sequence, i.e. P109-T110-Q111-G112, P115-N116, and P137-S138-T139. The latter two protein-ligand interactions impair the REG3A-REG3A protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the two subunits (E114-P115-N116-G117-E118 and N136-P137-S138-T139-I140). Thus, our results elucidate the LPS inhibitory effect on fibrous protein self-aggregation at the AuNP surface and the molecular dockings give a plausible mechanism to rationalize the competition among protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions.

30725543,chemotherapy,"  Background          Adherence to statins is often sub-optimal and declines over time. Direct costs incurred by patients are frequently cited as responsible for inadequate statin adherence. To determine whether survivors of ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), who benefit from low or no cost drug dispensation, have optimal long-term adherence to statins, we aimed to evaluate the ten-year adherence to statin of these patients. Methods          The AMI-QUEBEC Study follows a cohort of STEMI survivors hospitalized at 17 hospitals in Quebec, Canada during the year 2003. We obtained their 10-year data on lipid lowering therapy (LLT) consumption. Optimal adherence was defined as the proportion of days covered of ≥80%. We used multivariate logistic regression to determine factors independently associated with optimal adherence to statins. Results          Complete 10-year data on statin dispensation was available for 524 patients. Optimal adherence remained stable over time at 80% and more during the 10-year follow-up period. During the last five years, 12% of patients did not use any LLT. Older age, living in less socially deprived areas, concomitant use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and admission to hospitals with percutaneous coronary interventions facilities (PCI-hospitals) were associated with improved statin adherence.   Conclusion Future studies are needed to explore the potential factors associated with concomitant use of ACEI/ARB, and admission to PCI-hospitals that may have optimized statin adherence. Socially deprived patients may benefit from more support and encouragement to enhance their long-term statin adherence."

30725446,chemotherapy,"A 44- and a 66-year-old woman underwent nasopancreatic drainage (NPD) to treat obstructive pancreatitis secondary to a pancreatic metastasis from lung cancer. Both patients were diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer and underwent chemotherapy for 17 and 15 months, respectively. Abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomography revealed a solid pancreatic tail tumor measuring 2.5 cm and 1.3 cm in diameter, respectively. Additionally, we observed dilatation of the upstream main pancreatic duct (MPD) and edematous parenchyma with peripancreatic inflammatory changes limited to the pancreatic tail. Both patients were diagnosed with moderately severe acute pancreatitis and received fluid resuscitation, an opioid analgesic, antibiotics, and a protease inhibitor. However, owing to unrelenting pain, we performed endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for pancreatic duct drainage in both patients. ERCP showed a stricture in the MPD in the pancreatic tail with upstream dilatation. A 5-Fr NPD tube was inserted to drain the dilated MPD, and cloudy pancreatic juice was drained. NPD tube placement led to pain relief in both patients. Pancreatic juice cultures grew Enterococcus faecium and Enterobacter cloacae, respectively. The NPD tube was later cut in both cases using a pair of scissor forceps."
30725426,chemotherapy,"The elevated methionine (MET) requirement of cancer cells is termed MET dependence and is possibly the only known general metabolic defect in cancer. Targeting MET by recombinant methioninase (rMETase) can arrest the growth of cancer cells in vitro and in vivo due to their elevated requirement for MET. rMETase can also potentiate chemotherapy drugs active in S phase due to the selective arrest of cancer cells in S/G<sub>2</sub> phase during MET restriction (MR). We previously reported that rMETase, administrated by intraperitoneal injection (ip-rMETase), could inhibit tumor growth in mouse models of cancer including patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models. We subsequently compared ip-rMETase and oral rMETase (o-rMETase) on a melanoma PDOX mouse model. o-rMETase was significantly more effective than ip-rMETase to inhibit tumor growth without overt toxicity. The combination of o-rMETase+ip-rMETase was significantly more effective than either monotherapy and completely arrested tumor growth. Thus, o-rMETase is effective as an anticancer agent with the potential of clinical development for chronic cancer therapy as well as for cancer prevention. o-rMETase may also have potential as an antiaging agent for healthy people, since MR has been shown to extend the life span of a variety of different organisms."
30725415,chemotherapy,"This chapter reviews how total methionine (MET) restriction (MR) of a human brain tumor xenograft, effected by the combination of recombinant L-methionine-α-deamino-γ-lyase (rMETase) and a MET-free diet, greatly potentiates standard chemotherapy for brain tumors in mouse models. The growth of human brain tumor Daoy, SWB77, and D-54 xenografts in nude mice was arrested after the depletion of mouse plasma methionine (MET) with a combination of an MR diet and rMETase and homocysteine to rescue normal cells and tissues. MET was depleted to below 5 μm by this treatment. MR for 10-12 days inhibited tumor growth, but did not prevent tumor regrowth after treatment cessation. A single dose of N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea (BCNU), which was ineffective alone, was administered at the end of the MR regimen, and caused a more than 80-day growth delay for Daoy and D-54 and a 20-day growth delay for SWB77. The total MR treatment regimens also increased the efficacy of temozolomide (TMZ) against the SWB77 xenograft when administered at the end of the MET regimen."
30725414,chemotherapy,"Methionine (MET) is a general target in cancer due to the excess requirement of MET by cancer cells. MET has been effectively restricted by recombinant methioninase (rMETase) in mouse models of cell-line tumors. This chapter reviews the efficacy of rMETase on patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) mouse models of human cancer. Ewing's sarcoma is a recalcitrant disease even though development of multimodal therapy has improved patients' outcome. A Ewing's sarcoma was implanted in the right chest wall of nude mice to establish a PDOX model. rMETase effectively reduced tumor growth compared to the untreated control. The MET level both of plasma and supernatants derived from sonicated tumors was lower in the rMETase treatment group. Body weight did not significantly differ at any time points between the two groups. A PDOX nude mouse model of a BRAF V600E-mutant melanoma was established in the chest wall of nude mice and also tested with rMETase in combination with a first-line melanoma drug, temozolomide (TEM). Combination therapy of TEM and rMETase was significantly more efficacious than either monotherapy. The results reviewed in this chapter demonstrate the clinical potential of rMETase."
30725413,chemotherapy,"Cancer cells are methionine (MET) dependent compared to normal cells as they have an elevated requirement for MET in order to proliferate. MET restriction selectively traps cancer cells in the S/G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle. The cell cycle phase can be visualized by color coding with the fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) is an enzyme that effectively degrades MET. rMETase induces S/G<sub>2</sub>-phase blockage of cancer cells which is identified by the cancer cells' green fluorescence with FUCCI imaging. Cancer cells in G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> are the majority of the cells in solid tumors and are resistant to the chemotherapy. Treatment of cancer cells with standard chemotherapy drugs only led to the majority of the cancer cell population being arrested in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase, identified by the cancer cells' red fluorescence in the FUCCI system. The G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase cancer cells are chemo-resistant. Tumor targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (S. typhimurium A1-R) was used to decoy quiescent G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> stomach cancer cells growing in nude mice to cycle, with subsequent rMETase treatment to selectively trap the decoyed cancer cells in S/G<sub>2</sub> phase, which made them highly sensitive to chemotherapy. Subsequent cisplatinum (CDDP) or paclitaxel (PTX) chemotherapy was then administered to kill the decoyed and trapped cancer cells, which completely prevented or regressed tumor growth. In a subsequent experiment, a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of recurrent CDDP-resistant metastatic osteosarcoma was eradicated by the combination of Salmonella typhimurium A1-R decoy, rMETase S/G<sub>2</sub>-phase cell cycle trap, and CDDP cell kill. Salmonella typhimurium A1-R and rMETase pre-treatment thereby overcame CDDP resistance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new chemotherapy paradigm of ""decoy, trap, and kill"" chemotherapy."
30725411,chemotherapy,"Methionine (MET) restriction (MR) has been shown to arrest cancer growth and sensitizes tumors to chemotherapy. MR total parenteral nutrition (MR TPN) with a chemotherapy-containing amino acid solution (""AO-90"") (lacking both MET and L-cysteine[CYS]) showed synergistic effects with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) in tumor-bearing rats and in a Phase I clinical trial with gastrointestinal tract cancers compared to 5-FU in a MET-containing TPN. All gastric cancer patients underwent gastrectomy. Resected tumors in the AO-90 group showed significant reduction of cancer histologically, while almost no effect was seen in the control group. A Phase II clinical trial of dietary MR combined with cystemustine treatment for melanoma or glioma was carried out. Twenty-two patients (20 with metastatic melanoma and 2 with recurrent gloma) received a median of four cycles of the combination of a 1-day MR diet with cystemustine (60 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) every 2 weeks. This combination was well tolerated (toxicity and nutritional status). The median disease-free survival was 1.8 months and the median survival was 4.6 months, with two long-duration stabilizations. MET depletion in plasma was 40%. In another study, eight patients with a variety of metastatic solid tumors were enrolled in a Phase I clinical trial of a commercially available MR medical food. Participants remained on the experimental diet for an average of 17.3 weeks. Plasma methionine levels fell from 21.6 to 9 μm within 2 weeks, a 58% decline. The only side effect was weight loss of approximately 0.5 kg per week. A feasibility study combining dietary MR with a FOLFOX regimen in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer was carried out. The plasma MET concentration was reduced by dietary MR by 58% on the first day of the MR diet. Among the four patients evaluable for response, three experienced a partial response and one patient had disease stabilization. The results of the above-described clinical trials indicate the clinical potential of MR."
30725410,chemotherapy,"The elevated methionine (MET) requirement for the growth of tumors, first observed by Sugimura in 1959, termed MET dependence, is a potentially highly effective therapeutic target. Proof of this principle is that when MET restriction (MR) was initially established in co-cultures of cancer and normal cells, MET dependence could be exploited to selectively kill cancer cells without killing co-cultured normal cells. MET-dependent cells become reversibly blocked in the late S/G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle under MR enabling selective and effective S-phase chemotherapy against these blocked cancer cells. Subsequent MET repletion with an anti-mitotic drug was totally effective at selectively eliminating the MET-dependent cancer cells enabling the normal MET-dependent cells to take over the culture. We have also observed that the MET analog ethionine (ETH) is synergistic with MR in arresting the growth of the Yoshida sarcoma both in vitro and eliminating metastasis when transplanted to nude mice. MR increased the efficacy of cisplatinum (CDDP) against the MX-1 human breast carcinoma cell line when grown in nude mice. MR increased 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) efficacy on a human gastric cancer xenograft, SC-1-NU, in nude mice. MET-restricted total parenteral nutrition (MR TPN) was effective in Yoshida sarcoma-bearing rats. MR TPN with doxorubicin (DOX) and vincristine (VCR) resulted in significant tumor suppression and prolonged survival of Yoshida-sarcoma-bearing rats. These results were the basis of subsequent studies that used methioninase to effect MR for effective cancer therapy."
30725407,chemotherapy,"Cancer cells require elevated amounts of methionine (MET) and arrest their growth under conditions of MET restriction (MR). This phenomenon is termed MET dependence. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) first indicated that the MET-dependent SV40-transformed cancer cells were arrested in the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle when under MR. This is in contrast to a G<sub>1</sub>-phase accumulation of cells, which occurs only in MET-supplemented medium at very high cell densities and which is similar to the G<sub>1</sub> cell-cycle block which occurs in cultures of normal fibroblasts at high density. When the human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell line was cultured in MET-free, homocysteine-containing (MET<sup>-</sup>HCY<sup>+</sup>) medium, there was an extreme increment in DNA content without cell division indicating that the cells were blocked in S phase. Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) treatment of cancer cells also selectively trapped cancer cells in S/G<sub>2</sub>: The cell cycle phase of the cancer cells was visualized with the fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). At the time of rMETase-induced S/G<sub>2</sub>-phase trap, identified by the cancer cells' green fluorescence by FUCCI imaging, the cancer cells were administered S-phase-dependent chemotherapy drugs, which interact with DNA or block DNA synthesis such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and which were highly effective in killing the cancer cells. In contrast, treatment of cancer cells with drugs in the presence of MET, only led to the majority of the cancer cell population being blocked in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase, identified by the cancer cells becoming red fluorescent in the FUCCI system. The G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> blocked cells were resistant to the chemotherapy. MR has the potential for highly effective cell-cycle-based treatment strategy for cancer in the clinic."
30725388,chemotherapy,"Background Given the increasing number of available immunotherapeutic agents, more patients are presenting after failing immunotherapy in need of new treatment options. In this study, we investigated the clinical outcomes of patients treated with sequential immunotherapy. Methods We performed a retrospective review of 90 advanced stage cancer patients treated on immunotherapy-based phase 1 clinical trials at Winship Cancer Institute from 2009 to 2017. We included 49 patients with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)-indicated histology. Patients were analyzed based on whether they had received prior ICI. Clinical outcomes were overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), and clinical benefit (best response of complete response, partial response, or stable disease). Univariate analysis (UVA) and multivariate analysis (MVA) were performed using Cox proportional hazard or logistic regression model. Covariates included age, liver metastases, number of prior lines of therapy, histology, and Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) risk group. Results The most common histologies were melanoma (61%) and lung/head and neck cancers (37%). More than half of patients (n = 27, 55%) received at least one ICI prior to trial enrollment: ten received anti-PD-1, two received anti-CTLA-4, five received anti-PD-1/CTLA-4 combination, and ten received multiple ICI. In MVA, ICI-naïve patients had significantly longer OS (HR: 0.22, CI: 0.07-0.70, p = 0.010) and trended towards higher chance of CB (HR: 2.52, CI: 0.49-12.97, p = 0.268). Patients who received prior ICI had substantially shorter median OS (10.9 vs 24.3 months, p = 0.046) and PFS (2.8 vs. 5.1 months, p = 0.380) than ICI-naïve patients per Kaplan-Meier estimation. Within the ICI-naïve group, 78% (7 of 9) of patients who received prior interleukin (IL-2) or interferon gamma (IFNγ) experienced disease control for at least 6 months, compared to a disease control rate of 15% (2 of 13) in patients who had received chemotherapy, targeted therapy, or no prior treatment. Conclusions ICI-naïve patients may experience improved clinical outcomes on immunotherapy-based phase 1 clinical trials than patients who have received prior ICI. This may be particularly true for patients who received prior IL-2 or IFNγ. Further development of immunotherapy combination therapies is needed to improve clinical outcomes of these patients. These results should be validated in a larger study."

Immune infiltration is the most consistent predictive marker for chemotherapy response and improved prognosis in TNBC. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the immune microenvironment differs between AA and Caucasian patients."
30725351,chemotherapy,"It has been well established that radiation-induced gastrointestinal injury is manifested through loss of intestinal crypt stem cells and disruption of the mucosal layers, resulting in diarrhoea, weight loss, electrolyte imbalance, infection and mortality. Podophyllotoxin and rutin in combination (G-003M) has been reported to regulate endogenous cellular antioxidant defense systems and inflammatory response. However, the mechanism by which G-003M ameliorates radiation-induced intestinal stem cell (ISC) injury remains unclear. Here, we hypothesize the radioprotective potential of G-003M would amplify the intestinal crypt stem cells through upregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and accelerate the reconstitution of the irradiated intestine. Our results showed significant functional and structural intestine regeneration in irradiated animals following G-003M treatment which resulted in improved animal survival. Immunohistochemical examination revealed an enhancement in Lgr5<sup>+ ve</sup> crypt stem cells. Increased β-catenin nuclear translocation resulted in upregulation of β-catenin target genes that supported ISC renewal and expansion in G-003M-treated mice, as compared to IR-treated mice. However, G-003M could not rescue the Wnt knockdown cohorts (XAV939 treated) which exhibited greater incidence of intestinal apoptosis, DNA damage and crypt depopulation upon radiation exposure. These findings suggest the involvement of Wnt pathway during G-003M mediated amelioration of IR-induced ISC injury. G-003M also minimised acute inflammation by restricting the infiltration of immune cells into the intestinal venules. Furthermore, G-003M treated animals showed improved anti-tumor response compared to FDA approved Amifostine. Taken together, our findings suggest that G-003M may be used as a potential countermeasure for radiation injuries as well as an adjuvant during anti-cancer therapy."

30725252,chemotherapy,"Acute brain dysfunction and the following neurological manifestation are common complications in septic patients, which are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. However, the therapeutic strategy of this disorder remains a major challenge. Given the emerging role of a clinically approved drug, probenecid (PRB) has been recently identified as an inhibitor of pannexin 1 (PANX1) channel, which restrains extracellular ATP release-induced purinergic pathway activation and inflammatory response contributing to diverse pathological processes. In this study, we explored whether PRB administration attenuated neuroinflammatory response and cognitive impairment during sepsis. In mice suffered from cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis, treatment with PRB improved memory retention and lessened behavioral deficits. This neuroprotective effect was coupled with restricted overproduction of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-6, and interleukin (IL)-1β in the hippocampus. Since this damped neuroinflammation was replicated by inhibition of ATP release, it suggested that PANX1 channel modulates a purinergic-related pathway contributing to the neurohistological damage. Therefore, we identified PRB could be a promising therapeutic approach for the therapy of cerebral dysfunction of sepsis."

30725206,chemotherapy,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)-programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) axis have shown promising results in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, some of them with persistent responses to these agents that form a population of long-term survivors. Despite the variable definition of PD-L1 positivity in tumors, an association between expression and response has been reasonably consistent in advanced NSCLC. In addition, the clinical efficacy of ICIs seems to be related to the genomic landscape of the tumor in terms of mutational burden and clonal neoantigens. Furthermore, increasing evidence shows that excessive activation of the immune response elicited by ICIs, leading to immune-related toxicities, might be associated with an improved response to immunotherapy. There are still many unanswered questions about the proper use of these agents to maximize their efficacy, which may be improved through combination with radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapies, or other immune mediators, including dual checkpoint blockade. To search for clues for addressing these challenges, this review focused on the characteristics and clinical features of long-term NSCLC survivors and the potential biomarkers of response to ICIs."
30725156,chemotherapy,"An emerging trend in the medical literature, including the Rheumatology literature, is that of accumulating large, multicentric, multi-national data based on registries of patients seen in real life situations. Such real-world evidence (RWE) may help provide valuable insights into the long-term outcomes of disease in unselected patients seen in daily practice, including patients belonging to vulnerable populations such as extremes of age, during pregnancy and lactation. Evidences gathered from real life practice settings can help understand drug prescription patterns, including adherence to treatment guidelines, cost-effectiveness of therapy, and real-life long-term outcomes, and adverse effects of treatment with particular medications. Registry-based data also helps analyze comorbidities in patients with rheumatic diseases, and their impact on quality of life, morbidity and mortality. Traditionally, a randomized controlled trial (RCT), or systematic reviews of multiple, homogenous RCTs, have been considered the cornerstone of evidence-based medicine, and RWE does, at times, provide differing viewpoints from the results of particular drugs in clinical trial settings. Therefore, in the present day, it is prudent to consider the complementary nature of information derived from RWE to that obtained from rigorous, clinical trial settings. Future guidelines for disease management may consider it relevant to include information from RWE in addition to that available from clinical trials, to help devise management guidelines that are harmonious with routine practice settings."
30725116,chemotherapy,"Women with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) are generally treated by chemotherapy but their responsiveness may be blunted by DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. We previously reported that IGFBP-3 forms nuclear complexes with EGFR and DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs) to modulate DSB repair by non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) in TNBC cells. To discover IGFBP-3 binding partners involved in chemoresistance through stimulation of DSB repair, we analyzed the IGFBP-3 interactome by LC-MS/MS and confirmed interactions by coimmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assay. Functional effects were demonstrated by DNA end-joining in vitro and measurement of γH2AX foci. In response to 20 µM etoposide, the DNA/RNA-binding protein, non-POU domain-containing octamer-binding protein (NONO) and its dimerization partner splicing factor, proline/glutamine-rich (SFPQ) formed complexes with IGFBP-3, demonstrated in basal-like TNBC cell lines HCC1806 and MDA-MB-468. NONO binding to IGFBP-3 was also shown in a cell-free biochemical assay. IGFBP-3 complexes with NONO and SFPQ were blocked by inhibiting EGFR with gefitinib or DNA-PKcs with NU7026, and by the PARP inhibitors veliparib and olaparib, which also reduced DNA end-joining activity and delayed the resolution of the γH2AX signal (i.e. inhibited DNA DSB repair). Downregulation of the long noncoding RNA in NHEJ pathway 1 (LINP1) by siRNA also blocked IGFBP-3 interaction with NONO-SFPQ. These findings suggest a PARP-dependent role for NONO and SFPQ in IGFBP-3-dependent DSB repair and the involvement of LINP1 in the complex formation. We propose that targeting of the DNA repair function of IGFBP-3 may enhance chemosensitivity in basal-like TNBC, thus improving patient outcomes."

30724690,chemotherapy,"Understanding of the mechanism for myeloid differentiation provides important insights into the hematopoietic developmental processes. By using an ESC-derived myeloid progenitor cell model, we found that CSF2/GM-CSF triggered macrophage differentiation and activation of the MTOR signaling pathway. Activation or inhibition of the MTOR signaling enhanced or attenuated macrophage differentiation, respectively, suggesting a critical function. We further showed that macroautophagy/autophagy was inhibited with the addition of CSF2. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition and genetic modification of autophagy enhanced macrophage differentiation and rescued the inhibitory effect on differentiation caused by MTOR inhibition. Thus, the MTOR signaling pathway regulates macrophage differentiation of myeloid progenitors by inhibiting autophagy. Our results provide new insights into the mechanisms for myeloid differentiation and may prove useful for therapeutic applications of hematopoietic and myeloid progenitor cells."
30724647,chemotherapy,"The use of antimuscarinic drugs is common in the management of the overactive bladder (OAB). Concerns have been raised over their use in the elderly population in whom the use of these drugs is highly prevalent, consequent to the reported link between these drugs and cognitive impairment and dementia. Areas covered: Recent publications have heightened concerns regarding antimuscarinic drug use in the elderly. In this review, the author discusses the available evidence upon which conclusions have been based and has presented the need for cortical review and need for caution in interpreting the data. The available evidence is inconsistent, differences in pharmacokinetics have not been widely recognized in clinical trials, clinical estimation of antimuscarinic activity has not been standardized, and serum antimuscarinic activity has not been found to correlate with cognitive impairment. Furthermore, the significant heterogeneity within cognitive aging processes raises questions regarding the extent to which various factors, including medication, influences this process. Expert opinion: Whilst caution should indeed be exercised in the use of antimuscarinic medication in the elderly, advocacy of discontinuation of their use may deprive patients of the benefits of improved quality of life from treatment where currently alternative management remain limited or invasive."

The preoperative diagnosis of ULMS is challenging for the physicians, as the symptoms of these tumors are often vague and nonspecific. Moreover, as ULMS have an aggressive biologic behavior, affected women frequently have very poor prognosis. Areas covered: The aim of this review is to describe the current pharmacotherapy for ULMS, including the ongoing clinical trials. Expert opinion: Surgery is the standard treatment for patients with early-stage ULMS. In this setting, the role of adjuvant therapies is still unclear. In the case of advanced, persistent, or recurrent ULMS, chemotherapy is the standard care with the most frequently used drug being doxorubicin. As the outcomes for patients with the currently available conventional single or combined regimens are far from being satisfactory, new alternative and innovative medical compounds have or are being evaluated. Recently, pazopanib, and olaratumab, two innovative targeted drugs, have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating advanced soft-tissue sarcoma, including ULMS.

The multifunctional Au-LTSL-GA.A, a self-assembled thermal nanomaterial, was used in antibacterial and anticancer applications in combination with near-infrared (NIR) irradiation. The designed Au-LTSL-GA.A nanoparticle was used as a nano-photosensitizer to achieve synergistic photochemotherapy based on the phototherapy sensitization property of Au nanorods (NRs) and antitumour activity of GA.A. In the antibacterial experiments, the Au-LTSL-GA.A + NIR irradiation had a broad-spectrum antibacterial effect, exhibiting a strong antibacterial activity against drug-resistant Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) compared with the raw GA.A and LTSL-GA.A. In the anticancer experiments, Au-LTSL-GA.A + NIR irradiation, which combined phototherapy sensitization property of Au NRs with antitumour activity of GA.A, exhibited high anticancer activity against MCF-7 cells. The IC<sub>50</sub> value of Au-LTSL-GA.A + NIR irradiation (12.1 ± 1.3 μg/mL) was almost similar to cisplatin in MCF-7 cells. The evaluation of the potential in vivo toxicity of Au-LTSL-GA.A revealed no toxicity in mice. The results of this study suggest that Au-LTSL-GA.A has a wide range of potential industrial and clinical applications, such as in antibacterial treatment and cancer photochemotherapy."
30724426,chemotherapy,"Inhibition of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6-retinoblastoma (RB) pathway is an effective therapeutic strategy against cancer. Here, we performed a preclinical investigation of the antitumor activity of SHR6390, a novel CDK4/6 inhibitor. SHR6390 exhibited potent antiproliferative activity against a wide range of human RB-positive tumor cells in vitro, and exclusively induced G<sub>1</sub> arrest as well as cellular senescence, with a concomitant reduction in the levels of Ser780-phosphorylated RB protein. Compared with the well-known CDK4/6 inhibitor, palbociclib, orally administered SHR6390 led to equivalent or improved tumor efficacy against a panel of carcinoma xenografts, and produced marked tumor regression in some models, in association with sustained target inhibition in tumor tissues. Furthermore, SHR6390 overcame resistance to endocrine therapy and HER2-targeting antibody in ER-positive and HER2-positive breast cancer, respectively. Moreover, SHR6390 combined with endocrine therapy exerted remarkable synergistic antitumor activity in ER-positive breast cancer. Taken together, our findings indicate that SHR6390 is a novel CDK4/6 inhibitor with favorable pharmaceutical properties for use as an anticancer agent. This article is protected by copyright.

30724380,chemotherapy,"Doxorubicin (DOX) is the most commonly used anticancer drug; however, it has limited use because prolonged administration may result in severe cardiotoxicity. Simvastatin (SIM), generally prescribed for hypercholesterolemia, has also shown salubrious results in the monotherapy or combinational drug therapy of different cancers in various models. Nanoparticle drug delivery systems are a novel way of improving therapeutics and also improve the absorption and specificity of drugs towards tumor cells. In this study, we exploited this technology to increase drug specificity and minimize imminent adverse effects. In this study, the antitumor activity of the combination formulas of DOX and SIM, either loaded in water (DOX-SIM-Solution) or nanoemulsions (NEs) (DOX-SIM-NE), was evaluated in a Swiss albino mouse model of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma. The anticancer effect was assessed by quantifying the change in body weight, mean survival time, and percent increase in lifespan (%ILS), determining haematological and serum biochemical parameters (liver function test, kidney function test and lipid profile parameters) as well as studying the histopathological alterations in liver tissues. We observed a clear increase in %ILS of the DOX-SIM-Solution group (265.30) that was double the %ILS of the DOX-SIM-NE group (134.70). However, DOX-SIM-NE had a non-toxic effect on the haematological parameters, whereas DOX-SIM-Solution increased the levels of haemoglobin and lymphocytes. Furthermore, the encapsulation of SIM and DOX into NEs improved the levels of all serum biochemical parameters compared to the DOX-SIM-Solution. A reduction in the side effects of DOX-SIM-NE on the liver was also established using light microscopy, which revealed that the morphologies of the hepatocytes of the mice were less affected by administration of the DOX-SIM-NE treatment than with the DOX-SIM-Solution treatment. The study showed that incorporating SIM into the DOX-loaded-NE formulation remarkably improved its efficiency and simultaneously reduced its adverse effects. This article is protected by copyright.

30724288,chemotherapy,"Ovarian cancer is often diagnosed at a late stage, when disease has spread to extra-pelvic regions such as the omentum. There are limited treatment options available for women with extensive disease and tumours often relapse after current chemotherapy regimens. Therefore, novel drugs should be investigated for the treatment of ovarian cancer. A 3D organotypic model of ovarian cancer can provide a specific platform for the evaluation of nano-drugs. Using patient derived primary cells, the 3D model mimics the ovarian metastatic microenvironment allowing efficient and reproducible testing of many nanoparticles. Dichlororuthenium(ii) (p-cymene) (1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane) (RAPTA-C) conjugated fructose-micelles have been used as the promising nano-drug for the treatment of metastatic cancer.

30724283,chemotherapy,"The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is one of the most important organelles controlling myriads of cellular functions including protein folding/misfolding/unfolding, calcium ion homeostasis and lipid biosynthesis. Subsequently, due to its functional dysregulation in cancer cells, it has emerged as an interesting target for anti-cancer therapy. However, specific targeting of the ER in cancer cells remains a major challenge due to the lack of ER-selective chemical tools. Furthermore, for performing multiple cellular functions the ER is dependent on the nucleus through complicated cross-talk. Herein, we have engineered a supramolecular self-assembled hexameric rosette structure from two small molecules: tri-substituted triazine and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU). This rosette structure consists of an ER-targeting moiety with a fluorescence tag, an ER-stress inducer and a nuclear DNA damaging drug simultaneously, which further self-assembled into an ER-targeting spherical nano-scale particle (ER-NP). These ER-NPs internalized into HeLa cervical cancer cells by macropinocytosis and specifically localized into the ER to induce ER stress and DNA damage leading to cell death through apoptosis. Interestingly, ER-NPs initiated autophagy, inhibited by a combination of ER-NPs and chloroquine (CQ) to augment cancer cell death. This work has the potential to exploit the concept of supramolecular self-assembly into developing novel nano-scale materials for specific sub-cellular targeting of multiple organelles for future anti-cancer therapy."
30724113,chemotherapy,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) remains an important cause of serious infection, for which vancomycin is often recommended as the first-choice antibiotic treatment. Appropriate vancomycin prescribing requires accurate measurement of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) to avoid treatment failure, and yet determination can be challenging due to methodological difficulties associated with susceptibility testing. An International Working Group of infectious disease specialists and clinical/medical microbiologists reached a consensus that empirical MRSA infection therapies should be chosen regardless of the suspected origin of the infecting strain (e.g., community or hospital) due to the complex intermingling epidemiology of MRSA clones in these settings. Also, if an elevated vancomycin MIC in the susceptible range is obtained in routine testing, an alternative second method should be used for confirmation and to aid antibiotic therapy recommendations. There is no absolutely dependable method for the accurate determination of vancomycin MIC, but broth microdilution appears to be the most reliable."

The engineered OVA-HBc nanocages (OVA-HBc NCs), displaying high density repetitive array of epitopes in a limited space by self-assembling into symmetrical structure, can not only induce bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDC) maturation effectively, but also be enriched in the draining lymph nodes. Naïve C57BL/6 mice immunized with OVA-HBc NCs are able to generate significant and specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. Moreover, OVA-HBc NCs as a robust nanovaccine can trigger preventive antitumor immunity and significantly delay tumor growth. When combined with a low-dose chemotherapy drug (paclitaxel), OVA-HBc NCs could specifically inhibit progression of established tumor. Our findings support HBc-based nanocages with modularity and scalability are an attractive nanoplatform for combination cancer immunotherapy."
30724027,chemotherapy,"Although the application of multiple chemotherapy brought revolutionary changes to improve overall survival of osteosarcoma patients, the existence of multidrug resistance (MDR) has become a great challenge for successful osteosarcoma treatment in recent decades. Substantial studies have revealed various underlying mechanisms of MDR in cancers. As for osteosarcoma, evidence has highlighted that microRNAs (miRNAs) can mediate in the processes of DNA damage response, apoptosis avoidance, autophagy induction, activation of cancer stem cells, and signal transduction. Besides, these drug resistance-related miRNAs showed much promise for serving as candidates for predictive biomarkers of poor outcomes and shorter survival time, and therapeutic targets to reverse drug resistance and overcome treatment refractoriness.

30723913,chemotherapy,"Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a key step in transdifferentiation process in solid cancer development. Forthcoming evidence suggest that the stratified program transforms polarized, immotile epithelial cells to migratory mesenchymal cells associated with enhancement of breast cancer stemness, metastasis, and drug resistance. It involves primarily several signaling pathways, such as transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), cadherin, notch, plasminogen activator protein inhibitor, urokinase plasminogen activator, and WNT/beta catenin pathways. However, current understanding on the crosstalk of multisignaling pathways and assemblies of key transcription factors remain to be explored. In this review, we focus on the crosstalk of signal transduction pathways linked to the current therapeutic and drug development strategies. We have also performed the computational modeling on indepth the structure and conformational dynamic studies of regulatory proteins and analyze molecular interactions with their associate factors to understand the complicated process of EMT in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Electrostatic potential surfaces have been analyzed that help in optimization of electrostatic interactions between the protein and its ligand. Therefore, understanding the biological implications underlying the EMT process through molecular biology with biocomputation and structural biology approaches will enable the development of new therapeutic strategies to sensitize tumors to conventional therapy and suppress their metastatic phenotype."

30723851,chemotherapy,"Traditional antibacterial treatments, such as chlorhexidine (CHX), destroy cariogenic biofilms. However, they exert negative effects in clinical applications, for example, teeth staining, taste disturbance and harm to oral tissue after a long-term exposure. Therefore, biocompatible strategies for efficient antibacterial drug delivery are in high demand. In this study, aimed at dental caries therapy enhancement, we designed a pH-responsive nanocarrier system, capable of releasing CHX in an acidic environment within cariogenic biofilms. Cationic poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(2-(((2-aminoethyl)carbamoyl)oxy)ethyl methacrylate) (PEG-b-PAECOEMA) was synthesized first. Modification of PAECOEMA by citraconic anhydride (CA) forms negatively charged PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA, which could assemble into core-shell polyionic complex micelles (PICMs) when mixed with cationic CHX via electrostatic interactions. PICMs are stable in healthy neutral oral microenvironments with CHX encapsulated in the core and PEG shell exposed. Once in acidic milieu within caries-producing biofilms, they rapidly disassemble and release CHX cargo owing to degradation of citraconic amide groups. Molecular structures of the above copolymers were confirmed using 1H NMR and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The pH-dependent degradation rates of citraconic amide in PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA copolymer were measured by fluorescamine method. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) studies confirmed successful assembly of well-defined spherical PICMs in aqueous solution. The disassembly of PICMs in acidic microenvironment was observed using dynamic light scattering (DLS). PICMs showed an obvious pH-dependent drug release profile when the pH changed from 7.4 to 5.5. More importantly, the micellar system could reduce drug toxicity of CHX and exhibited outstanding antibacterial capability in the biofilm of Streptococcus mutans. Micelles constructed from pH-sensitive PEG-b-PAECOEMA/CA are highly promising for dental caries therapy and provide guidelines for drug-delivery system design in other acidic pathologic systems."
30723782,chemotherapy,"Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) manifests primarily as early-onset emphysema caused by the destruction of the lung by neutrophil elastase due to low amounts of the serine protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT). The current therapy involves weekly intravenous infusions of AAT-derived from pooled human plasma that is efficacious, yet costly. Gene therapy applications designed to provide constant levels of the AAT protein are currently under development. The challenge is for gene therapy to provide sufficient amounts of AAT to normalize the inhibitor level and anti-neutrophil elastase capacity in the lung. One strategy involves administration of an adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy vector to the pleural space providing both local and systemic production of AAT to reach consistent therapeutic levels. This review focuses on the strategy, advantages, challenges, and updates for intrapleural administration of gene therapy vectors for the treatment of AATD."

30723707,chemotherapy,"Despite of remarkable progress made in the head and neck cancer (HNC) therapy, the survival rate of this metastatic disease remain low. Tailoring the appropriate therapy to patients is a major challenge and highlights the unmet need to have a good preclinical model that will predict clinical response. Hence, we developed an accurate and time efficient drug screening method of tumor <i>ex vivo</i> analysis (TEVA) system, which can predict patient-specific drug responses. In this study, we generated six patient derived xenografts (PDXs) which were utilized for TEVA. Briefly, PDXs were cut into 2 × 2 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup> explants and treated with clinically relevant drugs for 24 h. Tumor cell proliferation and death were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and TEVA score was calculated. <i>Ex vivo</i> and <i>in vivo</i> drug efficacy studies were performed on four PDXs and three drugs side-by-side to explore correlation between TEVA and PDX treatment <i>in vivo</i>. Efficacy of drug combinations was also ventured. Optimization of the culture timings dictated 24 h to be the time frame to detect drug responses and drug penetrates 2 × 2 × 2 mm<sup>3</sup> explants as signaling pathways were significantly altered. Tumor responses to drugs in TEVA, significantly corresponds with the drug efficacy in mice. Overall, this low cost, robust, relatively simple and efficient 3D tissue-based method, employing material from one PDX, can bypass the necessity of drug validation in immune-incompetent PDX-bearing mice. Our data provides a potential rationale for utilizing TEVA to predict tumor response to targeted and chemo therapies when multiple targets are proposed."
30723704,chemotherapy,"Ovarian cancer (OvCa) is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with two-thirds of patients having late-stage disease (II-IV) at diagnosis. Improved diagnosis and therapies are needed, yet preclinical animal models for ovarian cancer research have primarily been restricted to rodents, for data on which can fail to translate to the clinic. Thus, there is currently a need for a large animal OvCa model. Therefore, we sought to determine if pigs, being more similar to humans in terms of anatomy and physiology, would be a viable preclinical animal model for OvCa. We injected human OSPC-ARK1 cells, a chemotherapy-resistant primary ovarian serous papillary carcinoma cell line, into the neck muscle and ear tissue of four severe combined immune deficient (SCID) and two non-SCID pigs housed in novel biocontainment facilities to study the ability of human OvCa cells to form tumors in a xenotransplantation model. Tumors developed in ear tissue of three SCID pigs, while two SCID pigs developed tumors in neck tissue; no tumors were detected in non-SCID control pigs. All tumor masses were confirmed microscopically as ovarian carcinomas. The carcinomas in SCID pigs were morphologically similar to the original ovarian carcinoma and had the same immunohistochemical phenotype based on expression of Claudin 3, Claudin 4, Cytokeratin 7, p16, and EMA. Confirmation that OSPC-ARK1 cells form carcinomas in SCID pigs substantiates further development of orthotopic models of OvCa in pigs."
30723701,chemotherapy,"<b>Background:</b> Induction chemotherapy (IC) is a treatment option for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (LA SCCHN). However, treatment with docetaxel, cisplatin, and 5-FU (TPF) followed by cisplatin and radiotherapy is controversial because of toxicity concerns. The aim of this phase II study was to assess the feasibility of docetaxel, cisplatin, and cetuximab (TPEx) followed by cetuximab and concurrent radiotherapy for LA SCCHN. <b>Patients and Methods:</b> We enrolled patients with histological evidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx without distant metastases. IC comprised cisplatin (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) and docetaxel (75 mg/m<sup>2</sup>) on day 1, repeated every 3 weeks for up to three courses. Cetuximab was initiated at 400 mg/m<sup>2</sup>, followed by 250 mg/m<sup>2</sup> doses weekly until the end of radiotherapy. Radiotherapy (70 Gy/35 fr/7 w) was initiated after the last docetaxel administration. The primary endpoint was the rate of treatment completion. <b>Results:</b> We enrolled 54 patients (median age, 58 years) between August 2013 and October 2015. Our patients were 49 males and 5 females with hypopharyngeal (<i>n</i> = 28), oropharyngeal (<i>n</i> = 19), or laryngeal (<i>n</i> = 7) cancers, and 48 of them had stage IV disease. The overall response rate was 72.2% with a median follow-up of 36.1 months and a 3-year overall survival of 90.7%. The treatment completion rate was 76%; 50 patients (93%) received ≥2 courses of IC, and 41 (76%) completed radiotherapy. The frequencies of grade ≥3 febrile neutropenia or allergy/infusion reactions were 39% and 11%, respectively. There was one treatment-related death. <b>Conclusions:</b> IC with TPEx followed by cetuximab with concurrent radiotherapy showed acceptable compliance for the treatment of LA SCCHN. However, high frequency of febrile neutropenia remains a challenge and further improvement in the management of TPEx is necessary. <b>Trial Registration:</b> UMIN000009928."
30723695,chemotherapy,"Prognosis of patients with glioblastoma (GBM) remains dismal despite maximal surgical resection followed by aggressive chemo-radiation therapy. Almost every GBM, regardless of genotype, relapses as aggressive recurrent disease. Sensitization of GBM cells to chemo-radiation is expected to extend survival of patients with GBM by enhancing treatment efficacy. The PARP family of enzymes has a pleiotropic role in DNA repair and metabolism and has emerged as an attractive target for sensitization of cancer cells to genotoxic therapies. However, despite promising results from a number of preclinical studies, progress of clinical trials involving PARP inhibitors (PARPI) has been slower in GBM as compared to other malignancies. Preclinical <i>in vivo</i> studies have uncovered limitations of PARPI-mediated targeting of base excision repair, considered to be the likely mechanism of sensitization for temozolomide (TMZ)-resistant GBM. Nevertheless, PARPI remain a promising sensitizing approach for at least a subset of GBM tumors that are inherently sensitive to TMZ. Our PDX preclinical trial has helped delineate <i>MGMT</i> promoter hyper-methylation as a biomarker of the PARPI veliparib-mediated sensitization. In clinical trials, <i>MGMT</i> promoter hyper-methylation now is being studied as a potential predictive biomarker not only for response to TMZ therapy alone, but also PARPI-mediated sensitization of TMZ therapy. Besides the combination approach being investigated, IDH1/2 mutant gliomas associated with 2-hydroxygluterate (2HG)-mediated homologous recombination (HR) defect may potentially benefit from PARPI monotherapy. In this article, we discuss existing results and provide additional data in support of potential alternative mechanisms of sensitization that would help identify potential biomarkers for PARPI-based therapeutic approaches to GBM."
30723654,chemotherapy,"We report here a case of periosteal sarcoma in a 10-year-old female, along with quantitative values obtained with bone single photon emission computed tomography/computed tomography (SPECT/CT), which were useful to evaluate treatment response to preoperative chemotherapy. Pretreatment radiograph images of the lower leg showed cortical thickening eroded by a broad-based soft-tissue mass without the involvement of the underlying cortex, while computed tomography (CT) revealed a small juxtacortical mass with thick calcification and periosteal reaction. In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the mass showed hypointensity in the inner part and isointensity in the outer part in T1-weighted images, while the inner part showed hypointensity and the outer part hyperintensity in T2-weighted images. Bone SPECT/CT results indicated the focal and intense uptake of the mass. Following neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), radiograph and MRI results revealed a slight increase in size, with growing calcification. Although visual inspection of the bone SPECT/CT findings showed nearly the same amount of focal uptake, quantitative parameters determined with those findings were decreased, with maximum standardized uptake value (SUV), peak SUV, mean SUV, metabolic bone volume (MBV), and total bone uptake (TBU) reduced by -20.7%, -22.0%, -12.6%, -33.5%, and -41.9%, respectively. The excision biopsy at the surgery showed a pathological grade 1 (non-complete response) after NAC, including a more than 20% of cell necrosis part. The quantitative bone SPECT/CT was considered to reflect treatment response in this case."
30723653,chemotherapy,"Talc pleurodesis has been reported to increase fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake in the high attenuation areas of pleural thickening, making it difficult to distinguish between benign granulomatous inflammatory processes and malignancies, which may therefore interfere with the post-chemotherapy disease evaluation on FDG-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). We present two cases of malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with talc pleurodesis and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before pleurectomy/decortication in which post-NAC FDG-PET/CT showed intense FDG uptakes in the high attenuation areas of pleural thickening with false positive result, whereas post-NAC <sup>11</sup>C-choline PET/CT showed mild choline uptake of pleural talc deposit, which did not interfere with the post-chemotherapy disease evaluation. Thus we suggest choline-PET/CT may show little choline uptake to granulomatous inflammation and evaluate treatment response in malignant pleural mesothelioma patients treated with talc pleurodesis and NAC."
30723582,chemotherapy,"The treatment of breast cancer largely depends on the utilization of immunogenic chemotherapeutics, which, as a common leitmotif, stimulate the exposure of calreticulin (CALR) on the surface of cancer cells, thereby facilitating their recognition by dendritic cells for the uptake of tumor-associated antigens and subsequent antigen cross-presentation to cytotoxic T cells. Breast cancer cells also express the calreticulin antagonist CD47, which inhibits tumor cell phagocytosis and consequently subverts anticancer immune responses. Here, we treated carcinogen-induced or transplantable mouse models of cancer by a CD47 blocking antibody that was at least as efficient as chemotherapy and that could be favorably combined with the anthracycline mitoxantrone in the context of carcinogen-induced orthotopic breast cancers. Monotherapy by CD47 blockade led to a reduction in tumor growth and an increase in overall survival. Of note, this treatment lead to a moderate depletion of M2 macrophages as well as close-to-complete elimination of regulatory T cells from the tumor bed, suggesting a strong favorable impact of CD47 blockade on the tumor microenvironment."
30723561,chemotherapy,"We report a case of a 52-year-old female with a family history of pancreatic and colon cancers who presented with a right breast mass positive for high-grade medullar carcinoma with triple-negative biomolecular profile.

The patient underwent laparotomy performing optimal cytoreduction on bilateral ovarian tumors; the pathology and immunohistochemistry confirmed bilateral ovary adenocarcinoma with positive peritoneal malignancy. Due to her synchronic breast and ovarian cancers, a genetic profile was performed detecting a new pathogenic variant in the BRCA2 gene: c.3606_3607del (p.Ser1203Cysfs). She was given chemotherapy with carboplatin and paclitaxel obtaining complete clinical response. Regarding her breast cancer, she had a right modified radical mastectomy and prophylactic left mastectomy obtaining complete clinical response. This case presents with an unusual subtype and difficult histologic diagnosis of a synchronic medullar breast cancer and ovary carcinoma associated with a new mutation of the BRCA2 gene."
30723558,chemotherapy,"Ruxolitinib is increasingly being utilized for the treatment of myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, but the potential for hepatic toxicity is poorly understood. We performed a retrospective review of hepatic damage occurring in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms receiving ruxolitinib. Relevant histologic images of liver biopsies were reviewed by an experienced liver pathologist and reported to a multidisciplinary team including hepatology and hematology. A variety of liver pathology was observed including extramedullary hematopoiesis, obliterative portal venopathy, and drug-induced liver injury. In all cases reviewed, the liver biopsy had significant treatment implications. We conclude that hepatology referral and liver biopsy in patients receiving ruxolitinib therapy with biochemical evidence of liver injury reveals a variety of etiologies which have significant treatment impact. Clinicians should be aware of the potential causes of liver damage in this population and initiate prompt referral and liver biopsy."

30723502,chemotherapy,"Mutations in p53, especially gain of function (GOF) mutations, are highly frequent in lung cancers and are known to facilitate tumor aggressiveness. Yet, the links between mutant GOF-p53 and lung cancers are not well established. In the present study, we set to examine how we can better sensitize resistant GOF-p53 lung cancer cells through modulation of cellular protein degradation machineries, proteasome and autophagy. H1299 p53 null lung cancer cells were stably transfected with R273H mutant GOF-p53 or wild-type (wt) p53 or empty vectors. The presence of R273H-P53 conferred the cancer cells with drug resistance not only against the widely used chemotherapeutic agents like cisplatin (CDDP) or 5-flurouracil (5-FU) but also against potent alternative modes of therapy like proteasomal inhibition. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new strategies that can overcome GOF-p53 induced drug resistance and prolong patient survival following failure of standard therapies. We observed that the proteasomal inhibitor, peptide aldehyde N-acetyl-leu-leu-norleucinal (commonly termed as ALLN), caused an activation of cellular homeostatic machinery, autophagy in R273H-P53 cells. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) alone or in combination with ALLN failed to induce enhanced cell death in the R273H-P53 cells; however, in contrast, an activation of autophagy by serum starvation or rapamycin increased sensitivity of cells to ALLN-induced cytotoxicity. An activated autophagy was associated with increased ROS and ERK signaling and an inhibition of either ROS or ERK signaling resulted in reduced cytotoxicity. Furthermore, inhibition of GOF-p53 was found to enhance autophagy resulting in increased cell death. Our findings provide novel insights pertaining to mechanisms by which a GOF-p53 harboring lung cancer cell is better sensitized, which can lead to the development of advanced therapy against resistant lung cancer cells."
30723478,chemotherapy,"<b>Background:</b> Common variable immunodeficiency disorder (CVID) is one of the most frequent inborn errors of immunity, increased occurrence of malignancies, particularly lymphomas, and gastric cancers, has long been noted among CVID patients. Multifactorial etiology, including immune dysregulation, infections, chronic inflammation, or genetic background, is suggested to contribute to tumor development. Here, we present the results of the first Czech nationwide study focused on epidemiology, immunology and genetic background in a cohort of CVID patients who also developed tumors <b>Methods:</b> The cohort consisted of 295 CVID patients followed for 3,070 patient/years. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) was calculated to determine the risk of cancer, and Risk ratio (RR) was established to evaluate the significance of comorbidities. Moreover, immunophenotyping, including immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte populations, was assessed. Finally, Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in all patients with lymphoma to investigate the genetic background. <b>Results:</b> Twenty-five malignancies were diagnosed in 22 patients in a cohort of 295 CVID patients. SIR was more than 6 times greater in comparison to the general population. The most common neoplasias were gastric cancers and lymphomas. History of Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) was established as a potential risk factor, with over 3 times higher risk of cancer development. The B cell count at diagnosis of lymphoma was reduced in the lymphoma group; moreover, post-treatment B and T cell lymphopenia, associated with poorer outcome, was found in a majority of the patients. Intriguingly, no NK cell depression was observed after the chemotherapy. WES revealed heterogeneous genetic background among CVID patients with tumors, identifying gene variants associated with primary immunodeficiencies (such as CTLA4, PIK3CD, PMS2) and/or increased cancer susceptibility (including BRCA1, RABEP1, EP300, KDM5A). <b>Conclusions:</b> The incidence of malignancy in our CVID cohort was found to be more than 6 times greater compared to the general population. Gastric cancers and lymphomas were the most frequently diagnosed tumors. ITP was identified as a risk factor for malignancy in CVID patients. WES analysis confirmed a wide genetic heterogeneity among CVID patients. The identified causative or modifying gene variants pointed to errors in mechanisms contributing to both immunodeficiency and malignancy."
30723406,chemotherapy,"Isoniazid is a first-line anti-tuberculosis drug recommended for treatment of drug-susceptible <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> infections. Breast-feeding is not contra-indicated while undergoing isoniazid therapy, even though isoniazid was found to migrate into breast milk, leading to infant drug exposure. Exposure assessment of isoniazid in infants exposed to the drug via breast milk has so far not accounted for the polymorphic expression of the isoniazid metabolising enzyme <i>N</i>-acetyltransferase 2. The aim of this study was to re-visit the safety assessment of maternal isoniazid therapy for infants exposed to the drug via breast milk, while accounting for fast and slow metabolisers in the adult and infant population, as well as for slower metabolism in small infants than in adults. We applied a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modelling approach to estimate mother and infant external and internal drug exposure non-invasively. Validity of our PBPK models was confirmed through comparison of simulated results with experimental data. Highest recommended oral doses for mothers are daily 300 mg or 900 mg every 3 days. Simulation of maternal intake of 300 mg resulted in oral exposures of 0.58 (95%CI: 0.42-0.69) mg/day and 1.49 (1.22-1.50) mg/day for infants of fast and slow metabolising mothers, respectively. Oral exposures of infants within the first 24 h after maternal intake of 900 mg were 1.75 (1.25-2.06) mg/day and 4.46 (4.00-4.50) mg/day. Maximal drug concentrations in infant plasma ranged between 0.04 and 0.78 mg/L for the two dosing regimens. We therefore conclude that infant exposure to isoniazid via breast milk after maternal drug intake of highest recommended doses is very low. We expect that such low exposure levels most likely do not cause any clinically significant adverse effects in nursed infants."
30723405,chemotherapy,"Combination therapy based on nano-sized drug delivery system has been developed as a promising strategy by combining two or more anti-tumor mechanisms. Here, we prepared liver-targeted nanoparticles (GH-DPP) composed of 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-polyethylene glycol-polyetherimide (DSPE-PEG-PEI) with Glycyrrhetinic acid-modified hyaluronic acid (GA-HA) for co-delivery of doxorubicin (DOX) and Bcl-2 siRNA. Particles size, zeta potential and morphology were determined for the drug-loaded GH-DPP nanoparticles (siRNA/DOX/GH-DPP). Cellular uptake and <i>in vitro</i> cytotoxicity were analyzed against HepG2 cells. <i>In vivo</i> bio-distribution and anti-tumor therapeutic effects of siRNA/DOX/GH-DPP were evaluated in H22-bearing mice. The results showed that siRNA/DOX/GH-DPP nanoparticles were nearly spherical and showed dose-dependent cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells. Compared to Glycyrrhetinic acid-free co-delivery system (siRNA/DOX/DPP) and GH-DPP nanoparticles for delivery of DOX or Bcl-2 siRNA alone, siRNA/DOX/GH-DPP nanoparticles could induce more cellular apoptosis, and showed higher anti-tumor effect. Herein GH-DPP nanoparticles could simultaneously deliver both chemotherapy drugs and siRNA into the tumor region, exhibiting great potential in anti-tumor therapy."
30723315,chemotherapy,"Vincristine is an important drug of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) treatment protocols that can cause neurotoxicity. Patients treated with LAL/SHOP protocols often suffer from vincristine-related neurotoxicity in early phases of treatment. A genetic variant in CEP72, a gene involved in vincristine pharmacodynamics, was recently associated with neurotoxicity after prolonged vincristine treatment. This association was not replicated in our Spanish population during induction phase. To test the possibility that other variants in genes involved in vincristine pharmacodynamics were associated with vincristine neuropathy in early phases of the treatment, we evaluated the correlation with toxicity of 24 polymorphisms in 9 key genes in a large cohort of 152 Spanish children with B-ALL homogeneously treated. Results showed no association between any genetic variant in the TUBB1, TUBB2A, TUBB2B, TUBB3, TUBB4, MAPT, MIR146a, MIR202, and MIR411 genes and vincristine-related neurotoxicity. These results are in line with the hypothesis that there are different mechanisms causing pheripheral neurotoxicity after prolonged and short-term vincristine treatments."
30723293,chemotherapy,"Metaplastic breast carcinoma is a rare heterogeneous category of breast cancer, often associated with a poor prognosis. Clinical-pathologic studies with respect to varied morphologic subtypes are lacking. There is also a dearth of studies assessing the response of metaplastic breast carcinoma to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Cases of metaplastic breast carcinoma diagnosed between 2007 and 2017 were identified. Various clinical-pathologic variables were tested for association with survival. Patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy were assessed for pathologic response. Median age at diagnosis with metaplastic breast carcinoma was 64 years. With a median follow-up of 39 months, 26 patients (27%) recurred (24 distant and 2 loco-regional). The overall survival rate of the cohort was 66% (64/97). A number of variables were associated with survival in univariable analysis; however, in multivariable analysis, only lymph node status and tumor size (pT3 vs. pT1/2) were significantly associated with all survival endpoints: recurrence-free survival, distant recurrence-free survival, overall survival and breast cancer-specific survival. Twenty-nine of 97 (30%) patients with metaplastic breast carcinoma received neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Five (17%) patients achieved pathologic complete response. Matrix-producing morphology was associated with higher probability of achieving pathologic complete response (p = 0.027). Similar to other breast cancer subtypes, tumor size and lymph node status are prognostic in metaplastic carcinomas. The pathologic complete response rate of metaplastic breast carcinoma in our cohort was 17%, higher than previously reported. Although the matrix-producing subtype was associated with pathologic complete response, there was no survival difference with respect to tumor subtypes."
30723263,chemotherapy,"Emergence of Dengue as one of the deadliest viral diseases prompts the need for development of effective therapeutic agents. Dengue virus (DV) exists in four different serotypes and infection caused by one serotype predisposes its host to another DV serotype heterotypic re-infection. We undertook virtual ligand screening (VLS) to filter compounds against DV that may inhibit inclusively all of its serotypes. Conserved non-structural DV protein targets such as NS1, NS3/NS2B and NS5, which play crucial role in viral replication, infection cycle and host interaction, were selected for screening of vital antiviral drug leads. A dataset of plant based natural antiviral derivatives was developed. Molecular docking was performed to estimate the spatial affinity of target compounds for the active sites of DV's NS1, NS3/NS2B and NS5 proteins. The drug likeliness of the screened compounds was followed by ADMET analysis whereas the binding behaviors were further elucidated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation experiments. VLS screened three potential compounds including Canthin-6-one 9-O-beta-glucopyranoside, Kushenol W and Kushenol K which exhibited optimal binding with all the three conserved DV proteins. This study brings forth novel scaffolds against DV serotypes to serve as lead molecules for further optimization and drug development against all DV serotypes with equal effect against multiple disease causing DV proteins. We therefore anticipate that the insights given in the current study could be regarded valuable towards exploration and development of a broad-spectrum natural anti-dengue therapy."
