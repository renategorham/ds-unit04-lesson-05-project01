30712317,"Darier disease is a rare autosomal-dominant genodermatosis with a loss of function of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase pump (SERCA2-pump). Clinically, the disease is characterized by red-brown keratotic papules mainly in seborrheic areas and has only limited and unsatisfactory treatment options. Previously, low-dose naltrexone was described as a successful treatment option in Hailey-Hailey-disease, a genodermatosis with a genetic mutation coding for a similar loss of function of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> -ATPase pump (hSPCA1-pump)."
30712214,"Histologic variants are uncommon but well reported amongst cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma, including those in the setting of hormonal and/or chemoradiation therapy and castration resistance. However, the spectrum of morphologic phenotypes and molecular alterations present in such histologic variants are still incompletely understood. Herein, we describe a case of metastatic prostatic adenocarcinoma with hormonal and chemoradiation therapy-associated differentiation, displaying a combination of squamous cell, small cell, and sarcomatoid elements. The morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular observations are discussed with attention given to the gene alterations present, including in TP53, NF1, AR, PTEN, and RB1. Finally, we will compare our findings with those observed in uncommonly reported similar cases so as to detail the molecular underpinnings of such processes which may carry therapeutic implications."
30712057,Approximately 10-20% of children with idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (NS) fail to respond to steroid therapy. NS is divided into steroid-sensitive NS (SSNS) and steroid-resistant NS (SRNS). Over 45 recessive and dominant genes have been found to be associated with SRNS and/or focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).
30711576,"In 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved voretigene neparvovec-rzyl (Luxturna), a gene therapy used to treat a rare form of inherited blindness. Widely described as a curative treatment that 'restores vision', it was priced at US$850 000. Although voretigene neparvovec-rzyl represents a substantial therapeutic advance, most reports have failed to adequately describe study outcomes as documented by FDA reviewers. These documents reveal that the drug is not expected to restore normal vision, that only about half of treated patients met the FDA's threshold for minimally meaningful improvement, that improvements might not persist, that the original endpoint was abandoned after yielding mixed results, and that two patients experienced permanent vision loss. Over US$100 million of additional publicly -funded costs are not reflected in the US$850 000 figure."
30711574,"Therapeutic recombinant glycoproteins are important for both the biotechnological industry and clinical purposes. Given the rapid clearance of these proteins from the circulation, they have to be injected frequently to obtain optimal therapy. Several strategies have been developed to overcome this limitation, aiming to increase the half-life of such proteins in the circulation. These strategies included chemical attachment of polyethylene glycol, nanocapsulation, fusion to immunoglobulins or to albumin as protein carriers, or enrichment of the carbohydrate content. Here, we describe a strategy for increasing the half-life of recombinant proteins using gene fusion to increase the carbohydrate content of the protein backbone."

30711484,"While the link between GBA and Parkinson's disease (PD) was initially unexpected, it is now well established that GBA mutations are the most frequent genetic risk for PD. GBA has also been linked to sporadic PD, dementia with Lewy bodies, and ageing. Thus, GBA represents a promising target to counteract brain disease and the age-related decline of lysosomal function. The exact mechanisms involved in the risk of developing PD in GBA mutation carriers are still unclear and research in this field has faced the major challenge of a lack of proper modeling systems. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) as well as advances in disease modeling and genome editing have facilitated studies of human brain disease. With regard to GBA-PD, iPSCs offer several advantages including the possibility of investigating sphingolipid (SPL) biology in relevant cells, the role of dopamine metabolism as well as non-cell autonomous mechanisms that are likely involved in the disease process. This review will summarize findings emerged from iPSC-based studies in the context of GBA-PD pathology and therapy. We also highlight current advantages and challenges of stem cell models for neurological disease modeling and drug discovery."
30711447,"Dilated cardiomyopathy is a common cause of death in patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). Gene therapies for DMD must, therefore, have a therapeutic impact in cardiac as well as skeletal muscles. Our previous studies have shown that GALGT2 overexpression in mdx skeletal muscles can prevent muscle damage. Here we have tested whether rAAVrh74.MCK.GALGT2 gene therapy in mdx cardiac muscle can prevent the loss of heart function. Treatment of mdx hearts with rAAVrh74.MCK.GALGT2 1 day after birth did not negatively alter hemodynamic function, tested at 3 months of age, and it prevented early left ventricular remodeling and expression of fibrotic gene markers. Intravenous treatment of mdx mice with rAAVrh74.MCK.GALGT2 at 2 months of age significantly improved stroke volume and cardiac output compared to mock-treated mice analyzed at 17 months, both at rest and after stimulation with dobutamine. rAAVrh74.MCK.GALGT2 treatment of mdx heart correlated with increased glycosylation of α-dystroglycan with the CT glycan and increased utrophin protein expression. These data provide the first demonstration that GALGT2 overexpression can inhibit the loss of cardiac function in the dystrophin-deficient heart and, thus, may benefit both cardiac and skeletal muscles in DMD patients."
30711308,"An alternative to human red blood cells (RBCs) for clinical transfusion would be advantageous, particularly in situations of massive acute blood loss (where availability and compatibility are limited) or chronic hematologic diseases requiring frequent transfusions (resulting in alloimmunization). Ideally, any alternative must be neither immunogenic nor pathogenic, but readily available, inexpensive, and physiologically effective. Pig RBCs (pRBCs) provide a promising alternative due to their several similarities with human RBCs, and our increasing ability to genetically-modify pigs to reduce cellular immunogenicity. We briefly summarize the history of xenotransfusion, the progress that has been made in recent years, and the remaining barriers. These barriers include prevention of (i) human natural antibody binding to pRBCs, (ii) their phagocytosis by macrophages, and (iii) the T cell adaptive immune response (in the absence of exogenous immunosuppressive therapy). Although techniques of genetic engineering have advanced in recent years, novel methods to introduce human transgenes into pRBCs (which do not have nuclei) will need to be developed before clinical trials can be initiated."
30711060,The gene therapy voretigene neparvovec (VN) is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for vision loss owing to the ultra-rare RPE65-mediated inherited retinal disorders. We modeled the cost-utility of VN compared with standard of care (SoC).
30711039,"Due to the emergence of virulent and antibiotic-resistant microbes, natural antimicrobials from herbal origins have been given more attention as an alternative therapy. This study provides an in vitro research framework to investigate the antibacterial activities of 5 herbal (marjoram, garlic, onion, cinnamon and black seed) oil extracts against 16 multidrug-resistant (MDR) and virulent P. multocida serogroup A isolates recovered from dead and clinically diseased rabbits. Pathogenicity of the screened isolates was further proven experimentally and was verified by PCR analyses of 5 randomly selected virulence genes encoding attachment and colonization proteins (ptfA, pfhA, and omp87), sialidases (nanB) and dermonecrotoxin (toxA). A total of 12 P. multocida isolates were highly pathogenic with the possession of all examined virulence genes, while the other 4 isolates were of lower pathogenicity with expression of the target genes except toxA. In vitro anti-P. multocida activities of the 5 extracts and their synergism rates with 4 antibiotic drugs revealed that marjoram and cinnamon extracts had the highest antibacterial activities and the highest synergism rates against the screened isolates. Pasteurella multocida virulence gene expression profiles were assessed via real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in response to marjoram extract. The quantitative analyses showed less than five-fold reduction in the targeted virulence genes expression in presence of marjoram extract compared with the control. The findings from this study document a novel molecular inhibitory activity of marjoram against P. multocida multiple virulence genes and provide a proof of concept for its implementation as an alternative candidate for the treatment of pasteurellosis in farm animals in future."
30711028,"Arrestins play a key role in homologous desensitization of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) and regulate several other vital signaling pathways in cells. Considering the critical roles of these proteins in cellular signaling, surprisingly few disease-causing mutations in human arrestins were described. Most of these are loss-of-function mutations of visual arrestin-1 that cause excessive rhodopsin signaling and hence night blindness. Only one dominant arrestin-1 mutation was discovered so far. It reduces the thermal stability of the protein, which likely results in photoreceptor death via unfolded protein response. In case of the two nonvisual arrestins, only polymorphisms were described, some of which appear to be associated with neurological disorders and altered response to certain treatments. Structure-function studies revealed several ways of enhancing arrestins' ability to quench GPCR signaling. These enhanced arrestins have potential as tools for gene therapy of disorders associated with excessive signaling of mutant GPCRs."
30711024,"Chemokines are a class of chemotactic small molecule peptides whose receptors CCR5 and CXCR4 play important role in the entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) into immune cells. Chemokines belong to G protein-coupled receptor superfamily containing seven hydrophobic transmembrane helices, causing physiological effects such as chemotaxis, immune regulation, antiviral immunity, regulation of hematopoiesis and angiogenesis, as well as cell growth and metabolism, through certain signaling pathways. Earlier studies have shown that HIV infects the human immune cells by binding to the CD4 receptor. Soon, it was discovered that HIV-1 enters into human immune cells by binding to another receptor, chemokine receptor, which acts as co-receptor for CD4 during the invasion of HIV-1 into cells. Since complex receptor binding is important for HIV-1 invasion, antagonizing the binding has become an attractive and rational drug design goal. Early studies sought to block the interaction between virus and the receptors by chemically modifying the CCR5 and CXCR4 ligands. Although drug treatment is widely used, drug treatment cannot cure AIDS; it can only inhibit the replication of the virus, and HIV/AIDS patients need to take drugs for life. In addition, anti-AIDS drugs also produce side effects such as diseases of the cardiovascular system, nervous system, and metabolic system. In 2006, the emergence of ""Berlin patient"" led researchers to focus on gene therapy in chemokine receptors. In 2006 and 2007, the attending physician of ""Berlin patient"" cured his AIDS by transplantation of the stem cells from a donor who was homozygous for the CCR5 Δ32 mutation. This review summarizes the research progress in the mutation in chemokine receptor of HIV/AIDS."
30710998,Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen causing various nosocomial infections. The spread of multidrug-resistant A. baumannii is a major public health problem.

30710735,"Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin (ASA) and clopidogrel (CLP) has been consistently shown clinical effectiveness in patients with coronary artery disease. According to the literature, four traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) herbs effective for prevention cardiovascular diseases, namely Radix Salvia Miltiorrhiza (Red sage root, Danshen), Radix Pueraria Lobata (Kudzu root, Gegen), Radix Angelica Sinensis (Angelica root, Danggui), and Rhizoma Ligusticum chuanxiong (Szehuan lovage rhizome, Chuanxiong), are of high potential to be co-administered during DAPT. Since all these herbs are blood vitalizing medicines and can promote blood circulation and eliminate blood stasis, it was hypothesized that they may potentially alter the clinical outcomes of DAPT with clopidogrel and aspirin."
30710592,"Zinc transporter 8 (ZnT8) is a novel immunodominant autoantigen, associated with Type-1 diabetes. A non-synonymous polymorphism (R325W) in its gene is associated with Type-2 diabetes. In this study, we performed an in silico B cell epitope prediction followed by wetlab validation of ZnT8. Apart from the previously characterized polymorphic epitope (BE-5 TAASR*DS), two novel epitopes BE-2 (N-terminus) and BE-6 (C-terminus) were identified. Wet lab validation of these epitopes was carried out by measuring ZnT8 specific isotypes (IgG, IgM and IgA) in the sera of Normal Glucose Tolerant (NGT), Type-1 diabetic (T1DM) and Type-2 diabetic (T2DM) patients by indirect ELISA. Unexpectedly, compared to NGT, significantly decreased levels of IgG and IgA isotypes was seen in T1DM subjects without complications. IgM levels were reduced in T1DM subjects with retinopathy. Newly diagnosed T1DM subjects initiated on insulin therapy showed an increase in IgA and decrease in IgM titre. Like T1DM, significantly reduced level of IgG, IgM and IgA was seen in T2DM subjects. For the first time, we have identified novel cryptic B cell epitopes in ZnT8 autoantigen against which the naturally occurring autoantibody levels were found to be reduced in diabetes."
30710569,"Spinal cord injury results in sensation dysfunction. This study explored miR-142-3p, which acts a critical role in sciatic nerve conditioning injury (SNCI) promoting the repair of the dorsal column injury and validated its function on primary sensory neuron(DRG). miR-142-3p expression increased greatly in the spinal cord dorsal column lesion (SDCL) group and increased slightly in the SNCI group. Subsequently, the expression of adenylate cyclase 9 (AC9), the target gene of miR-142-3p, declined sharply in the SDCL group and declined limitedly in the SNCI group. The expression trend of cAMP was opposite to that of miR-142-3p. MiR-142-3p inhibitor improved the axon length, upregulated the expression of AC9, cAMP, p-CREB, IL-6, and GAP43, and downregulated the expression of GTP-RhoA. miR-142-3p inhibitor combined with AC9 siRNA showed shorter axon length, the expression of AC9, cAMP, p-CREB, IL-6, and GAP43 was decreased, and the expression of GTP-RhoA was increased. H89 and AG490, inhibitors of cAMP/PKA pathway and IL6/STAT3/GAP43 axis, respectively, declined the enhanced axonal growth by miR-142-3p inhibitor and altered the expression level of the corresponding proteins. Thus, a substitution therapy using Sorafenib that downregulates the miR-142-3p expression for SNCI was investigated. The results showed the effect of Sorafenib was similar to that of miR-142-3p inhibitor and SNCI on both axon growth in vitro and sensory conduction function recovery in vivo. In conclusion, miR-142-3p acts a pivotal role in SNCI promoting the repair of dorsal column injury. Sorafenib mimics the treatment effect of SNCI via downregulation of miR-142-3p, subsequently, promoting sensory conduction function recovery post dorsal column injury."
30710527,Crohn's disease (CD) is characterized by an imbalance of effector and regulatory T cells in the intestinal mucosa. The efficacy of anti-adhesion therapies led us to investigate whether impaired trafficking of T-regulatory (Treg) cells contributes to the pathogenesis of CD. We also investigated whether proper function could be restored to Treg cells by ex vivo expansion in the presence of factors that activate their regulatory activities.
30710273,"A multitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensor proteins containing the specific Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding motif (helix-loop-helix, called EF-hand) are of major clinical relevance in a many human diseases. Measurements of troponin, the first intracellular Ca-sensor protein to be discovered, is nowadays the ""gold standard"" in the diagnosis of patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Mutations have been identified in calmodulin and linked to inherited ventricular tachycardia and in patients affected by severe cardiac arrhythmias. Parvalbumin, when introduced into the diseased heart by gene therapy to increase contraction and relaxation speed, is considered to be a novel therapeutic strategy to combat heart failure. S100 proteins, the largest subgroup with the EF-hand protein family, are closely associated with cardiovascular diseases, various types of cancer, inflammation, and autoimmune pathologies. The intention of this review is to summarize the clinical importance of this protein family and their use as biomarkers and potential drug targets, which could help to improve the diagnosis of human diseases and identification of more selective therapeutic interventions."
30710146,"Discovery of new actionable targets and functional networks in melanoma is an urgent need as only a fraction of metastatic patients achieves durable clinical benefit by targeted therapy or immunotherapy approaches. Here we show that NFATc2 expression is associated with an EMT-like transcriptional program and with an invasive melanoma phenotype, as shown by analysis of melanoma cell lines at the mRNA and protein levels, interrogation of the TCGA melanoma dataset and characterization of melanoma lesions by immunohistochemistry. Gene silencing or pharmacological inhibition of NFATc2 downregulated EMT-related genes and AXL, and suppressed c-Myc, FOXM1, and EZH2. Targeting of c-Myc suppressed FOXM1 and EZH2, while targeting of FOXM1 suppressed EZH2. Inhibition of c-Myc, or FOXM1, or EZH2 downregulated EMT-related gene expression, upregulated MITF and suppressed migratory and invasive activity of neoplastic cells. Stable silencing of NFATc2 impaired melanoma cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo in SCID mice. In NFATc2<sup>+</sup> EZH2<sup>+</sup> melanoma cell lines pharmacological co-targeting of NFATc2 and EZH2 exerted strong anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic activity, irrespective of BRAF or NRAS mutations and of BRAF inhibitor resistance. These results provide preclinical evidence for a role of NFATc2 in shaping the EMT-like melanoma phenotype and reveal a targetable vulnerability associated with NFATc2 and EZH2 expression in melanoma cells belonging to different mutational subsets."
30710128,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors are the leading platform for gene delivery for the treatment of a variety of human diseases. Recent advances in developing clinically desirable AAV capsids, optimizing genome designs and harnessing revolutionary biotechnologies have contributed substantially to the growth of the gene therapy field. Preclinical and clinical successes in AAV-mediated gene replacement, gene silencing and gene editing have helped AAV gain popularity as the ideal therapeutic vector, with two AAV-based therapeutics gaining regulatory approval in Europe or the United States. Continued study of AAV biology and increased understanding of the associated therapeutic challenges and limitations will build the foundation for future clinical success."
30710047,"Immunonutrition as a therapeutic approach is rapidly gaining interest in the fight against infection. Targeting l-arginine metabolism is intriguing, considering this amino acid is the substrate for antimicrobial NO production by macrophages. The importance of l-arginine during infection is supported by the finding that inhibiting its synthesis from its precursor l-citrulline blunts host defense. During the first few weeks following pulmonary mycobacterial infection, we found a drastic increase in l-citrulline in the lung, even though serum concentrations were unaltered. This correlated with increased gene expression of the l-citrulline-generating (i.e., iNOS) and l-citrulline-using (i.e., Ass1) enzymes in key myeloid populations. Eliminating l-arginine synthesis from l-citrulline in myeloid cells via conditional deletion of either <i>Ass1</i> or <i>Asl</i> resulted in increased <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> bacillus Calmette-Guérin and <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> H<sub>37</sub>R<sub>v</sub> burden in the lungs compared with controls. Our data illustrate the necessity of l-citrulline metabolism for myeloid defense against mycobacterial infection and highlight the potential for host-directed therapy against mycobacterial disease targeting this nutrient and/or its metabolic pathway."
30709904,"The hormone relaxin is considered a potential therapy for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). We have previously shown that a potential limitation to relaxin-based IPF therapy is decreased expression of a relaxin receptor, relaxin/insulin-like family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1), in IPF fibroblasts. The mechanism that down-regulates RXFP1 in IPF remains unclear. To determine whether microRNAs (miRs) regulate RXFP1 gene expression, here we employed a bioinformatics approach to identify miRs predicted to target RXFP1 and identified a putative miR-144-3p target site in the RXFP1 mRNA. In situ hybridization of IPF lung biopsies revealed that miR-144-3p is expressed in fibroblastic foci. Further, we found that miR-144-3p is up-regulated in IPF fibroblasts compared with lung fibroblasts from healthy donors. Transforming growth factor β increased miR-144-3p expression in both healthy and IPF lung fibroblasts in a SMAD family 2/3 (SMAD2/3)-dependent manner, and Jun proto-oncogene AP-1 transcription factor subunit (AP-1) was required for constitutive miR-144-3p expression. Overexpression of an miR-144-3p mimic significantly reduced RXFP1 mRNA and protein levels and increased expression of the myofibroblast marker α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) in healthy lung fibroblasts. IPF lung fibroblasts transfected with anti-miR-144-3p had increased RXFP1 expression and reduced α-SMA expression. Of note, a lentiviral luciferase reporter carrying the WT 3'UTR of RXFP1 was significantly repressed in IPF lung fibroblasts, whereas a reporter carrying a mutated miR-144-3p-binding site exhibited less sensitivity toward endogenous miR-144-3p expression, indicating that miR-144-3p down-regulates RXFP1 in IPF lung fibroblasts by targeting its 3'UTR. We conclude that miR-144-3p directly represses RXFP1 mRNA and protein expression."
30709875,"Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant condition associated with a high risk of a broad range of childhood- and adult-onset cancers. LFS is related to germline mutations of the tumor-suppressor gene <i>TP53</i> The most common reported leukemia associated with LFS is hypodiploid acute lymphoblastic leukemia, but myeloid malignancies including acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) are also reported, often in the setting of therapy-related disease. We reviewed the clinicopathologic characteristics including cytogenetics and molecular analysis for seven adult patients with LFS and hematologic malignancies evaluated at the Hereditary Hematologic Malignancy Clinic (HHMC) at MD Anderson Cancer Center. We present this LFS review series to increase awareness of LFS for the appropriate diagnosis of both patients and potentially affected relatives, as well as provide experience with patient outcomes in this difficult to treat population."
30709791,"Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft tissue sarcoma accounting for 5-8% of malignant tumours in children and adolescents. Children with high risk disease have poor prognosis. Anti-RMS therapies include surgery, radiation and combination chemotherapy. While these strategies improved survival rates, they have plateaued since 1990s as drugs that target differentiation and self-renewal of tumours cells have not been identified. Moreover, prevailing treatments are aggressive with drug resistance and metastasis causing failure of several treatment regimes. Significant advances have been made recently in understanding the genetic and epigenetic landscape in RMS. These studies have identified novel diagnostic and prognostic markers and opened new avenues for treatment. An important target identified in high throughput drug screening studies is reactive oxygen species (ROS). Indeed, many drugs in clinical trials for RMS impact tumour progression through ROS. In light of such emerging evidence, we discuss recent findings highlighting key pathways, epigenetic alterations and their impacts on ROS that form the basis of developing novel molecularly targeted therapies in RMS. Such targeted therapies in combination with conventional therapy could reduce adverse side effects in young survivors and lead to a decline in long-term morbidity."
30709530,"Evaluation of the upper airway is key for a successful surgical management. Proper evaluation can be done only with a good understanding of the anatomy and pathophysiology of the upper airway. The authors discuss surgical anatomy from a soft tissue and bony perspective in detail along with its clinical implications. The complex interaction among pharyngeal dilator tone, arousal threshold, respiratory control instability, and changes in lung volume during sleep play an important role in obstructive sleep apnea. Because all the anatomic and physiologic characteristics discussed have genetic predisposition, gene therapy may play a pivotal role in the future."
30709364,"Giant axonal neuropathy (GAN; ORPHA: 643; OMIM# 256850) is a rare, hereditary, pediatric neurodegenerative disorder associated with intracellular accumulations of intermediate filaments (IFs). GAN knockout (KO) mouse models mirror the IF dysregulation and widespread nervous system pathology seen in human GAN. Validation of therapeutic efficacy and viral vector delivery systems with these GAN KO models has provided the springboard for the development of a viral vector being delivered intrathecally in an ongoing Phase I gene therapy clinical trial for the treatment of children with GAN ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02362438 ). During the course of a comprehensive pathologic characterization of the GAN KO mouse, we discovered the very early and unexpected involvement of the ocular lens. Light microscopy revealed the presence of intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within lens epithelial cells. The inclusion bodies showed strong immunohistochemical positivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). We confirmed that intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are also present within lens epithelial cells in human GAN. These IF inclusion bodies in lens epithelial cells are unique to GAN. Similar IF inclusion bodies in lens epithelial cells have not been reported previously in experimental animal models or human diseases. Since current paradigms in drug discovery and drug repurposing for IF-associated disorders are often hindered by lack of validated targets, our findings suggest that lens epithelial cells in the GAN KO mouse may provide a potential target, in vivo and in vitro, for evaluating drug efficacy and alternative therapeutic approaches in promoting the clearance of IF inclusions in GAN and other diseases characterized by intracellular IF accumulations."
30709346,"Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) is an oncogene constitutively activated in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and HCC cancer stem cells (CSCs). Constitutively activated STAT3 plays a pivotal role in holding cancer stemness of HCC CSCs, which are essential for hepatoma initiation, relapse, metastasis and drug resistance. Therefore, STAT3 has been validated as a novel anti-cancer drug target and the strategies targeting HCC CSCs may bring new hopes to HCC therapy. This study aimed to isolate and identify small-molecule STAT3 signaling inhibitors targeting CSCs from the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) extract of the roots of Polygonum cuspidatum and to evaluate their in vitro anti-cancer activities."
30709123,"In this paper, we study targeted immunization in a multilayer Boolean network model for genetic regulatory networks. Given a specific set of nodes immune to perturbations, we find that the stability of a multilayer Boolean network is determined by the largest eigenvalue of the weighted non-backtracking matrix of corresponding aggregated network. Aimed to minimize this largest eigenvalue, we developed the metric of multilayer collective influence (MCI) to quantify the impact of immunizing individual nodes on the stability of the system. Compared with other competing heuristics, immunizing nodes with high MCI scores can stabilize an unstable multilayer network with higher efficiency on both synthetic and real-world networks. Moreover, despite that coupling nodes can exert direct influence across multiple layers, they are found to exhibit less importance as measured by the MCI score. Our work reveals the mechanism of maintaining the stability of multilayer Boolean networks and provides an efficient targeted immunization strategy, which can be potentially applied to the location of pathogenesis of diseases and the development of targeted therapy."
30709066,"High frequency (HF) electromagnetic fields (EMFs) have been widely used in many wireless communication devices, yet within the terahertz (THz) range, their effects on biological systems are poorly understood. In this study, electromagnetic radiation in the range of 0.3⁻19.5 × 10<sup>12</sup> Hz, generated using a synchrotron light source, was used to investigate the response of PC 12 neuron-like pheochromocytoma cells to THz irradiation. The PC 12 cells remained viable and physiologically healthy, as confirmed by a panel of biological assays; however, exposure to THz radiation for 10 min at 25.2 ± 0.4 °C was sufficient to induce a temporary increase in their cell membrane permeability. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed cell membrane permeabilization via visualisation of the translocation of silica nanospheres (<i>d</i> = 23.5 ± 0.2 nm) and their clusters (<i>d</i> = 63 nm) into the PC 12 cells. Analysis of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) micrographs revealed the formation of atypically large (up to 1 µm) blebs on the surface of PC 12 cells when exposed to THz radiation. Long-term analysis showed no substantial differences in metabolic activity between the PC 12 cells exposed to THz radiation and untreated cells; however, a higher population of the THz-treated PC 12 cells responded to the nerve growth factor (NGF) by extending longer neurites (up to 0⁻20 µm) compared to the untreated PC12 cells (up to 20 µm). These findings present implications for the development of nanoparticle-mediated drug delivery and gene therapy strategies since THz irradiation can promote nanoparticle uptake by cells without causing apoptosis, necrosis or physiological damage, as well as provide a deeper fundamental insight into the biological effects of environmental exposure of cells to electromagnetic radiation of super high frequencies."
30708965,"Iron toxicity is associated with organ injury and has been reported in various clinical conditions, such as hemochromatosis, thalassemia major, and myelodysplastic syndromes. Therefore, iron chelation therapy represents a pivotal therapy for these patients during their lifetime. The aim of the present study was to assess the iron chelating properties of α-lipoic acid (ALA) and how such an effect impacts on iron overload mediated toxicity. Human mesenchymal stem cells (HS-5) and animals (zebrafish, <i>n</i> = 10 for each group) were treated for 24 h with ferric ammonium citrate (FAC, 120 µg/mL) in the presence or absence of ALA (20 µg/mL). Oxidative stress was evaluated by reduced glutathione content, reactive oxygen species formation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and gene expression of heme oxygenase-1b and mitochondrial superoxide dismutase; organ injury, iron accumulation, and autophagy were measured by microscopical, cytofluorimetric analyses, and inductively coupled plasma‒optical mission Spectrometer (ICP-OES). Our results showed that FAC results in a significant increase of tissue iron accumulation, oxidative stress, and autophagy and such detrimental effects were reversed by ALA treatment. In conclusion, ALA possesses excellent iron chelating properties that may be exploited in a clinical setting for organ preservation, as well as exhibiting a good safety profile and low cost for the national health system."
30708354,"Low energy X-ray Intra-Operative Radiation Therapy (IORT) is used mostly for breast cancer treatment with spherical applicators. X-ray IORT treatment delivered during surgery (ex: INTRABEAM®, Carl Zeiss) can benefit from accurate and fast dose prediction in a patient 3D volume. However, full Monte Carlo (MC) simulations are time-consuming and no commercial treatment planning system was available for this treatment delivery technique. Therefore, the aim of this work is to develop a dose computation tool based on MC phase space information, which computes fast and accurate dose distributions for spherical and needle INTRABEAM® applicators. First, a database of monoenergetic phase-space (PHSP) files and depth dose profiles (DDPs) in water for each applicator is generated at factory and stored for on-site use. During commissioning of a given INTRABEAM® unit, the proposed Fast and Optimized Phase-Space (FOPS) generation process creates a phase-space at the exit of the applicator considered, by fitting the energy spectrum of the source to a combination of the monoenergetic precomputed phase-spaces, by means of a genetic algorithm, with simple experimental data of depth dose profiles in water provided by the user. An in-house hybrid MC algorithm which takes into account condensed history simulations of photoelectric, Rayleigh and Compton interactions for X-rays up to 1 MeV computes the dose from the optimized phase-space file. The whole process has been validated against radiochromic films in water as well as reference MC simulations performed with penEasy in heterogeneous phantoms. From the pre-computed monoenergetic PHSP files and DDPs, building the PHSP file optimized to a particular depth-dose curve in water only takes a few minutes in a single core (i7@2.5 GHz), for all the applicators considered in this work, and this needs to be done only when the X-ray source is replaced. Once the phase-space file is ready, the hybrid Monte Carlo code is able to compute dose distributions within 10 minutes. For all the applicators, more than 95% of voxels from dose distributions computed with the FOPS+hybrid code agreed within 7%-0.5 mm with both reference MC simulations and measurements. The method proposed has been fully validated and it is now implemented into radiance (GMV SA, Spain), the first commercial IORT Treatment Planning System (TPS)."

Here, we report graphene-reinforced chitosan (CS) construct based non-viral vector for tumor-targeted gene therapy. The therapeutic gene, pDNA-TNF-α, was loaded on to chitosan-carboxylated graphene oxide (CS-CGO) construct via electrostatic interaction. The pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO thus obtained was further passivated with 4,7,10-trioxa-1,13-tridecanediamine for protecting the vector from the mononuclear phagocyte system that contributes to the prolongation of circulation half-life. The surface passivated carrier (PEG-pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO) then festooned with the folic acid derived carbon dots (C-dots) for targeting folate receptors that are overexpressed in most of the cancer cells. The results of TEM images and zeta potential values ensured the occurrence of desired changes in each stage of C-dot-PEG-pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO formulation. After 14 days of incubation, the anti-angiogenesis effect was observed for final formulation in the chorioallantoic membrane. The results of in vitro gene expression study in cancer cell line show a comparatively higher transfection efficacy of the developed system (C-dot-PEG-pDNA-TNF-α-CS-CGO) than pDNA-TNF-α. The efficiency of the developed gene delivery system was further confirmed using a developed and validated artificial tumor cell apparatus."
30707858,"Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease affecting more than 70,000 people worldwide. Caused by a mutation in the CFTR gene, cystic fibrosis can result in difficulty breathing, widespread bacterial infections, edema, malnutrition, pancreatitis, and death. Current drug-based treatments struggle to reach the site of action due to the thick mucus, and only manage symptoms such as blocked airways, lung infections, and limited ability to digest food. Nanotechnology opens up possibilities for improved treatment strategies by focusing on drug penetration through the mucus lining, eliminating resulting bacterial infections, and targeting the underlying genetic cause of the disease. In this review, we present recent nanoparticle developments for cystic fibrosis, challenges in nanomedicine therapeutics, and future research directions in gene editing and nonviral vectors for gene delivery."
30707220,"It has been suggested that arteriolar annuli localized in retinal arterioles regulate retinal blood flow acting as sphincters. Here, the morphology and protein expression profile of arteriolar annuli have been analyzed under physiologic conditions in the retina of wild-type, β-actin-Egfp, and Nestin-gfp transgenic mice. Additionally, to study the effect of hypertension, the KAP transgenic mouse has been used."
30706949,"Gene therapy with an adeno-associated vector (AAV) serotype 8 encoding the human ATP7B cDNA (AAV8-ATP7B) is able to provide long-term copper metabolism correction in 6-week-old male Wilson's disease (WD) mice. However, the size of the genome (5.2 kb) surpasses the optimal packaging capacity of the vector, which resulted in low-yield production; in addition, further analyses in WD female mice and in animals with a more advanced disease revealed reduced therapeutic efficacy, as compared to younger males. To improve the efficacy of the treatment, an optimized shorter AAV vector was generated, in which four out of six metal binding domains (MBD) were deleted from the ATP7B coding sequence, giving rise to the miniATP7B protein (Δ57-486-ATP7B). In contrast to AAV8-ATP7B, AAV8-miniATP7B could be produced at high titers and was able to restore copper homeostasis in 6- and 12-week-old male and female WD mice. In addition, a recently developed synthetic AAV vector, AAVAnc80, carrying the mini-ATP7B gene was similarly effective at preventing liver damage, restoring copper homeostasis and improving survival one year after treatment. Transduction of approximately 20% of the hepatocytes was sufficient to normalize copper homeostasis, suggesting that corrected hepatocytes are acting as a sink to eliminate excess of copper. Importantly, administration of AAVAnc80-miniATP7B was safe in healthy mice and did not result in copper deficiency. In summary, gene therapy using an optimized therapeutic cassette in different AAV systems provides long-term correction of copper metabolism regardless of gender or stage of disease in a clinically relevant WD mouse model. These results pave the way for the implementation of gene therapy in WD patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."

30706779,"Redox homeostasis is important for the maintenance of cell survival. Under physiological conditions, redox system works in a balance and involves activation of many signaling molecules. Regulation of redox balance via signaling molecules is achieved by different pathways and proteasomal system is a key pathway in this process. Importance of proteasomal system on signaling pathways has been investigated for many years. In this direction, many proteasome targeting molecules have been developed. Some of them are already in the clinic for cancer treatment and some are still under investigation to highlight underlying mechanisms. Although there are many studies done, molecular mechanisms of proteasome inhibitors and related signaling pathways need more detailed explanations. This review aims to discuss redox status and proteasomal system related signaling pathways. In addition, cancer therapies targeting proteasomal system and their effects on redox related pathways have been summarized."
30706699,"Mutations in the mitochondrial alanyl-transfer (t)RNA synthetase 2 (AARS2,OMIM:612035) have been linked to leukoencephalopathy recently. Till now, there have been 19 cases reported so far. However, the clinical and genetic characteristics of this disease are not fully understood. We reported an adult-onset male leukoencephalopathy patient related to novel AARS2 gene mutations and reviewed all previous cases regarding the clinical and genetic features of AARS2 leukoencephalopathy."
30706587,"The causes for intrinsic tooth discoloration can be separated into two categories as systemic and local. Systemic causes are either genetic or drug induced effects. The development of dentition can also be affected by a number of systemic factors and metabolic diseases such as porphyria. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP), also known as Gunther's disease, is a metabolic disease caused by a transformation in the gene that codifies uroporphyrinogen-3 shynthesis, leading to porphyrin aggregation in urine, skin, bone, and dentin."
30706571,"While a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cognitive impairment have been identified, independent replications remain the only way to validate proposed signals. We investigated SNPs in candidate genes associated with either cognitive impairment or AD pathogenesis and their relationships with probable dementia (PD) in the Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS)."
30706472,"Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer which develops from the occurrence of genetic mutations in the melanocytes. Based on the features of melanoma tumors such as location, genetic profile and stage, there are several therapeutic strategies including surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. However, because of the appearance resistance mechanisms, the efficiency of these treatments strategies may be reduced. It has been demonstrated that therapeutic monoclonal antibodies can improve the efficiency of melanoma therapies. Recently, several mAbs, such as nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and ipilimumab, were approved for the immunotherapy of melanoma. The antibodies inhibit immune checkpoint receptors such as CTL4 and pd-1. Another therapeutic strategy for the treatment of melanoma is cancer vaccines, which improve clinical outcomes in patients. The combination therapy using antibodies and gene vaccine give us a new perspective in the treatment of melanoma patients. Herein, we present the recent progressions in the melanoma immunotherapy, especially dendritic cells mRNA vaccines by reviewing recent literature."
30706458,"Improvement of survival in lymphocytic leukaemia has been accompanied by the occurrence of second primary cancer (SPCs). Based on Swedish Family Cancer Database, we applied bi-directional analyses in which relative risks (RRs) were calculated for any SPCs in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) and the risks of these leukaemias as SPCs. After CLL, RRs were significant for 20 SPCs, and high for skin squamous cell cancer (24·58 for in situ and 7·63 for invasive), Merkel cell carcinoma (14·36), Hodgkin lymphoma (7·16) and Kaposi sarcoma (6·76). Conversely, 15 CLL cancer pairs were reciprocally increased. The increased risks were reciprocal for ALL and four cancers. RR for ALL was 15·35 after myeloid neoplasia. HCL showed reciprocally increased RRs with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and melanoma. The concordance between RRs for bi-directional associations between CLL and different cancers, and HCL and different cancers was highly significant. For CLL (also for HCL), the bi-directional risks with skin cancers and other immune-related cancers suggest the probable involvement of immune dysfunction. For ALL, treatment may contribute to risks of multiple SPCs. Increased risk of ALL after haematological neoplasms may indicate bone marrow dysfunction. These findings may help guide treatment decisions and prognostic assessment."
30706407,"Gene therapy shows great promise for the treatment of neurological disorders, and accessing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the cerebellomedullary cistern through the posterior atlanto-occipital membrane has become a common route of delivery in preclinical studies. Unlike direct brain parenchymal infusions, CSF delivery offers broader coverage to the central and peripheral nervous system. This prospectively increases its translational value, more specially to treat global brain dysfunctions in which the pathology is disseminated throughout the brain and not focalized in one specific brain structure. Also, from the practical point of view, this approach offers a more reliable method for neurological gene replacement in infants, whose immature cranial suture preclude the use of skull-mounted devices. Here we describe a consistent, precise, and safe method for CSF injection."
30706406,Delivery of viral vectors directly into the central nervous system (CNS) has emerged as an important tool for the refinement of gene therapy. Intrathecal delivery by direct lumbar puncture in conscious rodents offers a minimally invasive approach that avoids tissue damage and/or destruction. Here we describe delivery of small quantities of viral vector product to the intrathecal space of rodents via direct lumbar puncture aided by a catheter.
30706405,"This protocol describes a method of delivering adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to the intrathecal space of nonhuman primates for CNS-directed gene therapy. It includes the surgical implantation of the catheter, vector infusion, necropsy, laser-capture microdissection of motor neurons, and gene expression analysis. This method allows efficient and reproducible delivery, and would be of interest to test gene therapy vectors for the treatment of disorders of the central nervous system of nonhuman primates. This protocol was tested in cynomolgus macaques and may be adapted for AAV delivery to different species of large animals."
30706404,"Many diseases affect multiple tissues and/or organ systems, or affect tissues that are broadly distributed. For these diseases, an effective gene therapy will require systemic delivery of the therapeutic vector to all affected locations. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been used as a gene therapy vector for decades in preclinical studies and human trials. These studies have shown outstanding safety and efficacy of the AAV vector for gene therapy. Recent studies have revealed yet another unique feature of the AAV vector. Specifically, AAV can lead to bodywide gene transfer following a single intravascular injection. Here we describe the protocols for effective systemic delivery of AAV in both neonatal and adult mice and dogs. We also share lessons we learned from systemic gene therapy in the murine and canine models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."
30706403,"Mesenchymal stromal cell (MSC) therapy has produced very promising results for multiple diseases in animal models, with over 780 clinical trials on going or completed. However, most of the human clinical trials have not been as successful as trials using preclinical models. To improve the therapeutic potential of MSCs, different research groups have used gene transfer vectors to express factors involved in migration, survival, differentiation, and immunomodulation. The ideal gene transfer vector for most applications should achieve long-term, stable (constitutive or inducible) transgene expression in MSCs and their progeny. Given their efficiency and low impact on transduced cells, lentiviral vectors (LVs) are the vectors of choice. In this chapter we will describe a detailed protocol for the generation of genetically modified MSCs using lentiviral vectors (LVs). Although this protocol has been optimized for MSC lentiviral transduction, it can be easily adapted to other stem cells by changing culture conditions while maintaining volumes and incubation times."
30706402,"In vivo gene therapy is a tremendous tool for a wide variety of genetic modifications. However, often a specific and precise local administration of the viral vector is necessary to deliver the genetic payload in vivo. For many animal studies using viral vectors, such as those investigating neurological disorders, the vector is targeted directly into the tissue/organ of interest. On the other hand, in vascular disease research, viral vectors are administered systemically, either via a tail vein injection or through catheter-mediated infusion, which results in off-target transduction of cells and tissues. Targeting cells in the vascular wall without off-target activity, however, requires localized delivery in order to efficiently target cells of the internal vasculature. Here we describe a novel murine in vivo targeted intra-arterial viral vector delivery method, which has been developed in order to be able to perform more intricate studies in cardiovascular disease."
30706401,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has become an important gene delivery vector for the treatment of inherited retinal degenerative diseases. Many of the mutations leading to retinal degeneration are inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern and can produce toxic gain-of-function and/or dominant-negative effects. Here we describe an allele-independent gene therapy strategy with rAAV to treat autosomal-dominant retinal degenerative diseases. In this methodology, we co-deliver a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) to inhibit expression of both the toxic and (WT) copies of the gene as well as an shRNA-resistant cDNA for functional gene replacement with a rAAV."
30706400,"Genetic nephropathies represent a challenging class of disorders to be treated by gene therapy. This is primarily due to the filtering properties of the kidney itself, which does not allow the vehicle carrying the transgene of interest to remain long enough in the organ to penetrate efficiently into the nephrotic cells. Also, the kidney has a complex anatomical structure composed of different cell types compartmentalized within isolated anatomic structures that limit their access. Here, we describe a simple surgical procedure to deliver recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) to the whole kidney based on the hydraulic force of the retrograde renal vein injection. In its clinical form, this procedure would correspond to a renal venography where a catheter is threaded retrograde from the femoral vein under fluoroscopic guidance."
30706399,Inner ear gene therapy offers great potential as a treatment for hearing loss and dizziness. The surgical method used to deliver gene therapy into the inner ear is a critical step in determining the success of inner ear gene therapy. Here we describe two commonly used surgical methods for gene delivery in neonatal mouse inner ear: the round window approach and the posterior semicircular canal approach. Both of these approaches are effective at delivering gene therapy to the neonatal mouse inner ear.
30706398,"The liver is an attractive target for gene therapy due to the high incidence of liver disease phenotypes. Adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV) are currently the most popular gene delivery system for targeting the liver, reflecting high transduction efficiency in vivo and the availability of a toolkit of multiple different capsids with high liver tropism. While AAV vectors confer stable gene transfer in the relatively quiescent adult liver, the predominantly episomal nature of AAV vector genomes results in less stable expression in the growing liver as a consequence of episome clearance during hepatocellular replication. This is an important consideration in experimental design involving young animals, particularly mice, where liver growth is rapid. Given the immense value of murine models for dissecting disease pathophysiology, experimental therapeutics and vector development, this technical manuscript focuses on AAV-mediated transduction of the mouse liver. Xenograft models, in which chimeric mouse-human livers can be established, are also amenable to AAV-mediated gene transfer and have proven to be powerful tools for in vivo selection and characterization of novel human-specific capsids. While yet to be confirmed, such models have the potential to more accurately predict transduction efficiency of clinical candidate vectors than nonhuman primate models."
30706397,"Treatments with poxvirus vectors can have long-lasting immunological impact in the host, and thus they have been extensively studied to treat diseases and for vaccine development. More importantly, the oncolytic properties of poxviruses have led to their development as cancer therapeutics. Two poxviruses, vaccinia virus (VACV) and myxoma virus (MYXV), have been extensively studied as virotherapeutics with promising results. Vaccinia virus vectors have advanced to the clinic and have been tested as oncolytic therapeutics for several cancer types with successes in phase I/II clinical trials. In addition to oncolytic applications, MYXV has been explored for additional applications including immunotherapeutics, purging of cancer progenitor cells, and treatments for graft-versus-host diseases. These novel therapeutic applications have encouraged its advancement into clinical trials. To meet the demands of different treatment needs, VACV and MYXV can be genetically engineered to express therapeutic transgenes. The engineering process used in poxvirus vectors can be very different from that of other DNA virus vectors (e.g., the herpesviruses). This chapter is intended to serve as a guide to those wishing to engineer poxvirus vectors for therapeutic transgene expression and to produce viral preparations for preclinical studies."
30706395,"Various adenovirus (AdV) vector systems have proven to be lucrative options for gene delivery. They can serve as potential vaccine candidates for prevention of several common infectious diseases and hold the promise for gene therapy, especially for cancer. Several AdV vector-based therapies are currently at various stages of clinical trials worldwide, which make an immense interest of both the clinicians and researchers. Since these vectors are easy to manipulate, have broad tropism, and have the capability to yield high titers, this delivery system has a wide range of applications for different clinical settings. This chapter emphasizes on some of the current usages of AdV vectors and their production methods."
30706391,"Gene transfer and gene therapy are powerful approaches for many biological research applications and promising avenues for the treatment of many genetic or cancer diseases. The most efficient gene transfer tools are currently derived from viruses. Among them, the recombinant adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are vectors of choice for many fundamental and therapeutic applications. The increasing number of clinical trials involving AAVs demonstrates the need to implement production and purification processes to meet the quantitative and qualitative demands of regulatory agencies for the use of these vectors in clinical trials. In this context, the rise of production levels on an industrial scale appeared essential. The introduction, in 2002, of an AAV process using a baculovirus expression vector system (BEVS) has circumvented this technological lock. The advantage of BEVS in expanding the AAV production in insect cells has been to switch the process to bioreactor systems, which are the ideal equipment for scaling up. We describe here a method for producing AAV vectors using the BEVS which can be easily used by research laboratories wishing to overcome the difficulties associated with the scaling up of production levels. The method provides sufficient quantities of AAV vectors to initiate preclinical projects in large animal models or for research projects where a single batch of vectors will consolidate the repeatability and reproducibility of in vitro and especially in vivo experimental approaches."
30706390,"Chemogenetics is the process of genetically expressing a macromolecule receptor capable of modulating the activity of the cell in response to selective chemical ligand. This chapter will cover the chemogenetic technologies that are available to date, focusing on the commonly available engineered or otherwise modified ligand-gated ion channels and G-protein-coupled receptors in the context of neuromodulation. First, we will give a brief overview of each chemogenetic approach as well as in vitro/in vivo applications, then we will list their strengths and weaknesses. Finally, we will provide tips for ligand application in each case.Each technology has specific limitations that make them more or less suitable for different applications in neuroscience although we will focus mainly on the most commonly used and versatile family named designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs or DREADDs. We here describe the most common cases where these can be implemented and provide tips on how and where these technologies can be applied in the field of neuroscience."
30706388,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR/Cas) system has emerged as an extremely useful tool for biological research and as a potential technology for gene therapy approaches. CRISPR/Cas mediated genome editing can be used to easily and efficiently modify endogenous genes in a large variety of cells and organisms. Furthermore, a modified version of the Cas9 nuclease has been developed that can be used for regulation of endogenous gene expression and labeling of genomic loci, among other applications. This chapter provides an introduction to the basis of the technology and a detail protocol for the most classic application: gene inactivation by CRISPR/Cas9 nuclease system from Streptococcus pyogenes. This workflow can be easily adapted for other CRISPR systems and applications."
30706387,"Today any researcher with the desire can easily purchase a viral vector. However, despite the availability of viral vectors themselves, the requisite knowledge that is absolutely essential to conducting a gene therapy experiment remains somewhat obscure and esoteric. To utilize viral vectors to their full potential, a large number of decisions must be made, in some instances prior to even obtaining the vector itself. For example, critical decisions include selection of the proper virus, selection of the proper expression cassette, whether to produce or purchase a viral vector, proper viral handling and storage, the most appropriate delivery method, selecting the proper controls, how to ensure your virus is expressing properly, and many other complex decisions that are essential to performing a successful gene therapy experiment. The need to make so many important decisions can be overwhelming and potentially prohibitive, especially to the novice gene therapist. In order to aid in this challenging process, here we provide an overview of basic gene therapy modalities and a decision tree that can be used to make oneself aware of the options available to the beginning gene therapist. This information can be used as a road map to help navigate the complex and perhaps confusing process of designing a successful gene therapy experiment."
30706380,"The estrogen-related receptor (ERR) α is structurally similar to classical estrogen receptors (ERs), but is considered to be an orphan nuclear receptor. We previously found that ERRα regulates uterine endometrial cancer progression. Here, we investigated the efficacy of XCT790, a selective inverse agonist of ERRα, on endometrial cancer cells in vitro and in vivo."
30706359,"Post-traumatic epilepsy (PTE) is a common long-term risk associated with traumatic brain injury (TBI). PTE rat model, proposed by Willmore et al., is a well known model that mimics human PTE. The present study explored the lipid metabolism in this PTE rat model by using in vitro, high-resolution NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy and lipid staining based investigations. The level of gene expression, cytokines and enzyme activity was estimated. Level of TG (triglycerides), PL (phospholipids) and CHOL (cholesterol) was found to increase in brain tissue of PTE rats. This is an indication of the altered lipid metabolism in PTE rats. Level of lipid peroxidation and cytokines was enhanced in the brain tissue of PTE rats. A positive correlation was also observed in cytokines vs. lipid peroxidation. These results make available the evidence of the oxidative stress induced damage or destruction of the lipid components and also the cause of the inflammatory events in PTE rats. Antioxidant enzyme activity and respective gene expression were found to increase in brain tissue of PTE rats. A positive correlation was also observed in antioxidant enzyme's activity vs. respective enzyme gene expression and lipid peroxidation vs. activity of antioxidant enzymes. Such outcomes reflect the oxidative stress induced lipid damage responsible for production enhancement of antioxidant enzymes, which further responsible for enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. A positive correlation was observed in lipid peroxidation vs. lipid components (TG, PL and CHOL) and provides the confirmatory verification of alteration in the level of lipid components. A negative correlation was observed in the level of cytokines and the quantity of TG. This showed that TG is consumed in the production of cytokines. MUA (Motor unit activity) is highly correlated with the level of LP and indicated that oxidative stress is responsible for the event of epileptogenesis. Positive correlation of MUA with RA (rearing activity) and MWM (Morris-water maze) showed that epileptogenesis also influences the memory of PTE rats. Overall results based analyses clearly indicate that the inflammatory activity and oxidative stress in brain tissue of PTE rats, which are responsible to establish a significant change in the lipid metabolism. This can be visualized through a well constructed possible pathway of altered lipid metabolism. This study will improve our understanding and approach in the field of epilepsy that need to be considered for the development of new drugs or therapy for patients with PTE. Representation of the proposed pathway of altered lipid metabolism in posttraumatic epileptic rats."
30706247,"Prespecified exploratory biomarker analyses of the phase II/III GATSBY study (NCT01641939) assessed whether patient subgroups experienced a survival benefit from trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) versus taxane therapy, and to advance understanding of HER2-positive advanced gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (AGC) disease biology."
30706227,Treatment-resistance genes limiting anticancer therapy have not been well clarified in colorectal cancer (CRC). We explored gene expression profiles to identify biomarkers for predicting treatment resistance to an anticancer drug in CRC.
30706083,"Because of its competitive inhibitor activity against aminopeptidase B, bestatin isolated from the broth of Streptomyces olivoreticuli ATCC 31159 is famous and currently used as an approved therapeutic agent for cancer and bacterial infections. It can be used alone or in combination with other antibiotics or anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy drug for chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Due to the therapeutic importance of bestatin, mining of its biosynthetic mechanism is imperative. Genome mining, one of the bioinformatics-based approaches for the discovery of novel natural product, has been developed and applied widely. Herein, we reported the complete genome of Streptomyces olivoreticuli ATCC 31159 obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). It consists of 8,809,793 base pairs with a linear chromosome, GC content of 71.1%, 7520 protein-coding genes, 75 tRNA operons, 21 rRNA operons, 63 sRNAs. In addition, predictive analysis showed that at least 37 putative biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of the secondary metabolites were obtained, 18 new BGCs with low similarity (< 25%) were included. The availability of novel and abundant gene clusters not only will provide clues for cracking the biosynthetic mechanism of bestatin, but also will provide valuable insight for mining the diverse bioactive compounds based on rational strategies."
30706066,"Cationic polymers have emerged as a promising alternative to viral vectors in gene therapy. They are cheap to scale up, easy to functionalise and are potentially safer than viral vectors, however many are cytotoxic. The large number of polycations, designed to address the toxicity problem, raises a practical need to develop a fast and reliable method for assessing the safety of these materials. In this regard, metabolomics provides a detailed and comprehensive method that can assess the potential toxicity at the cellular and molecular level. Here, we applied metabolomics to investigate the impact of hyperbranched polylysine, hyperbranched polylysine-co-histidine and branched polyethyleneimine polyplexes at sub-toxic concentrations on the metabolic pathways of A459 and H1299 lung carcinoma cell lines. The study revealed that the polyplexes downregulated metabolites associated with glycolysis and the TCA cycle, and induced oxidative stress in both cell lines. The relative changes of the metabolites indicated that the polyplexes of polyethyleneimine and hyperbranched polylysine affected the metabolism much more than the polyplexes of hyperbranched polylysine-co-histidine. This was in line with transfection results, suggesting a correlation between the toxicity and transfection efficiency of these polyplexes. Our work highlights the importance of the metabolomics approach not just to assess the potential toxicity of polyplexes but also to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying any adverse effects, which could help in designing more efficient vectors."
30706038,"Currently available medications for neuropathic pain are of limited efficacy. Moreover, they are administered systemically and are associated with significant side effects. Ideally, one can circumvent systemic side effects if such treatment can be administered by delivery of the therapeutic agent directly to the diseased neurons. Towards this end, we previously reported the production of a recombinant helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd) armed with a tissue-specific homing peptide to deliver transgenes targeting sensory neurons with high efficacy."
30705966,"Rexin-G is a replication-incompetent retroviral vector displaying a cryptic <i>SIG</i>-binding peptide for targeting abnormal Signature (<i>SIG</i>) proteins in tumors and encoding a dominant-negative human cyclin G1 construct. Herein we report on the safety and antitumor activity of escalating doses of Rexin-G in gemcitabine-refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with one 10-year survivor. For the safety analysis (n = 20), treatment-related grade 1 adverse events included fatigue (n = 6), chills (n = 2), and headache (n = 1), with no organ damage and no DLT. No patient tested positive for vector-neutralizing antibodies, antibodies to gp70, replication-competent retrovirus (RCR), or vector integration into genomic DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). For the efficacy analysis (n = 15), one patient achieved a complete response (CR), two patients had a partial response (PR), and 12 had stable disease (SD). Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.7, 4.0, and 5.6 months at doses 0-I, II, and III, respectively. Median overall survival (OS) and 1-year OS rate at dose 0-I were 4.3 months and 0%, and at dose II-III they were 9.2 months and 33.3%. To date, one patient is still alive with no evidence of cancer 10 years after the start of Rexin-G treatment. Taken together, these data suggest that Rexin-G, the first targeted gene delivery system, is uniquely safe and exhibits significant antitumor activity, for which the FDA granted fast-track designation."
30705923,"Hemophilia A (HA) and hemophilia B (HB) are X-linked bleeding disorders due to inheritable deficiencies in either coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) or factor IX (FIX), respectively. Recently, gene therapy clinical trials with adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and protein-engineered transgenes, B-domain deleted (BDD) FVIII and FIX-Padua, have reported near-phenotypic cures in subjects with HA and HB, respectively. Here, we review the biology and the clinical development of FVIII-BDD and FIX-Padua as transgenes. We also examine alternative bioengineering strategies for FVIII and FIX, as well as the immunological challenges of these approaches. Other engineered proteins and their potential use in gene therapy for hemophilia with inhibitors are also discussed. Continued advancement of gene therapy for HA and HB using protein-engineered transgenes has the potential to alleviate the substantial medical and psychosocial burdens of the disease."
30705922,"Elements within the γ-hemoglobin promoters (<i>HBG1</i> and <i>HBG2</i>) function to bind transcription complexes that mediate repression of fetal hemoglobin expression. Sickle cell disease (SCD) subjects with a 13-bp deletion in the <i>HBG1</i> promoter exhibit a clinically favorable hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (HPFH) phenotype. We developed TALENs targeting the homologous <i>HBG</i> promoters to de-repress fetal hemoglobin. Transfection of human CD34<sup>+</sup> cells with TALEN mRNA resulted in indel generation in <i>HBG1</i> (43%) and <i>HBG2</i> (74%) including the 13-bp HPFH deletion (∼6%). Erythroid differentiation of edited cells revealed a 4.6-fold increase in γ-hemoglobin expression as detected by HPLC. Assessment of TALEN-edited CD34<sup>+</sup> cells <i>in vivo</i> in a humanized mouse model demonstrated sustained presence of indels in hematopoietic cells up to 24 weeks. Indel rates remained unchanged following secondary transplantation consistent with editing of long-term repopulating stem cells (LT-HSCs). Human γ-hemoglobin expressing F cells were detected by flow cytometry approximately 50% more frequently in edited animals compared to mock. Together, these findings demonstrate that TALEN-mediated indel generation in the γ-hemoglobin promoter leads to high levels of fetal hemoglobin expression <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>, suggesting that this approach can provide therapeutic benefit in patients with SCD or β-thalassemia."
30705921,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are among the most efficient vectors for liver gene therapy. Results obtained in the first hemophilia clinical trials demonstrated the long-term efficacy of this approach in humans, showing efficient targeting of hepatocytes with both self-complementary (sc) and single-stranded (ss) AAV vectors. However, to support clinical development of AAV-based gene therapies, efficient and scalable production processes are needed. In an effort to translate to the clinic an approach of AAV-mediated liver gene transfer to treat Crigler-Najjar (CN) syndrome, we developed an (ss)AAV8 vector carrying the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase family 1-member A1 (hUGT1A1) transgene under the control of a liver-specific promoter. We compared our construct with similar (sc)AAV8 vectors expressing hUGT1A1, showing comparable potency <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Conversely, (ss)AAV8-hUGT1A1 vectors showed superior yields and product homogeneity compared with their (sc) counterpart. We then focused our efforts in the scale-up of a manufacturing process of the clinical product (ss)AAV8-hUGT1A1 based on the triple transfection of HEK293 cells grown in suspension. Large-scale production of this vector had characteristics identical to those of small-scale vectors produced in adherent cells. Preclinical studies in animal models of the disease and a good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology-biodistribution study were also conducted using large-scale preparations of vectors. These studies demonstrated long-term safety and efficacy of gene transfer with (ss)AAV8-hUGT1A1 in relevant animal models of the disease, thus supporting the clinical translation of this gene therapy approach for the treatment of CN syndrome."
30705797,"Obesity is a disease with a rapidly increasing prevalence all over the world in recent years. Genetic and environmental factors are involved in the etiology of obesity, and the effect of microbiota on obesity is becoming increasingly clear. Obesity treatment has various treatment modalities such as behavior modification, medical nutrition therapy, physical activity enhancement, and surgical intervention. When other treatment methods are not successful, bariatric surgery is usually resorted to as the treatment method. Some changes such as food choices, the level of hormones and enzymes due to anatomical changes, pH of the stomach, and microbiota are observed after bariatric surgery. Alteration in the microbiota composition after bariatric surgery has also been reported to be important in achieving body weight loss and preserving body weight loss."
30705777,"In this review we explore the importance of epigenetics as a contributing factor for aging adult stem cells. We summarize the latest findings of epigenetic factors deregulated as adult stem cells age and the consequence on stem cell self-renewal and differentiation, with a focus on adult stem cells in the bone marrow. With the latest whole genome bisulphite sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitations we are able to decipher an emerging pattern common for adult stem cells in the bone marrow niche and how this might correlate to epigenetic enzymes deregulated during aging. We begin by briefly discussing the initial observations in yeast, drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans (<i>C. elegans</i>) that led to the breakthrough research that identified the role of epigenetic changes associated with lifespan and aging. We then focus on adult stem cells, specifically in the bone marrow, which lends strong support for the deregulation of DNA methyltransferases, histone deacetylases, acetylates, methyltransferases and demethylases in aging stem cells, and how their corresponding epigenetic modifications influence gene expression and the aging phenotype. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic modifications we envisage ""epi"" targeted therapy as a means to reprogram aged stem cells into their younger counterparts."
30705716,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare disease of stricturing and destruction of the biliary tree with a complex genetic and environmental etiology. Most patients have co-occurring inflammatory bowel disease. Children generally present with uncomplicated disease, but undergo a variable progression to end-stage liver disease. Within ten years of diagnosis, 50% of children will develop clinical complications including 30% requiring liver transplantation. Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare but serious complication affecting 1% of children. Ursodeoxycholic acid and oral vancomycin therapy used widely in children as medical therapy, and may be effective in a subset of patients. Gamma glutamyltransferase is a potential surrogate endpoint for disease activity, with improved survival in patients who achieve a normal value. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography is a necessary adjunct to medical therapy to evaluate mass lesions or dominant strictures for malignancy, and also to relieve biliary obstruction. Liver transplantation remains the only option for patients who progress to end-stage liver disease. We review special considerations for patients before and after transplant, and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. There is presently no published treatment algorithm or guideline for the management of children with PSC. We review the evidence for drug efficacy, dosing, duration of therapy, and treatment targets in PSC, and provide a framework for endoscopic and medical management of this complex problem."
30705477,"Invasive fungal diseases (IFDs) are difficult to diagnose and associated with high mortality rates, especially in the immunosuppressed. Species of <i>Aspergillus</i> and <i>Candida</i> are the cause of majority of invasive fungal disease however IFDs are also caused by <i>Fusarium</i>, Zygomycetes, <i>Trichosporon</i>, etc. Early detection is crucial for appropriate antifungal therapy. Blood cultures usually fail to isolate filamentous fungi, while detection of circulating beta-d-glucan or galactomannan antigens show variable sensitivity and specificity. There is a need of reliable, sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for IFDs."

30704988,"The thalassemias are compelling targets for therapeutic genome editing in part because monoallelic correction of a subset of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) would be sufficient for enduring disease amelioration. A primary challenge is the development of efficient repair strategies that are effective in HSCs. Here we demonstrate that allelic disruption of aberrant splice sites, one of the major classes of thalassemia mutations, is a robust approach to restore gene function. We target the IVS1-110G>A mutation using Cas9 ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and the IVS2-654C>T mutation by Cas12a/Cpf1 RNP in primary CD34+ hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) from β-thalassemia patients. Each of these nuclease complexes achieves high efficiency and penetrance of therapeutic edits. Erythroid progeny of edited patient HSPCs show reversal of aberrant splicing and restoration of β-globin expression. This strategy could enable correction of a substantial fraction of transfusion-dependent β-thalassemia genotypes with currently available gene editing technology."
30704961,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) delivery of potent and broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs is a promising approach for the prevention of HIV-1 infection. The immunoglobulin G (IgG)1 subtype is usually selected for this application, because it efficiently mediates antibody effector functions and has a somewhat longer half-life. However, the use of IgG1-Fc has been associated with the generation of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) that correlate with loss of antibody expression. In contrast, we have shown that expression of the antibody-like molecule eCD4-Ig bearing a rhesus IgG2-Fc domain showed reduced immunogenicity and completely protected rhesus macaques from simian-HIV (SHIV)-AD8 challenges. To directly compare the performance of the IgG1-Fc and the IgG2-Fc domains in a prophylactic setting, we compared AAV1 expression of rhesus IgG1 and IgG2 forms of four anti-HIV bNAbs: 3BNC117, NIH45-46, 10-1074, and PGT121. Interestingly, IgG2-isotyped bNAbs elicited significantly lower ADA than their IgG1 counterparts. We also observed significant protection from two SHIV-AD8 challenges in macaques expressing IgG2-isotyped bNAbs, but not from those expressing IgG1. Our data suggest that monoclonal antibodies isotyped with IgG2-Fc domains are less immunogenic than their IgG1 counterparts, and they highlight ADAs as a key barrier to the use of AAV1-expressed bNAbs."
30704833,"Extreme environments are inherently stressful and are characterized by a variety of physical and psychosocial stressors, including, but not limited to, isolation, confinement, social tensions, minimal possibility of medical evacuation, boredom, monotony, and danger. Previous research studies recommend adaptation to the environment to maintain optimal function and remain healthy. Different interventions have been tried in the past for effective management of stress. Yoga practices have been shown to be beneficial for coping with stress and enhance quality of life, sleep and immune status."
30704535,"Human adipose stem cells (ASCs) have emerged as a promising treatment paradigm for skin wounds. Recent works demonstrate that the therapeutic effect of stem cells is partially mediated by extracellular vesicles, which comprise exosomes and microvesicles.

30704465,"While changes in mRNA expression during tumorigenesis have been used widely as molecular biomarkers for the diagnosis of a number of cancers, the approach has limitations. For example, traditional methods do not consider the regulatory and positional relationship between mRNA and lncRNA. The latter has been largely shown to possess tumor suppressive or oncogenic properties. The combined analysis of mRNA and lncRNA is likely to facilitate the identification of biomarkers with higher confidence."
30704460,"While most pediatric sarcomas respond to front-line therapy, some bone sarcomas do not show radiographic response like soft-tissue sarcomas (rhabdomyosarccomas) but do show 90% necrosis. Though, new therapies are urgently needed to improve survival and quality of life in pediatric patients with sarcomas. Complex chromosomal aberrations such as amplifications and deletions of DNA sequences are frequently observed in pediatric sarcomas. Evaluation of copy number variations (CNVs) associated with pediatric sarcoma patients at the time of diagnosis or following therapy offers an opportunity to assess dysregulated molecular targets and signaling pathways that may drive sarcoma development, progression, or relapse. The objective of this study was to utilize publicly available data sets to identify potential predictive biomarkers of chemotherapeutic response in pediatric Osteosarcoma (OS), Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) and Ewing's Sarcoma Family of Tumors (ESFTs) based on CNVs following chemotherapy (OS n = 117, RMS n = 64, ESFTs n = 25 tumor biopsies)."
30704449,"Predicting cellular responses to drugs has been a major challenge for personalized drug therapy regimen. Recent pharmacogenomic studies measured the sensitivities of heterogeneous cell lines to numerous drugs, and provided valuable data resources to develop and validate computational approaches for the prediction of drug responses. Most of current approaches predict drug sensitivity by building prediction models with individual genes, which suffer from low reproducibility due to biologic variability and difficulty to interpret biological relevance of novel gene-drug associations. As an alternative, pathway activity scores derived from gene expression could predict drug response of cancer cells."

30704300,"Gene and drug delivery systems need crucial update in the issue of nanocarriers. Layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are known as biocompatible inorganic lamellar nanomaterials with versatile properties. In the present study, Zn/Al-LDH nanoparticle was synthesized and characterized by FTIR, XRD, SEM, TEM and Zeta potential tests and then intercalated with valproate and methyldopa by co-precipitation and ion exchange methods. These nanocarriers were applied as high activity nanolayers-based delivery systems. On the other hand, Zn/Al-LDH + plasmid/gene (pCEP4/Cdk9) evaluated on C2C12 myoblast cells. Co-operation loading indicated high efficiency of sorting and release of drugs. Additionally, the Real-Time PCR and Western blotting results for plasmid-gene (pCEP4/Cdk9) delivery showed that Zn/Al-LDH nanoparticles can be used as an effective carrier in cellular uptake and release of genes for gene therapy. Easy and cost-effective production of Zn/Al-LDH nanoparticles proposed them as potential alternatives for the traditional routs of drug/gene delivery."
30704255,"Proproteinconvertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) expression. Anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibody (MAb) therapy reduces LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) by ~60 % and reduces also the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events. Mendelian randomisation studies showed that patients carrying loss-of-function PCSK9 genetic variants display lower LDL-C and have an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Randomized controlled trials with anti-PCSK9 MAbs however showed no effect on the risk. A possible explanation of the discrepancy is that the deficiency of locally but not circulating PCSK9 is responsible for increased LDLR expression in pancreatic islets, which results in cholesterol accumulation and B-cell dysfunction. Thus PCSK9 lowering therapy with MAb targeting mainly circulating PCSK9 might have a limited impact on LDLR expression in pancreatic cells and on the risk of T2DM. Long-term clinical trials are however needed to confirm it. Key words: diabetes mellitus - LDL receptor - PCSK9."
30704144,"Haematopoiesis is a tightly orchestrated process where a pool of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) with high self-renewal potential can give rise to both lymphoid and myeloid lineages. The HSPCs pool is reduced with ageing resulting in few HSPC clones maintaining haematopoiesis thereby reducing blood cell diversity, a phenomenon called clonal haematopoiesis. Clonal expansion of HSPCs carrying specific genetic mutations leads to increased risk for haematological malignancies. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that hematopoietic tumours develop in higher frequency in elderly people. Unfortunately, elderly patients with leukaemia or lymphoma still have an unsatisfactory prognosis compared to younger ones highlighting the need to develop more efficient therapies for this group of patients. Growing evidence indicates that macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy) is essential for health and longevity. This review is focusing on the role of autophagy in normal haematopoiesis as well as in leukaemia and lymphoma development. Attenuated autophagy may support early hematopoietic neoplasia whereas activation of autophagy in later stages of tumour development and in response to a variety of therapies rather triggers a pro-tumoral response. Novel insights into the role of autophagy in haematopoiesis will be discussed in light of designing new autophagy modulating therapies in hematopoietic cancers."
30703787,"Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, and its incidence and mortality are increasing year by year in China. In 2018, for the first time, the FIT-DNA test was written into the expert consensus as the recommended screening technology in China. As the core technology of colorectal cancer screening, colonoscopy for right colon cancer is further supported. With the application of artificial intelligence technology in colonoscopy, the efficiency and accuracy of screening will be greatly improved. New screening technologies represented by circulating tumor cell (CTC) and individualized screening programs based on molecular genetics are future directions. As the core of colorectal cancer treatment, surgery has become quite mature. Traditional laparoscopic surgery has become an optimal choice for colorectal cancer surgery. Open surgery, robotic surgery and single-incision laparoscopic surgery have not been found superior to multiport laparoscopic surgery. The focus of surgical research is to precisely select surgical methods, and to protect normal physiological function of patients. For example, in order to reduce complications and improve quality of life in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery after neoadjuvant radiotherapy, the ""Tianhe surgery"" was invented by the authors' team. Chemotherapy as the basis of colorectal cancer treatment has shown good results in many aspects: The PRODIGE-7 trial has confirmed that systemic chemotherapy is more important for colorectal peritoneal metastasis after high quality cytoreductive surgery (CRS). While the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with oxaliplatin does not result in the better overall survival (OS), but increases the risk of postoperative complications. The FOWARC study has found that the FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin and fluorouracil) achieved a 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate similar to that of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, challenging the clinical value of radiotherapy. Although several studies have confirmed that total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) can improve pathological complete response (pCR) rate and DFS of patients with colorectal cancer, we do not recommend unretricted expansion of chemotherapy. How to combine the clinical characteristics and molecular biological markers to select high-risk groups for chemotherapy, and how to use personalized medicine according to the genetic characteristics of patients, are also hot spots of current research. Immunotherapy is a game-changer in all aspects of colorectal cancer. In order to adapt to the immune therapy, the efficacy evaluation standard of solid tumors (iRECIST) has been revised. Immune score could redefine tumor clinical staging system. Both the Checkmate-142 study for advanced tumors and the NCT03026140 study on neoadjuvant treatment for early tumors showed promising results. Although no significant progress has been seen in the EGFR-targeted therapy and VEGFR-targeted therapy, new targeted drugs such as Eltanexor (ETLA, kpt -8602) and cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) have been found to be effective in clinical studies. According to the detection results of tumor-related signaling pathways in patients, cross-guidance selection of targeted drug therapy is also the direction of research. Although the IWWD research results give a big blow to the ""watch and wait"" strategy, with the exploration of TNT plan, more accurate imaging efficacy evaluation and the application of immunotherapy, the ""watch and wait"" strategy will also receive new attention. In recent years, we have seen the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology. Although it is still in the exploratory stage in the field of medicine, it will certainly reshape all aspects of colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment in the future, leading the research direction."
30703786,"China is a country with high incidence of gastric cancer, most of which are advanced gastric cancer, accounting for about half of the new cases in the world. Environmental factors play a crucial role in the occurrence and development of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori and Epstein Barr virus(EBV) infection have been confirmed as one of the important pathogenic factors of gastric cancer. With the development and application of molecular biology and sequencing technology, molecular typing based on patient genetic characteristics has been proposed to guide accurate treatment and predict prognosis. Surgery is the cornerstone of gastric cancer treatment. Laparoscopy has been developing rapidly in the past 20 years on account of its clinical application advantages such as minimally invasive and magnified visual field and refined anatomy, making it one of the standard treatment options for early gastric cancer, with its indications for the treatment of gastric cancer continuously expanding. The application of endoscopic treatment and reduction surgery for early gastric cancer further improves the quality of life of patients, and surgical treatment of gastric cancer tends to be precise and minimally invasive. The comprehensive treatment of surgery combined with radiotherapy and chemotherapy is a standard treatment of local advanced gastric cancer. The exploration of related drugs and treatment models is the current research hotspot, and the development and application of targeted therapy and immunotherapy provide more choices in this field. The treatment of advanced gastric cancer is focused on the exploration of chemotherapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy. Some studies have shown good prospects and provided more opportunities for conversion therapy. This article will share the new developments in the field of gastric cancer research in 2018."

30703670,The 21-gene recurrence score (Oncotype DX) (RS) informs systemic therapy decision making in ER-positive HER2-negative early breast cancer (BC). To date no study has described the more nuanced discussions that take place regarding systemic therapy or the impact of the RS on concordance in such decision making. Here we utilized a novel decision making tool to assess the impact of the RS on decision making as well as concordance of treatment recommendations.

SBRT preclinical modeling is now possible, and our aim was to develop a model of focal irradiation of the mouse lung and to investigate the impact of conditional HIF-1α deletion in the endothelium on radiation-induced tissue damage."
30703373,"The major obstacle in current cancer therapy is the existence of cancer stem cells (CSCs), which are responsible for therapeutic resistance and contribute to metastasis and recurrence. Identification of reliable biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic targets is necessary for drug development and cancer treatment. In this study, we identified that the antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CPZ) exhibited potent anti-breast cancer and anti-CSC capabilities. Treatment with CPZ suppressed stemness properties including mammosphere formation, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity, and stemness-related gene expressions in breast cancer cells and CSCs. Moreover, CPZ increased the susceptibility of breast cancer MCF7 cells and drug-resistant MCF7/ADR cells when combined with chemotherapies. Mechanistically, we identified that CPZ suppressed yes-associated protein (YAP) through modulating Hippo signaling and promoting proteasomal degradation of YAP. Elevated expression of YAP was confirmed to be crucial for stemness-related gene expressions, and was associated with invasiveness and stem-like signatures in breast cancer patients. Moreover, overexpression of YAP conferred poor outcomes particularly of basal-like breast cancer patients. Our data showed that YAP is a promising therapeutic target for breast CSCs, and CPZ has the potential to be a repurposed drug for breast cancer treatment."
30703243,"Type IV collagen is a component of the extracellular matrix in the basement membrane. Abnormal secretion or assembly of type IV collagen may lead to kidney lesions resulting in numerous nephropathy symptoms, e.g., Alport syndrome, thin basement membrane nephropathy, and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Treatment for type IV collagen-related nephropathy includes drugs, kidney transplantation, gene and cell therapy. However, drugs are not always effective, and kidney transplantation is hindered by the shortage of donors. Moreover, basement membrane nephritis often occurs after kidney transplantation. Therefore, gene and cell therapy probably is the most promising treatment for type IV collagen related nephropathies."
30703064,"Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP) is a heterogeneous group of rare endocrine disorders characterised by normal renal function and renal resistance to the action of the parathyroid hormone. Type 1A (PHP1A), which is the most common variant, also include developmental and skeletal defects named as Albright hereditary osteodystrophy (AHO). We present two cases, a 54- and a 33-year-old male diagnosed with PHP who were referred to us for persistently high levels of serum calcitonin. AHO and multinodular goitre were present in the 54-year-old male, while the second patient was free of skeletal deformities and his thyroid gland was of normal size and without nodular appearance. We performed GNAS molecular analysis (methylation status and copy number analysis by MS-MLPA) in genomic DNA samples for both patients. The analysis revealed a novel missense variant c.131T>G p.(Leu44Pro) affecting GNAS exon 1, in the patient with the clinical diagnosis of PHP1A. This amino acid change appears to be in accordance with the clinical diagnosis of the patient. The genomic DNA analysis of the second patient revealed the presence of the recurrent 3-kb deletion affecting the imprinting control region localised in the STX16 region associated with the loss of methylation (LOM) at the GNAS A/B differentially methylated region and consistent with the diagnosis of an autosomal dominant form of PHP type 1B (PHP1B). In conclusion, hypercalcitoninaemia may be encountered in PHP1A and PHP1B even in the absence of thyroid pathology. Learning points: We describe a novel missense variant c.131T>G p.(Leu44Pro) affecting GNAS exon 1 as the cause of PHP1A. Hypercalcitoninaemia in PHP1A is considered an associated resistance to calcitonin, as suggested by the generalised impairment of Gsα-mediated hormone signalling. GNAS methylation defects, as in type PHP1B, without thyroid pathology can also present with hypercalcitoninaemia."
30703060,"Background Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is a genetic disorder due to loss of expression of paternally transcribed genes of the imprinted region of chromosome 15q11-13. PWS is characterized by peculiar signs and symptoms and many endocrine abnormalities have been described (growth hormone deficiency, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). The abnormalities of thyroid function are discussed in literature and published data are discordant. The aim of our study was to report the thyroid function in patients with PWS to identify the prevalence of thyroid dysfunction. Methods Thyroid function tests were carried out in 339 patients with PWS, aged from 0.2 to 50 years. A database was created to collect personal data, anthropometric data, thyroid function data and possible replacement therapy with L-thyroxine. Subjects were classified according to thyroid function as: euthyroidism (EuT), congenital hypothyroidism (C-HT), hypothyroidism (HT - high thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH] and low free thyroxine [fT4]), central hypothyroidism (CE-H - low/normal TSH and low fT4), subclinical hypothyroidism (SH - high TSH and normal fT4), and hyperthyroidism (HyperT - low TSH and high fT4). Results Two hundred and forty-three out of 339 PWS patients were younger than 18 years (71.7%). The prevalence of thyroid dysfunction was 13.6%. Specifically, C-HT was found in four children (1.18%), HT in six patients (1.77%), CE-H in 23 patients (6.78%), SH in 13 patients (3.83%), and HyperT in none. All other subjects were in EuT (86.4%). Conclusions Hypothyroidism is a frequent feature in subjects with PWS. Thyroid function should be regularly investigated in all PWS patients both at the diagnosis and annually during follow-up."
30702994,"Loss-of-function variants in PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9) are associated with lower lifetime risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease) events. Confirmation of these genetic observations in large, prospective clinical trials in participants with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease has provided guidance on risk stratification and enhanced our knowledge on hitherto unresolved and contentious issues concerning the efficacy and safety of markedly lowering LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). PCSK9 has a broad repertoire of molecular effects. Furthermore, clinical trials with PCSK9 inhibitors demonstrate that reductions in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease events are more effective in patients with recent myocardial infarction, multiple myocardial infarctions, multivessel coronary artery disease, and lower extremity arterial disease. The potent LDL-C lowering efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors provides the opportunity for more aggressive LDL-lowering strategies in high-risk patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and supports the notion that there is no lower limit for LDL-C. Aggressive LDL-C lowering with fully human PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies has been associated by a safety profile superior to that of other classes of LDL-lowering agents. These clinical trials provide evidence that LDL lowering with PCSK9 inhibitors is an effective therapy for lowering cardiovascular events in high-risk patients with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL on maximally tolerated oral therapies, including statins and ezetimibe."
30702991,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide. To date, decades of research has established LDL-C (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) as a causal factor in the development of atherosclerotic CVD. Statin therapy, supported by a broad evidence base, has demonstrated its superior efficacy in reducing LDL-C and subsequent cardiovascular risk. It therefore currently forms the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy as recommended by international guidelines. Statin therapy is indicated in the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic CVD, as well as genetic causes of dyslipidemia (such as familial hypercholesterolemia). Although this strategy targets those most at risk, it merely addresses those most susceptible and does not account for the fact that most cardiovascular events occur in those at moderate to low risk. In addition, there is evidence for use in primary prevention such as in those with diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and high risk of future atherosclerotic CVD as determined by risk prediction calculators. Risk prediction tools, however, are far from perfect and do not accurately account for those at low short-term but high lifelong risk. Considering the log-linear relationship between LDL-C reductions and reductions in risk of atherosclerotic CVD, even in those at very low risk of future events, a clinical question posed is can we and should we shift the entire risk distribution by treating everyone? The present review discusses these issues in more detail outlining arguments for and against each approach."
30702927,"It has been shown that 5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide riboside (AICAr) can inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) cells. Although AICAr could regulate cellular energy metabolism by activating AMPK, the cytotoxic mechanisms of AICAr are still unclear. Here, we knocked out TP53 or PRKAA1 gene (encoding AMPKα1) in NALM-6 and Reh cells by using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/Cas9 system and found that AICAr-induced proliferation inhibition was independent of AMPK activation but dependent on p53. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of nucleotide metabolites indicated that AICAr caused an increase in adenosine triphosphate, deoxyadenosine triphosphate, and deoxyguanosine triphosphate levels by up-regulating purine biosynthesis, while AICAr led to a decrease in cytidine triphosphate, uridine triphosphate, deoxycytidine triphosphate, and deoxythymidine triphosphate levels because of reduced phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate production, which consequently impaired the pyrimidine biosynthesis. Ribonucleoside triphosphate (NTP) pool imbalances suppressed the rRNA transcription efficiency. Furthermore, deoxy-ribonucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) pool imbalances induced DNA replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks, followed by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in ALL cells. Exogenous uridine could rebalance the NTP and dNTP pools by supplementing pyrimidine and then attenuate AICAr-induced cytotoxicity. Our data indicate that RNA transcription inhibition and DNA replication stress induced by NTP and dNTP pool imbalances might play a key role in AICAr-mediated cytotoxic effects on ALL cells, suggesting a potential clinical application of AICAr in future ALL therapy.-Du, L., Yang, F., Fang, H., Sun, H., Chen, Y., Xu, Y., Li, H., Zheng, L., Zhou, B.-B.

30702899,"Histone deacetylases, HDACs, have been demonstrated to play a critical role in epigenetic signaling and were found to be overexpressed in several type of cancers, therefore they represent valuable targets for anticancer therapy. 9-Hydroxystearic acid has been shown to bind the catalytic site of HDAC1, inducing G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and activation of p21WAF1 gene, thus promoting cells growth inhibition and differentiation in many cancer cells. Despite the (R) enantiomer of 9-hydroxystearic acid (9R) displayed promising in vitro growth-inhibitory effect on HT29 cell line, its scarce water solubility and micromolar activity require novel solutions for improving its efficacy and bioavailability. In this work, we describe the synthesis and in vitro biological profiling of 9R keratin nanoparticles (9R@ker) obtained through an in-water drug-induced aggregation process. The anticancer activity of 9R@ker was investigated in HT29 cell line: the results indicate an increased fluidity of cell membrane and a higher intracellular ROS formation, resulting in an unexpected S phase cell cycle arrest (25% increase as compared to the control) induced by 9R@ker as respect to free 9R and an induction of cell death."

30702270,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a series of promising molecules that could regulate gene expression, while its expression level and type are strictly related to the early diagnosis, targeted therapy and prognostic of diseases. Improved detection accuracy of miRNAs would lead to unprecedented progress in early treatment. Numerous methods to improve sensitivity have been proposed and confirmed valuable in miRNAs detection recently. However, the research which especially targets at improving detection specificity remains rare. This paper gave a retrospective summary of the most common detection methods including Northern blot, Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, Next-generation sequencing, and Microarray. Common methods play an important role in many aspects because of maturity and stability. However, the problem of specificity still exists. Then, this paper summarized breakthroughs in traditional techniques which are closely related to progressive methods to improve specificity. In addition, considerable studies focus on improving accuracy are described in detail. Most of them involve the reasonable combination of common methods, and the strategies that contribute to improving accuracy are classified. This paper aims to illustrate the importance of detection accuracy and explore how to improve specificity on detecting miRNAs, especially homologous families."

30701951,"Prolyl-4-hydroxylases of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-P4Hs) are enzymes that, under the conditions of normoxia, cause degradation of the HIF-transcriptional protein, which regulates a number of metabolic processes, including erythropoiesis, glucose level and lipid metabolism. In hypoxic conditions, on the contrary, their activity is suppressed and HIF stabilization takes place. This mechanism, i.e. stabilization of HIF by inhibition of HIF-P4Hs was the basis for the development of drugs designed for treatment of renal anemia, which are currently in stages 2 and 3 of clinical trials and are showing encouraging results. Recently, it has also been reported that inhibition of HIF-P4Hs can be effective in treatment of cardiometabolic diseases - coronary heart disease, hypertension, obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetic cardiomyopathy and atherosclerosis. The review, based on the most recent data, discusses in detail molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effect of HIF-P4Hs inhibition in these pathological conditions and provides evidence that these mechanisms are associated with HIF stabilization and gene expression, improving perfusion and endothelial function, reprogramming metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis, reducing inflammation and having beneficial effect on the innate immune system."
30701932,"B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) is a diverse group of malignant blood disorders both with regard to the biological properties of the tumor and to therapeutic approaches. Immunophenotyping, molecular genetic techniques, whole-genome sequencing characterize B-ALL as a very diverse group for sensitivity to chemotherapy and prognosis. We present three clinical cases of patients with B-ALL and expected good response to standard therapy, in whom standard protocol treatment failured: refractoriness, persistence of minimal residual disease (MRD), and progression (MRD increase). The remission in these patients was achieved after chemotherapy change to immunological targeted therapy. Nowadays a unified therapeutic approach to all primary patients of the B-ALL is considered generally outdated. Great efforts are carrying out to develop molecular genetic classifications. The molecular dissection of subtypes of B-ALL goes on, and new protocols for selective treatment with targeting are clearly outlined for each subtype of B-ALL."
30701930,This article describes several clinical cases of acute ischemic stroke among patients suffering from essential thrombocytemia. Ambiguity of etiological factors of stroke is demonstrated among patients with this pathology. Thrombocytosis and high allele load in the Jak2 gene play an important role (even with normal platelet count) in progression of cerebrovascular disease. Also the question of effectiveness of preventive and etiological therapy is considered.

30701765,"Personalized medicine (personalized medicine, individualized medicine) represents the totality of methods of prevention of a pathological condition, diagnosis and treatment in the event of its occurrence, based on individual patient characteristics. Such individual characteristics include genetic, epigenetic, and transcript, proteome, metabolomic and metagenomic markers, as well as a set of variable phenotypic traits - both of the patient's body and its separate tissues or cells. For example, treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) can most clearly show the importance of applying personalized approaches. Currently in the treatment of patients with IBD paid great attention to genetic studies, monitoring of the concentration of the biological drugs and the level of antibodies to them, the role of microbiota as a predictor of effectiveness of therapy of IBD. Used clinical, laboratory, instru- mental methods, as well as new biomarkers to assess the forecasting efficiency of conservative therapy in IBD patient. In the future treatment of patients with IBD will include a number of personalized data in order to better predict outcomes of the disease in each patient and more ac- curately select the appropriate treatment regimen."
30701745,"Family hyperaldosteronism type I (glucocorticoids-remediable hyperaldosteronism) is a rare form of symptomatic arterial hypertension (AH), which often leads to the development of cerebrovascular complications. The disease is caused by the formation of the chimeric gene CYP11B2/CYP11B1.  Expression of the chimeric gene is regulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone, and glucocorticoid therapy leads to a decrease in aldosterone secretion and normalization of blood pressure. The article presents the first clinical case of this monogenic disease diagnosed by us in Russia. The features of clinical course and treatment of the patient have been traced in the dynamics for 40 years of observation. Modern approaches to the diagnosis and treatment of this rare family form of hypertension are discussed."
30701409,"Inherited monogenic disorders such as beta-hemoglobinopathies (BH) are fitting candidates for treatment via gene therapy by gene transfer or gene editing. The reported safety and efficacy of lentiviral vectors in preclinical studies have led to the development of several clinical trials for the addition of a functional beta-globin gene. Across trials, dozens of transfusion-dependent patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT) have been treated via gene therapy and have achieved reduced transfusion requirements. While overall results are encouraging, the outcomes appear to be strongly influenced by the level of lentiviral integration in transduced cells after engraftment, as well as the underlying genotype resulting in thalassemia. In addition, the method of procurement of hematopoietic stem cells can affect their quality and thus the outcome of gene therapy both in SCD and TDT. This suggests that new studies aimed at maximizing the number of corrected cells with long-term self-renewal potential are crucial to ensure successful treatment for every patient. Recent advancements in gene transfer and bone marrow transplantation have improved the success of this approach, and the results obtained by using these strategies demonstrated significant improvement of gene transfer outcome in patients. The advent of new gene-editing technologies has suggested additional therapeutic options. These are primarily focused on correcting the defective beta-globin gene or editing the expression of genes or genomic segments that regulate fetal hemoglobin synthesis. In this review, we aim to establish the potential benefits of gene therapy for BH, to summarize the status of the ongoing trials, and to discuss the possible improvement or direction for future treatments."
30701326,"Tumor cells generally exhibit higher levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), however, when stressed, tumor cells can undergo a process of 'Redox Resetting' to acquire a new redox balance with stronger antioxidant systems that enable cancer cells to become resistant to radiation therapy (RT). Here, we describe how RT affects the oxidant/antioxidant balance in human embryonal (RD) and alveolar (RH30) rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) cell lines, investigating on the molecular mechanisms involved."

30701102,"The number of pediatric cancer survivors is growing, and they are getting older. Therapy-induced cardiotoxicity therefore is debated as an ongoing problem. Recognition of the side effects in the use of anthracyclines and radiation as well as the patients' clinical condition and comorbidities leads back as far as the beginning of systematic cancer treatment in children in the 1980s. Since, numerous case reports, meta-analyses and retrospective surveys were published worldwide. However, randomized clinical trials with standardized protocols yet fail to be designed. This article gives an overview of the recent reports and emphasizes on the heterogeneity of the different approaches. A standardized work-up which may identify the patient at risk-including the patient's history and condition, individual genetic dispositions, dosage and method of drug application, consideration of co-medication, radiation therapy and dose, standardized imaging methods-is the main proposition of our report. The fusion of already established sources, e.g., data of different registries or study centers, might help to create preventive strategies for and a better understanding of patients with therapy induced cardiomyopathy."
30701019,"PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that partner with PIWI proteins to protect germline tissues from destabilizing transposon activity. While the aberrant expression of PIWI proteins has been linked with poor outcomes for many cancers, less is known about the expression or function of piRNAs in cancer. We performed array-based piRNA expression profiling in seven pairs of normal brain and glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) tissue specimens, and identified expression of ~350 piRNAs in both tissues and a subset with dysregulated expression in GBM. Over-expression of the most down-regulated piRNA in GBM tissue, piR-8041, was found to reduce glioma cell line proliferation, induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, and inhibit cell survival pathways. Furthermore, pre-treatment with piR-8041 significantly reduced the volume of intracranial mouse xenograft tumors. Taken together, our study reveals reduced expression in GBM of piR-8041 and other piRNAs with tumor suppressive properties, and suggests that restoration of such piRNAs may be a potential strategy for GBM therapy."
30700935,"Gastrointestinal (GI) cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Tumor markers are valuable in detecting post-surgical recurrence or in monitoring response to chemotherapy. Pyruvate kinase isoform M2 (PKM2), a glycolytic enzyme catalyzing conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, confers a growth advantage to the tumor cells and enables them to adapt to the tumor microenvironment. In this review, we have summarized current research on the expression and regulation of PKM2 in tumor cells, and its potential role in GI carcinogenesis and progression. Furthermore, we have also discussed the potential of PKM2 as a diagnostic and screening marker, and a therapeutic target in GI cancer."
30700849,"In human idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), collapse of distal airspaces occurs in areas of the lung not (yet) remodeled. Mice lungs overexpressing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) recapitulate this abnormality: surfactant dysfunction results in alveolar collapse preceding fibrosis and loss of alveolar epithelial type II (AE2) cells' apical membrane surface area. Here we examined whether surfactant dysfunction-related alveolar collapse due to TGF-β1 overexpression is linked to septal wall remodeling and AE2 cell abnormalities. Three and 6 days after gene transfer of TGF-β1, mice received either intratracheal surfactant (Surf-groups: Curosurf®, 100 mg/kg bodyweight) or 0.9% NaCl (Saline-groups). On days 7 (D7) and 14 (D14), lung mechanics were assessed followed by design-based stereology at light and electron microscopic level to quantify structures. Compared with Saline, Surf showed significantly improved tissue elastance, increased numbers of open alveoli, as well as reduced alveolar size heterogeneity on D7. Deterioration in lung mechanics was highly correlated to the loss of open alveoli. On D14, lung mechanics, number of open alveoli, and alveolar size heterogeneity remained significantly improved in the Surf-group. Volumes of extracellular matrix and collagen fibrils in septal walls were significantly reduced, whereas the apical membrane surface area of AE2 cells was increased in Surf compared with Saline. In remodeled tissue with collapsed alveoli, three-dimensional reconstruction of AE2 cells based on scanning electron microscopy array tomography revealed that AE2 cells were trapped without contact to airspaces in the TGF-β1 mouse model. Similar observations were made in human IPF. Based on correlation analyses, the number of open alveoli and of alveolar size heterogeneity were highly linked with the loss of apical membrane surface area of AE2 cells and deposition of collagen fibrils in septal walls on D14. In conclusion, surfactant replacement therapy stabilizes alveoli and prevents extracellular matrix deposition in septal walls in the TGF-β1 model."
30700828,"The CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib reduces tumor growth by decreasing retinoblastoma (RB) protein phosphorylation and inducing cell cycle arrest at the G1/S phase transition. Palbociclib in combination with anti-hormonal therapy brings significant benefit to breast cancer patients. In this study, novel combination approaches and underlying molecular/cellular mechanisms for palbociclib were explored in squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC), the second most common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. While approximate 20% lung patients benefit from immunotherapy, most SqCLC patients who receive platinum-doublet chemotherapy as first-line treatment, which often includes a taxane, are still in need of more effective combination therapies. Our results demonstrated enhanced cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effect with palbociclib plus taxanes at clinically achievable doses in multiple SqCLC models with diverse cancer genetic backgrounds. Comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed a sustained disruption of pRB-E2F signaling by combination that was accompanied with enhanced regulation of pleiotropic biological effects. These included several novel mechanisms such as abrogation of G2/M and mitotic spindle assembly checkpoints, as well as impaired induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α). The decrease in HIF-1α modulated a couple key angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors, resulting in an enhanced anti-angiogenic effect. This preclinical work suggests a new therapeutic opportunity for palbociclib in lung and other cancers currently treated with taxane based chemotherapy as standard of care."
30700805,"Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic hyperlipidemia characterized by elevated concentrations of plasma LDL cholesterol. Statins are not always effective for the treatment of FH patients; unresponsive patients have poor prognosis and rely on LDL apheresis. In the past, we developed safe and effective gene therapy strategies for the expression of anti-atherogenic proteins using PEGylated helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors. We recently developed a HD-Ad vector for the expression of the soluble form of the extracellular portion of the human LDL receptor (LDLR) fused with a rabbit transferrin dimer (LDLR-TF). We evaluated the efficacy of the LDLR-TF chimeric protein  in CHOLDLA7, a cell line lacking LDLR expression, restoring the ability to uptake LDL. Subsequently, we administered intravenously 1 × 10E13 vp/kg of this vector in LDLR-deficient mice and observed amelioration of lipid profile and reduction of aortic atherosclerosis. Finally, we studied LDL distribution after HD-Ad vector-mediated expression of LDLR-TF in LDLR-deficient mice and found LDL accumulation in liver, and in heart and intestine. These results support the possibility of lowering LDL-C levels and reducing aortic atherosclerosis using a secreted therapeutic transgene; the present strategy potentially can be modified and adapted to non-systemic gene transfer with expression of the secreted chimeric protein in muscle or other tissues. Intramuscular or local administration strategies could improve the safety profile of this strategy and facilitate applicability."
30700722,"There is an urgent need to develop the next-generation vectors for gene therapy of muscle disorders, given the relatively modest advances in clinical trials. These vectors should express substantially higher levels of the therapeutic transgene, enabling the use of lower and safer vector doses. In the current study, we identify potent muscle-specific transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), containing clusters of transcription factor binding sites, using a genome-wide data-mining strategy. These novel muscle-specific CRMs result in a substantial increase in muscle-specific gene transcription (up to 400-fold) when delivered using adeno-associated viral vectors in mice. Significantly higher and sustained human micro-dystrophin and follistatin expression levels are attained than when conventional promoters are used. This results in robust phenotypic correction in dystrophic mice, without triggering apoptosis or evoking an immune response. This multidisciplinary approach has potentially broad implications for augmenting the efficacy and safety of muscle-directed gene therapy."
30700717,"The mechanisms controlling CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell switching from an effector to an anti-inflammatory (IL-10<sup>+</sup>) phenotype play an important role in the persistence of chronic inflammatory diseases. Here, we identify the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway as a key regulator of this process. Pathway analysis of cultured cytokine-producing human T cells reveals a significant association between IL-10 and cholesterol metabolism gene expression. Inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway with atorvastatin or 25-hydroxycholesterol during switching from IFNγ<sup>+</sup> to IL-10<sup>+</sup> shows a specific block in immune resolution, defined as a significant decrease in IL-10 expression. Mechanistically, the master transcriptional regulator of IL10 in T cells, c-Maf, is significantly decreased by physiological levels of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Strikingly, progression to rheumatoid arthritis is associated with altered expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes in synovial biopsies of predisposed individuals. Our data reveal a link between sterol metabolism and the regulation of the anti-inflammatory response in human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells."
30700693,"BACKGROUND Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) in children is a rare life-threatening syndrome, characterized by microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia with renal dysfunction, neurologic symptoms, and fever. TTP is usually caused by deficient activity of von Willebrand factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13), due to either gene mutations or acquired via anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies. It can be triggered by bone marrow or solid organ transplantation, cardiothoracic-, abdominal-, and orthopedic surgeries, infections including very rarely Helicobacter pylori infection. CASE REPORT Here we report a case of a 16-year-old male with TTP, who presented with thrombocytopenia before an appendectomy. Seven days after surgery, our patient started to vomit, developed melena, and was admitted to our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) with clinical presentation of shock. Gastroscopy revealed H. pylori positive hemorrhagic gastritis. The patient was treated by erythrocyte transfusions, fresh frozen plasma, human albumin, glucose-electrolyte solutions, vitamin K, platelet transfusion before implantation of central venous catheter, and antibiotics. After 36 hours, we started plasma exchange (PEX). Blood tests showed deficiency of ADAMTS13. Due to the presence of anti-ADAMTS13 autoantibodies, rituximab was administered. Due to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, he was artificially ventilated. Brain MR angiography showed small ischemic cerebro-vascular insult in the arteria cerebri media region. Despite immunosuppressive therapy and PEX, the patient did not improve completely until the H. pylori infection was eradicated. After which, he recovered completely. CONCLUSIONS We present a rare case of TTP accompanied with appendicitis and gastritis caused by H. pylori, where TTP improvement was dependent on H. pylori infection eradication."
30700309,"Hormone-dependent gene expression involves dynamic and orchestrated regulation of epigenome leading to a cancerous state. Estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer rely on chromatin remodeling and association with epigenetic factors in inducing ER-dependent oncogenesis and thus cell over-proliferation. The mechanistic differences between epigenetic regulation and hormone signaling provide an avenue for combination therapy of ER-positive breast cancer. We hypothesized that epigenetic biomarkers within single nucleosome proximity of ER-dependent genes could serve as potential therapeutic targets. We described here a Fluorescence lifetime imaging-based Förster resonance energy transfer (FLIM-FRET) methodology for biomarker screening that could facilitate combination therapy based on our study. We screened 11 epigenetic-related markers which include oxidative forms of DNA methylation, histone modifications, and methyl-binding domain proteins. Among them, we identified H4K12acetylation (H4K12ac) and H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) as potential epigenetic therapeutic targets. When histone acetyltransferase inhibitor targeting H4K12ac and H3K27ac was combined with tamoxifen, an enhanced therapeutic outcome was observed against ER-positive breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. Together, we demonstrate a single molecule approach as an effective screening tool for devising targeted epigenetic therapy."
30700254,"Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a tumour arising from pleural cavities with poor prognosis. Multimodality treatment with pemetrexed combined with cisplatin shows unsatisfying response-rates of 40%. The reasons for the rather poor efficacy of chemotherapeutic treatment are largely unknown. However, it is conceivable that DNA repair mechanisms lead to an impaired therapy response. We hypothesize a major role of homologous recombination (HR) for genome stability and survival of this tumour. Therefore, we analysed genes compiled under the term ""BRCAness"". An inhibition of this pathway with olaparib might abrogate this effect and induce apoptosis."
30700240,"Insights into the Pathogenesis of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases: Genetics and Microbiota Abstract. An inadequate immune response against bacteria of the gastrointestinal tract is the basic mechanism mediating the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). The risk of IBD is partially heritable and approximately 12 % of patients have a family history of IBD. Large genome-wide association studies (GWAS) were able to identify 240 genetic regions associated with IBD. Many of the implicated genes have a function in the immune system, are associated with primary immunodeficiencies or the defense against mycobacteria. Together these 240 genetic regions form an excellent framework for further investigations into the pathogenesis and therapy of IBD. However, GWAS so far were able to unravel only a fraction of the genetic IBD risk. New strategies like genome wide sequencing are currently used to identify additional (rare) genetic variants. In rare cases, IBD is also inherited as a monogenetic disease. Moreover, there likely is significant interaction between genes and environmental factors which can only be unraveled if both, genes and the environment are simultaneously considered. Interestingly, the information provided by genetic risk factors for IBD is unable to predict the clinical course of IBD. New GWAS therefore focus on IBD prognosis and first insights have already been made. The gastrointestinal tract harbors a huge number of microorganisms (microbiota). It remains an enormous challenge for the immune system to contain this bacterial load while enabling the host to benefit from the many essential contributions of the microbiota. In IBD, the microbiota is altered to a dysfunctional (dysbiotic) state showing reduced diversity and a higher amount of potential pathogenic Proteobacteriae, such as Escherichia coli. In IBD, the microbiota is also more dynamic in its composition over time compared to health. Further, IBD dysbiosis is more pronounced in Crohn's disease than in ulcerative colitis. In animal experiments, dysbiosis could be transferred by fecal microbiota transplantation from one mouse to another, triggering inflammation in the recipient. In contrast, a healthy microbiota can downregulate the immune response of the host, for instance by bacterial short chain fatty acids (SCFA) synthesis. In addition, some bacteria with close physical contact to the intestinal wall also have specific immunosuppressive properties. So far, the highly complex network of microbiota, genetics, immune system and environment is only partially understood. The microbiota is a potential therapeutic target which up to now can only be non-specifically influenced by antibiotics, probiotics, prebiotics or fecal microbiota transplantation. A better understanding of the microbiota will likely yield in the discovery of new therapeutic options in the future."
30700149,"Background Seventy-five percent of βeta-thalassemic patients do not have Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) matched siblings and had until recently no access to a curative treatment Gene therapy is a promising treatment that can be proposed to these patients. This study estimates its cost and efficacy. Methods We compared in a mono-centric retrospective study and cost-efficacy analysis the two-year outcomes and costs of β-thalassemic patients treated by gene therapy and HSCT. Grade III and IV complications, hospitalizations and length of stay were extracted from the hospital discharge data. Costs were estimated from hospital accounting information and national cost studies. Results A total of seven patients with βeta-thalassemia treated between 2009 and 2016 were included and four received gene therapy. Patients treated by gene therapy were older, had fewer complications and hospital admissions. Infectious complications were three times more frequent for patients treated with HSCT than for gene therapy. Average costs were €608,086 for patients treated by gene therapy and €215,571 for HSCT. The total cost of the vector was 48% of the total cost of gene therapy. Conclusions Gene therapy as a curative alternative for patients lacking HLA matched donors was costlier but resulted in fewer complications than HSCT."
30700148,"Glucocorticoids have been commonly used in clinic due to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects and they have been proposed to be used to prevent liver toxicity when systemic administration of adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors is needed in patients with central nervous system (CNS) diseases and muscular disorders. Glucocorticoids also enable modulation of vascular permeability. In this study we first investigated the impact of dexamethasone on AAV vascular permeability after systemic injection. When a low-dose of AAV9 was injected into the mice treated with dexamethasone, the global transduction and vector bio-distribution were not significantly different in most of the tissues other than the liver and the heart when compared to the control mice. When AAV9 vectors were used at a high dose, both the transgene expression and the AAV vector genome copy number were significantly decreased in the majority of murine tissues. However, no effect on the global transduction was observed when dexamethasone was administered 2-hours after AAV vector injection. The study on the kinetics of AAV virus clearance demonstrated that dexamethasone slowed down the clearance of AAV9 in blood after systemic application. The mechanism study showed that dexamethasone inhibited the enhancement of AAV9 vascular permeability mediated by the serum proteins. The findings indicate that dexamethasone is able to inhibit the vascular permeability of AAV and compromise the therapeutic effect after systemic administration of AAV vector. In conclusion, this study provides valuable information to design future clinical studies when glucocorticoids are needed to be compatible with the systemic administration of AAV vectors in patients with CNS and muscular diseases."
30700146,"As a nucleic acid alternative to traditional antibody, aptamer holds great potential in various fields of biology and medicine such as targeted gene therapy, drug delivery, bio-sensing and laboratory medicine. Over the past decades, conventional SELEX method has undergone dramatic modifications and improvements owing to developments in material sciences and analytical techniques. However, many of the recently developed strategies either require complex materials and instruments or suffer from low efficiency and high failure rates in the selection of desired aptamers. Accordingly, the development of aptamers against new or novel targets is still a major obstacle for aptamer-based research and application. Here, we present an improved protein-SELEX procedure for simplified and highly efficient isolation of aptamers against protein targets. We describe approaches that ensure a high success rate of aptamer selection via simplifying PCR procedures, introducing denature gel, utilising an electro-elution based ssDNA separation strategy as well as an ELISA-based highly sensitive binding assay. In addition, a simplified sample preparation method for MiSeq-based next generation sequencing is also introduced. While a recombinant protein as a bait for SELEX is discussed here, this protocol will also be invaluable for researchers wishing to develop aptamers against targets other than proteins such as small molecules, lipids, carbohydrates, cells and micro-organisms for future gene therapy and/or diagnostics."
30699908,"An intriguing target involved in several pathophysiological processes is the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO), of which exact functions remained elusive until now. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the <i>TSPO</i> gene influences the binding affinity of endogenous and synthetic TSPO ligands by facilitating a lower-affinity conformation, which modifies a potential ligand binding site, ultimately leading to a binding profile classification according to each genotype. For instance, some clinical effects of the distinctive binding affinity profile of cholesterol toward the TSPO of individuals with different genotypes have been extensively discussed. Therefore, we conducted an investigation based on a radioligand binding assay, to determine the inhibition constants of some reported endogenous TSPO ligands (diazepam binding inhibitor and protoporphyrin IX), as well as synthetic ligands (disulfiram and derivatives). We observed no dependency of the polymorphism on the binding affinity of the evaluated endogenous ligands, whereas a high dependency on the binding affinity of the tested synthetic ligands was evident."
30699200,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Several miRNAs are exclusively expressed in skeletal muscle and participate in the regulation of muscle differentiation by interacting with myogenic factors. These miRNAs can be found at high levels in the serum of patients and animal models for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, which is expected to be useful as biomarkers for their clinical conditions. By miRNA microarray analysis, we identified miR-188 as a novel miRNA that is elevated in the serum of the muscular dystrophy dog model, CXMDJ. miR-188 was not muscle-specific miRNA, but its expression was up-regulated in skeletal muscles associated with muscle regeneration induced by cardiotoxin-injection in normal dogs and mice. Manipulation of miR-188 expression using antisense oligo and mimic oligo RNAs alters the mRNA expression of the myogenic regulatory factors, MRF4 and MEF2C. Our results suggest that miR-188 is a new player that participates in the gene regulation process of muscle differentiation and that it may serve as a serum biomarker reflecting skeletal muscle regeneration."
30699061,This study investigated the efficiency and potential toxicity of a linear 22-kDa polyethylenimine (PEI)-DNA nanoconstruct for delivering genes to corneal cells and the effects of PEI nitrogen-to-DNA phosphate (N:P) ratio on gene transfer efficiency in vitro and in vivo.
30698716,"An individual's lipid profile is influenced by genetic variants and alcohol consumption, but the contribution of interactions between these exposures has not been studied. We therefore incorporated gene-alcohol interactions into a multi-ancestry genome-wide association study of levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides. We included 45 studies in Stage 1 (genome-wide discovery) and 66 studies in Stage 2 (focused follow-up), for a total of 394,584 individuals from five ancestry groups. Genetic main and interaction effects were jointly assessed by a 2 degrees of freedom (DF) test, and a 1 DF test was used to assess the interaction effects alone. Variants at 495 loci were at least suggestively associated (P < 1 × 10-6) with lipid levels in Stage 1 and were evaluated in Stage 2, followed by combined analyses of Stage 1 and Stage 2. In the combined analysis of Stage 1 and Stage 2, 147 independent loci were associated with lipid levels at P < 5 × 10-8 using 2 DF tests, of which 18 were novel. No genome-wide significant associations were found testing the interaction effect alone. The novel loci included several genes (PCSK5, VEGFB, and A1CF) with a putative role in lipid metabolism based on existing evidence from cellular and experimental models."
30698354,"Takayasu arteritis (TA), despite being classified as a large vessel vasculitis, has distinct genetic, pathological and clinical features as compared to giant cell arteritis. It is a rare disease seen more commonly in Asian countries. The challenge lies in assessing the degree of inflammation in a narrowed vessel and immunosuppressive therapy improves inflammatory features but is unable to open up an occluded vessel. It may have a positive effect on retarding further occlusion. Like antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis, TA needs a collaborative effort to do randomized controlled therapy to provide benefit to patients."
30698159,"Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is a primary immunodeficiency disease in which a number of underlying gene defects are responsible for abnormalities in neutrophil development. The HCLS1-associated protein X1 (HAX1) mutation is associated with an autosomal-recessive form of SCN. Considering the potential of gene therapy approaches for the treatment of monogenic disorders, in this study we aimed to develop retroviral vectors expressing coding sequences (CDS) to be used for the removal of the genetic blockade in deficient hematopoietic cells. Following amplification of CDS with primers containing appropriate restriction sites, HAX1 CDS was cloned into an intermediate vector using TA-cloning. The sequence was transferred into a retroviral vector, followed by retroviral packaging in Plat-A cells. To show HAX1 protein expression, HEK293T cells were exposed to 10 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of retroviral particles and HAX1 expression was confirmed in these cells, using indirect intracellular flow cytometry. This vector was applied for in vitro transduction of hematopoietic stem cell with HAX1 mutation; after 11 days, cultured cells were analyzed for CD66acde and CD177 (neutrophil surface markers) and the expression was compared to that in the control groups. Increased neutrophil production in HAX1 viral vector-expressing hematopoietic cells was observed as compared to control vector transduced cells. Hence, according to the results, this type of therapy could be considered a potential treatment protocol for the disease."
30698091,"High-investment medications, such as gene therapy and innovative specialty medications, offer breakthrough treatments that can greatly improve outcomes to patients with serious health conditions. However, many of these therapies are associated with significant costs that create barriers to patient access and affordability. Such innovative treatments have higher short-term costs, compared with current standards of care, but are anticipated to deliver substantial benefits that may persist over a long period of time, such as reduced mortality, improved health and quality of life, reduced health care costs, improved productivity, and reduced disability. The effect of these changes on patterns of treatment costs can vary significantly over time across payers. For example, the initial payer who covers a one-time treatment invests more resources than a payer that covers a cured enrollee later in life. Thus, high-investment medications raise questions about how costs are managed and distributed across systems and payers, including patients. As more high-investment medications are approved, some stakeholders are concerned that the current system for managing these medications will become unsustainable. It is clear that innovative and novel strategies are needed to support patient access to these new treatments, while addressing concerns about sustainability of the health care system in the United States. To explore new benefit designs and payment models for high-investment medications, the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy convened a stakeholder forum on July 24-25, 2018. Health care leaders representing academia, health plans, integrated delivery systems, pharmacy benefit managers, employers, national professional associations, the federal government, and biopharmaceutical companies participated in the forum. During the forum, participants engaged in thoughtful discussions regarding challenges and opportunities associated with innovative strategies for providing coverage for high-investment medications. The goals of the forum were as follows: (a) gain insights based on participants' unique perspectives on how the managed care ecosystem views high-investment medications for chronic versus curative diseases; (b) develop new solutions for benefit designs and overall value assessment for high-investment medications; (c) identify nontraditional contracting methods and reimbursement models to address high-investment medication challenges; (d) learn how to work with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and state Medicaid officials to garner support and coverage of these medications; (e) determine whether any legal or regulatory barriers exist for new types of benefit designs and look for opportunities to address those barriers; and (f) develop best case solutions of high-investment medications in order to overcome potential challenges and achieve sustainable appropriate use. DISCLOSURES: The AMCP Partnership Forum and the development of the proceedings document were supported by Abbvie, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Celgene, Gilead, the National Pharmaceutical Council, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Takeda, and Xcenda/AmerisourceBergen."
30697976,"Platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta (PDGFRB) rearrangement has been reported in a number of patients with chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL), B-acute lymphoblastic leukemia, myeloproliferative neoplasms, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Here, we report a case of CEL carrying a novel fusion gene involving PDGFRB and GRIP and coiled-coil domain containing 2 (GCC2)."
30697821,"Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a rare chronic inflammatory dermatosis with multifactorial etiology. It is known that particular caspase recruitment domain family member 14 (CARD14) gene mutations are associated with familial PRP and certain forms of psoriasis. Additionally, few data are available about the role of CARD14 genvariants in sporadic PRP. The clinical picture is variable for the different types of PRP, therefore choosing the adequate treatment is often difficult, furthermore there are no specific guidelines for therapy."
30697727,"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) is an RNA-guided gene editing tool which offers several advantageous characteristics in comparison with the conventional methods (e.g., zinc finger nucleases and transcription activator-like effector nucleases) such as cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and being easy-to-use. Despite some limitations such as efficient delivery and safety, CRISPR-Cas9 is still the most convenient tool for gene editing purposes. Due to the potential capability of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in genome editing and correction of casual mutations, it can be considered as a possible therapeutic system in the treatment of disorders associated with the genome mutations and in particular cancer treatment. In this review, we will discuss CRISPR-Cas-based gene editing along with its classifications and mechanism of action. Furthermore, the therapeutic application of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in mutational disorders, delivery systems, as well as its advantages and limitations with a special emphasis on cancer treatment will be discussed."
30697722,"Cutaneous squamous-cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the second most common skin cancer, with an increasing incidence in recent years. To define the molecular basis that drive cSCC development and progression, this study aimed at identifying potential novel molecular targets for the diagnosis and therapy of patients with cSCC. Two data sets with the accession number GSE45164 and GSE66359 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. After the identification of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from these two data sets, respectively, between cSCC samples and controls, a combination of DEGs from these two data sets were subjected to the following analyses, including functional annotation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and module construction, transcription factor (TF)-target regulation prediction, and drug-gene interaction predictive analysis. A total of 204 upregulated genes and 213 downregulated genes were found in two data sets which were used for the follow-up analysis. Upregulated and downregulated genes were mainly involved in the functions such as cell division, mitotic nuclear division, cell cycle, and p53 signaling pathway. Interferon induced protein family members and proteasome subunit members were involved in the TF-target regulatory network, such as PSMB8, CXCL10, and IFIT3. Eight upregulated genes ( TOP2A, CXCL8, RRM2, PSMB8, PSMB9, PBK, CXCL10, and ISG15) that were hub genes in the PPI network and significant modules were identified in the predicted drug-gene interaction. In conclusion, TOP2A, CXCL8, RRM2, PSMB8, PSMB9, PBK, CXCL10, and ISG15 may be potential targets for the diagnosis and therapy of patients with cSCC."
30697531,"Breast cancer is one of the major causes of cancer related mortality in women worldwide. Limitations of conventional anti-cancer therapies such as severe systemic side effects, narrow therapeutic index, non-specificity, and non-availability of drugs for all types of cancers has resulted in the development of various novel and targeted approaches. The use of viruses as oncolytic agents has gained momentum for the development of an efficient therapeutic platform. In this study, we have developed recombinant measles virus armed with BNiP3, a pro-apoptotic gene of human origin, as an oncolytic agent, and have demonstrated its ability to induce apoptosis in breast cancer cells <i>in vitro</i>. Studies have demonstrated the potential of using oncolytic viruses in combination with conventional therapies as an efficient anti-cancer regimen. We also have explored the synergistic potential of this virus in combination with paclitaxel, and a hydrazone derivative, H2 compound as an anti-cancer agent. MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231, human breast cancer cell lines were used for <i>in vitro</i> studies to evaluate toxic effects of armed virus, rMV-BNiP3 both as a standalone therapy and in combination with paclitaxel or H2 compound, a hydrazone derivative. Generation of armed virus was confirmed by detecting the viral transcript and protein expression, while its oncolytic potential by cell viability assays. Induction of apoptosis was demonstrated by fluorescence based caspase 3 activity and flow cytometry based Annexin V/PI staining. In the current study we have demonstrated the successful generation of an oncolytic measles virus armed with BNiP3 (rMV-BNiP3) and the induction of toxic effects in rMV-BNiP3 infected cells with a curious bias toward MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to MCF-7. Infection of breast cancer cells with rMV-BNiP3 caused induction of cell death, but the combination of rMV-BNiP3 with sub-lethal doses of both paclitaxel and H2 lowered the overall viability of cancer cells. As triple negative breast tumors are highly aggressive and resistant subtype of breast cancer with poor prognosis, comparative sensitivity of MDA-MB-231 cells toward this virus may potentially be used to develop a targeted therapy against triple negative breast cancer."
30697529,"Measurable residual disease (MRD) testing after initial chemotherapy treatment can predict relapse and survival in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, it has not been established if repeat molecular or genetic testing during chemotherapy can offer information regarding the chemotherapy sensitivity of the leukemic clone. Blood from 45 adult AML patients at day 1 and 4 of induction (<i>n</i> = 35) or salvage (<i>n</i> = 10) cytotoxic chemotherapy was collected for both quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assessment (<i>WT1</i>) and next generation sequencing (>500 × depth) of 49 gene regions recurrently mutated in MDS/AML. The median age of subjects was 62 (23-78); 42% achieved a complete response. <i>WT1</i> was overexpressed in most patients tested but was uninformative for very early MRD assessment. A median of 4 non-synonymous variants (range 0-7) were detected by DNA sequencing of blood on day 1 of therapy [median variant allele frequency (VAF): 29%]. Only two patients had no variants detectable. All mutations remained detectable in blood on day 4 of intensive chemotherapy and remarkably the ratio of mutated to wild-type sequence was often maintained. This phenomenon was not limited to variants in <i>DNMT3A, TET2</i>, and <i>ASXL1</i>. The kinetics of <i>NPM1</i> and <i>TP53</i> variant burden early during chemotherapy appeared to be exceptions and exhibited consistent trends in this cohort. In summary, molecular testing of blood on day 4 of chemotherapy is not predictive of clinical response to cytotoxic induction therapy in AML. The observed stability in variant allele frequency suggests that cytotoxic therapy may have a limited therapeutic index for clones circulating in blood containing these mutations. Further validation is required to confirm the utility of monitoring <i>NPM1</i> and <i>TP53</i> kinetics in blood during cytotoxic therapy."
30697448,"Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common pediatric cancer and also occurs in adults. Although the outcomes of multi-agent chemotherapy regimens have greatly improved, high toxicity and relapses in many patients necessitate the development of novel therapeutic approaches. Advances in molecular profiling and cytogenetics have identified a broad range of genetic abnormalities, including gene mutations, chromosome translocations and aneuploidy, which has provided a more comprehensive understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of ALL. This understanding has also led to new targeted therapeutic approaches, including the use of selective small molecule inhibitors, nucleic acid-based therapies and immune-based therapies mediated by specific monoclonal antibodies and cellular immunotherapy, which are poised to revolutionize the treatment of various ALL subtypes. The main focus of this review is to highlight the latest advances in ALL biology, including the identification of prognostic factors and putative therapeutic targets. We also review the current status of, and ongoing progress in, the development of targeted therapies for ALL."
30697355,"All studies to date involving platelet reactivity and gene testing document singular interventions and their associations with outcomes. The East Asian paradox has been well documented - Asians who have had a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are at a lower risk of ischaemic events even though they have a higher platelet reactivity. Asians who have had a PCI also have a higher risk of bleeding. This article covers the differences in outcomes between Caucasians and Asians, and explores the impact of outcomes, highlighting differences between the two patient populations. Given the high prevalence of loss-of-function alleles in Asia, treatment strategies will differ for different populations. It is plausible that both platelet reactivity and gene testing should be used to inform holistic decision-making for all patients - Caucasian or Asian - with acute coronary syndrome who are undergoing PCI."
30697282,<i>Pneumocystis</i> pneumonia (PCP) is responsible for pulmonary infection in immunocompromised patients. The current study aimed at investigating the frequency of <i>Pneumocystis</i> colonization in patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) and evaluating the relationship between PCP and <i>Pneumocystis</i> colonization.
30697138,"With the initiatives by the National Institutes of Health and the US Food and Drug Administration, pharmacogenomics is transitioning from the laboratory to patient care. Nearly 200 drug products now contain pharmacogenomic information as part of their labeling; many of these products are commonly used in the pediatric population. Because pharmacogenomic testing can provide patient-specific predictors for drug response, pharmacists are positioned to assume a leadership role in pharmacogenomic testing, clinical interpretation of results, and recommendations for individualization of drug therapy. Opportunities for pharmacists exist in both inpatient and outpatient settings, such as pharmacist-managed clinical pharmacogenomics consultation services and educating patients and families about pharmacogenomic testing. Given the potential for genetic and age-dependent factors to influence drug selection and dosing, pediatric pharmacists should be involved in the development of dosing recommendations and interprofessional practice guidelines regarding pharmacogenomic testing in pediatric patients. Opportunities to become knowledgeable and competent in pharmacogenomics extend from coursework as part of the pharmacy curriculum to postgraduate education (e.g., residencies, fellowship, continuing education). The Pediatric Pharmacy Advocacy Group acknowledges a need for increased education of both students and practicing pharmacists with consideration for infants and children."
30697061,"Advancements in molecular and genetic techniques have significantly furthered our biological understanding of Ewing sarcoma (ES). ES is typified by a driving TET-ETS fusion with an otherwise relatively quiet genome. Detection of one of several characteristic fusions, most commonly <i>EWSR1-FLI1</i>, is the gold standard for diagnosis. We discuss the current role of precision medicine in the diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of ES. Continued efforts toward molecularly guided approaches are actively being pursued in ES to better refine prognosis, identify germline markers of disease susceptibility, influence therapeutic selection, effectively monitor disease activity in real time, and identify genetic and immunotherapeutic targets for therapeutic development."
30696954,"Cancer is caused by a series of alterations in genome and epigenome and exists in multiple complex forms, making it difficult to be prevented and/or treated. Telomerase, an enzyme responsible for the maintenance of telomere, is silent in most normal somatic cells but activated in 90% of cancer cells, making it an excellent target for cancer therapy. Therefore, various telomerase activity inhibitors have been developed to treat cancer but all failed due to side effects. Here we acted oppositely to develop a cancer gene therapy named telomerase-activating gene expression (Tage) system by utilizing the telomerase activity in cancer cells. The Tage system consisted of an effector gene expression vector that carried a 3' telomerase-recognizable stick end and an artificial transcription factor expression vector that could express dCas9-VP64 and an sgRNA targeting telomere repeat sequences. By using Cas9 as an effector gene, the Tage system effectively killed various cancer cells, including HepG2, HeLa, PANC-1, MDA-MB-453, A549, HT-29, SKOV-3, Hepa1-6, and RAW264.7, without affecting normal cells MRC-5, HL7702, and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cell (BMSC). More importantly, a four-base 3' stick end produced by the homothallic switching endonuclease in cells could be recognized by telomerase, allowing the Tage system to effectively kill cancer cells in vivo. The Tage system could effectively and safely realize its in vivo application by using adeno-associated virus (AAV) as gene vector. The virus-loaded Tage system could significantly and specifically kill cancer cells in mice by intravenous drug administration without side effects or toxicity."
30696889,"The derivation of kidney tissues from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) and its application for replacement therapy in end-stage renal disease have been widely discussed. Here we report that consecutive transfections of two sets of synthetic mRNAs encoding transcription factors can induce rapid and efficient differentiation of hPSCs into kidney tissues, termed induced nephron-like organoids (iNephLOs). The first set - FIGLA, PITX2, ASCL1 and TFAP2C, differentiated hPSCs into SIX2<sup>+</sup>SALL1<sup>+</sup> nephron progenitor cells with 92% efficiency within 2 days. Subsequently, the second set - HNF1A, GATA3, GATA1 and EMX2, differentiated these cells into PAX8<sup>+</sup>LHX1<sup>+</sup> pretubular aggregates in another 2 days. Further culture in both 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional conditions produced iNephLOs containing cells characterized as podocytes, proximal tubules, and distal tubules in an additional 10 days. Global gene expression profiles showed similarities between iNephLOs and the human adult kidney, suggesting possible uses of iNephLOs as in vitro models for kidneys."
30696708,"Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with increased risk of metabolic disorders in offspring in later life. Although mounting evidence suggests that therapy for GDM could improve neonatal health, it is not known whether the therapy confers long-term metabolic benefits to offspring in their later adult lives. Here, using a mouse model of diabetes in the latter half of pregnancy to mimic human GDM, we find that the efficient insulin therapy of GDM confers significant protection against glucose intolerance and obesity in offspring fed on normal chow diet. However, the therapy fails to protect offspring when challenged with a high fat diet, especially for male offspring. Genome-wide DNA methylation profiling of pancreatic islets from male offspring identified hypermethylated regions in several genes that regulate insulin secretion, including <i>Abcc8</i>, <i>Cav1.2</i> and <i>Cav2.3</i> that encode K<sub>ATP</sub> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, which is associated with reduced gene expression and impaired insulin secretion. This finding suggests a methylation-mediated epigenetic mechanism for GDM-induced intergenerational glucose intolerance. It highlights that even efficient insulin therapy of GDM is insufficient to fully protect adult offspring from diet-induced metabolic disorders."
30696452,"Between 1 and 5% of children in industrialized countries are conceived through Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART). As infertility and the use of ART may be associated with adverse perinatal outcomes, care plans specific to these pregnancies are needed. We conducted a systematic review to examine the existing care plans specific to women pregnant following Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART)."
30696428,"Protein-based Cas9 in vivo gene editing therapeutics have practical limitations owing to their instability and low efficacy. To overcome these obstacles and improve stability, we designed a nanocarrier primarily consisting of lecithin that can efficiently target liver disease and encapsulate complexes of Cas9 with a single-stranded guide RNA (sgRNA) ribonucleoprotein (Cas9-RNP) through polymer fusion self-assembly."
30696380,"DNA methylation status is closely associated with diverse diseases, and is generally more stable than gene expression, thus abnormal DNA methylation could be important biomarkers for tumor diagnosis, treatment and prognosis. However, the signatures regarding DNA methylation changes for pan-cancer diagnosis and prognosis are less explored. Here we systematically analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation patterns in diverse TCGA cancers with machine learning. We identified seven CpG sites that could effectively discriminate tumor samples from adjacent normal tissue samples for 12 main cancers of TCGA (1216 samples, AUC > 0.99). Those seven potential diagnostic biomarkers were further validated in the other 9 different TCGA cancers and 4 independent datasets (AUC > 0.92). Three out of the seven CpG sites were correlated with cell division, DNA replication and cell cycle. We also identified 12 CpG sites that can effectively distinguish 26 different cancers (7605 samples), and the result was repeatable in independent datasets as well as two disparate tumors with metastases (micro-average AUC > 0.89). Furthermore, a series of potential signatures that could significantly predict the prognosis of tumor patients for 7 different cancer were identified via survival analysis (p-value < 1e-4). Collectively, DNA methylation patterns vary greatly between tumor and adjacent normal tissues, as well as among different types of cancers. Our identified signatures may aid the decision of clinical diagnosis and prognosis for pan-cancer and the potential cancer-specific biomarkers could be used to predict the primary site of metastatic breast and prostate cancers."
30696106,"The transplantation of retinal cells has been studied in animals to establish proof of its potential benefit for the treatment of blinding diseases. Photoreceptor precursors have been grafted in animal models of Mendelian-inherited retinal degenerations, and retinal pigmented epithelial cells have been used to restore visual function in animal models of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and recently in patients. Cell therapy over corrective gene therapy in inherited retinal degeneration can overcome the genetic heterogeneity by providing one treatment for all genetic forms of the diseases. In AMD, the existence of multiple risk alleles precludes a priori the use of corrective gene therapy. Mechanistically, the experiments of photoreceptor precursor transplantation reveal the importance of cytoplasmic material exchange between the grafted cells and the host cells for functional rescue, an unsuspected mechanism and novel concept. For transplantation of retinal pigmented epithelial cells, the mechanisms behind the therapeutic benefit are only partially understood, and clinical trials are ongoing. The fascinating studies that describe the development of methodologies to produce cells to be grafted and demonstrate the functional benefit for vision are reviewed."
30696104,"Genetic testing for <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> genes has led to the identification of many unique variants of uncertain significance (VUS). Multifactorial likelihood models that predict the odds ratio for VUS in favor or against cancer causality, have been developed, but their use is conditioned by the amount of necessary data, which are difficult to obtain if a variant is rare. As an alternative, variants mapping to the coding regions can be examined using in vitro functional assays. BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins promote genome protection by interacting with different proteins. In this study, we assessed the functional effect of two sets of variants in <i>BRCA</i> genes by exploiting the green fluorescent protein (GFP)-reassembly in vitro assay, which was set-up to test the BRCA1/BARD1, BRCA1/UbcH5a, and BRCA2/DSS1 interactions. Based on the findings observed for the validation panels of previously classified variants, BRCA1/UbcH5a and BRCA2/DSS1 binding assays showed 100% sensitivity and specificity in identifying pathogenic and non-pathogenic variants. While the actual efficiency of these assays in assessing the clinical significance of BRCA VUS has to be verified using larger validation panels, our results suggest that the GFP-reassembly assay is a robust method to identify variants affecting normal protein functioning and contributes to the classification of VUS."
30696094,"In vivo imaging of biological processes is an important asset of modern cell biology. Selectively reacting fluorophores herein are an important tool and click chemistry reactions take a large share in these events. 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) is well known for visualizing DNA replication, but does not show any selectivity for incorporation into DNA. Striving for specific visualization of virus replication, in particular HIV replication, a series of propargylated purine deoxynucleosides were prepared aiming for selective incorporation by HIV reverse transcriptase (RT). We here report on the synthesis and preliminary biological effects (cellular toxicity, HIV inhibitory effects, and feasibility of the click reaction) of these nucleoside analogues."
30696033,"Suitable carriers are crucial to RNAi applications for cancer genotherapy and T-cell immunotherapy. In this research, we selected two extensively-investigated biocompatible inorganic nanoparticle carriers, i.e., layered double hydroxide (LDH) and lipid-coated calcium phosphate (LCP) and then compared their efficacy for siRNA delivery in T cells, in order to understand which carrier is more efficient in delivering functional programmed cell death protein 1 siRNA (PD-1 siRNA) to suspended T lymphocytes. Both LDH and LCP nanoparticles quickly delivered gene segment to mouse T cell lines (EL4), while the LCP nanoparticles exhibited more cellular uptake and higher PD-1 gene silence efficiency. We further demonstrated that LCP nanoparticles successfully reduced the expression of PD-1 in human ex vivo tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Thus, LCP nanoparticles can be used as a better nano-carrier for gene therapy in lymphocytes, especially in regards to TIL-related cancer immunotherapy."
30695890,"<b>Objective:</b> To summarize the clinical manifestations and gene variations of combined immunodeficiency caused by ORAI1 variation with a case report and literature review. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of the patient who was diagnosed with ORAI1 variation caused combined immunodeficiency in the Department of Pediatrics in Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in February 2018 were extracted and analyzed. The literature till August 2018 was searched with key words of 'ORAI1', and 'immunodeficiency' in both English and Chinese in the database of China national knowledge infrast ructure (CNKI), Wanfang and Pubmed. <b>Results:</b> The patient was a 15 months old girl with acute onset of bilateral ptosis after upper respiratory tract infection, which was rapidly progressed to systemic myasthenia and accompanied with recurrent respiratory tract infection during the treatment. The patient poorly to responded immunomodulatory therapy and anti-infection therapy. Laboratory tests demonstrated decreased complement C3 and NK cell (CD3(-)CD56(+)), increased anti-thyroglobulin, thyroid peroxidase antibody and B lymphocyte (CD3(-)CD19(+)), and slightly increased anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody. Genetic analysis showed the homozygous variation of ORAI1 gene exon l c.12 G>T (p.E4D), with heterozygostty of both parents. There were only 4 papers reporting this disease in the literature review. A total of 7 patients with ORAI1 gene variation were reported, including 3 homozygous variations, 2 heterozygous variations and 2 complex heterozygous variations. The clinical manifestations included early onset recurrent infection, congenital hypotonia, elevated serum IgA and IgM, decreased NK cells, and family history of hereditary diseases. Four of the 7 reported cases died of pulmonary infection and sepsis, and the other 3 survived with low muscular tone and poor self-care ability. <b>Conclusions:</b> The most common clinical manifestations of ORAI1 variation caused combined immunodeficiency are recurrent infection and congenital hypotonia. Myasthenia induced recurrent respiratory tract infection is an important factor of poor prognosis in severe patients. There is a lack of effective treatment for this disease, and the prognosis is poor."
30695102,"Using cell-associated DNA and cell-free RNA of HIV-1, we investigated the role of drug-resistant viral variants that emerged during early antiretroviral therapy (ART) in determining virological outcome. This case-control study compared virologic non-responder children (two viral loads ≥200 copies/ml within two years of ART) and responder children (two VLs <200 copies/ml after six months of ART) infected with HIV-1 initiated on non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART. The partial reverse transcriptase gene of HIV-1 in cell-associated DNA was genotyped using next-generation sequencing (NGS; Illumina; threshold 0.5%; at baseline and month six of ART) and in cell-free RNA (concurrently and at virological failure; VL >1000 copies/ml at ≥12 months of ART) using the Sanger method. Among 30 non-responders and 37 responders, baseline differences were insignificant while adherence, viral load and drug resistance mutations (DRMs) observed at month six differed significantly (p=>0.05). At month six, NGS estimated a higher number of DRMs compared to Sanger (50% vs. 33%; p=0.001). Among the non-responders carrying a resistant virus (86.6%) at virological failure, 26% harboured clinically-relevant low-frequency DRMs in the cell-associated DNA at month six (0.5 to 20%; K103N, G190A, Y181C, and M184I). Plasma VL of >3 log<sub>10</sub> copies/ml (AOR=30.4, 95%CI=3.3-281, p=0.003) and treatment-relevant DRMs detected in the cell-associated DNA at month six (AOR=24.2, 95%CI=2.6-221, p=0.005) were independently associated with increased risk for early virological failure. Our findings suggest that treatment-relevant DRMs acquired in cell-associated DNA during the first six months of ART can predict virological failure in children initiated on NNRTI-based ART.

30694827,"In this review, we intend to show the heterogenicity of the triglyceride group, including the triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and its subparticles, apolipoproteins, and its role in atherogenesis through epidemiological and genetic studies, observing the association of these various components and subclasses with subclinical atherosclerosis and cardiovascular events. Also, we reevaluated the moment of blood collection for the triglyceride measurement and its repercussion in atherosclerosis. Finally, we present the current scenario and new insights about the pharmacologic treatment of hypertriglyceridemia."
30694508,"The analysis of the lung microbiome composition is a field of research that recently emerged. It gained great interest in pulmonary diseases such as pneumonia since the microbiome seems to be involved in host immune responses, inflammation, and protection against pathogens. Thus, it is possible that the microbial communities living in the lungs play a role in the outcome and severity of lung infections such as Legionella-caused pneumonia and in the response to antibiotic therapy. In this chapter, all steps necessary for the characterization of the bacterial and fungal fraction of the lung microbiome using high-throughput sequencing approaches are explained, starting from the selection of clinical samples to the analysis of the taxonomic composition, diversity, and ecology of the microbiome."
30694219,"Across clinical trials, T cell expansion and persistence following adoptive cell transfer (ACT) have correlated with superior patient outcomes. Herein, we undertook a pan-cancer analysis to identify actionable ligand/receptor pairs capable of compromising T cell durability following ACT. We discovered that FASLG, the gene encoding the apoptosis-inducing ligand FasL, is overexpressed within the majority of human tumor microenvironments (TMEs). Further, we uncovered that Fas, the receptor for FasL, is highly expressed on patient-derived T cells used for clinical ACT. We hypothesized that a cognate Fas-FasL interaction within the TME might limit both T cell persistence and anti-tumor efficacy. We discovered that genetic engineering of Fas variants impaired in the ability to bind FADD functioned as dominant negative receptors (DNRs), preventing FasL-induced apoptosis in Fas-competent T cells. T cells co-engineered with a Fas DNR and either a T cell receptor or chimeric antigen receptor exhibited enhanced persistence following ACT, resulting in superior anti-tumor efficacy against established solid and hematologic cancers. Despite increased longevity, Fas DNR-engineered T cells did not undergo aberrant expansion or mediate autoimmunity. Thus, T cell-intrinsic disruption of Fas signaling through genetic engineering represents a potentially universal strategy to enhance ACT efficacy across a broad range of human malignancies."
30694012,"While family communication about a BRCA1 or BRCA2 (BRCA1/2) pathogenic variant can be a catalyst for the uptake of risk-reducing measures in young adults, disseminating information within families and across generations is complex. This study aimed to explore how young adults and their families communicate about a BRCA1/2 pathogenic variant, from a family systems perspective. In-depth family interviews and questionnaires (N = 67 individuals; 21 families) were completed at four metropolitan and regional genetic clinics in Australia. Data involved thematic analysis and interpretation based on family systems theory, including the use of standardized measures. Six key themes were identified and explored: (1) Responsibility to protect, (2) ""It's a woman's problem,"" (3) Family culture influences communication, (4) Adversarial growth and connection, (5) Key events can be relational turning points, and (6) Health professionals can help. Family identities were solidified through the incorporation of a pathogenic variant in family scripts, while members of the family who held differing views to their families expressed less agreeableness and openness to disseminate information. The collective family's experience and perspective toward a pathogenic variant can influence a young adult's decision-making about genetic testing, risk-management, and family planning. The utilization of family therapy skills in routine practice would be helpful in facilitating communication and the inclusion of standardized measures is beneficial to identify individuals needing ongoing psychological support. Understanding relationship difficulties that arise from family members holding divergent views can offer insight into future research inquiry and areas of further training and clinical support."
30693983,"Follicular lymphoma (FL) is the most common indolent B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with genetic alterations of BCL-2, KMT2B, and KMT6. FL is refractory to conventional chemotherapy and is still incurable in most patients. Thus, new drugs and/or novel combination treatment strategies are needed to further improve FL patient outcome. We investigated the efficacy of the histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) inhibitor A452 combined with a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib on NHL and the underlying mechanisms compared with the current clinically tested HDAC6 inhibitor ACY-1215. We first showed that FL is the most sensitive to HDAC6 inhibitor. We showed that combining A452 with ibrutinib led to the synergistic inhibition of cell growth and decreased viability of FL cells, as well as increased levels of apoptosis. Similar synergistic interactions occur in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and germinal center diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cells (DLBCL). Enhanced cell death is associated with AKT and ERK1/2 inactivation and increased DNA damage (induction of γH2A.X and reduction of pChk1/2). In addition, A452 downregulates c-Myc, an effect significantly enhanced by ibruninib. Although ACY-1215 is less potent than A452, it displays synergism with ibrutinib. Overall, our results suggest that A452 is more effective as an anticancer agent than ACY-1215 in FL. These findings suggest that a combination of HDAC6-selective inhibitor and ibrutinib is a potent therapeutic strategy for NHL including FL. This article is protected by copyright.

30693797,"Wilson disease (WD), an autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in a copper-transporting P-type ATPase (Atp7b), causes severe liver damage. This disease is currently treated with the lifelong use of copper chelation therapy, which has side effects and does not fix copper metabolism. Here, we thoroughly characterized a mouse model of WD, the toxic milk (txJ) mouse, and used the model to test a gene therapy approach for treating WD. WD mice accumulated copper in the liver from birth; severe copper accumulation and concurrent liver disease were evident by two months of age. Intravenously administering an adeno-associated viral (AAV) 8 vector expressing a codon-optimized version of the human ATP7B transgene into two-month-old WD mice significantly decreased liver copper levels compared to age-matched, un-injected, WD mice. We also observed a significant dose-dependent decrease in liver disease. Male mice injected with 1011 genome copies of AAV8 vector showed only mild histopathological findings with a complete lack of liver fibrosis. Therefore, we conclude that administering gene therapy at the early stages of disease onset is a promising approach for reducing liver damage and correcting copper metabolism in WD."
30693792,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors currently represent the most attractive platform for viral gene therapy and are also valuable research tools to study gene function or establish disease models. Consequently, many academic labs, core facilities and biotech/pharma companies meanwhile produce AAVs for research and early clinical development. Whereas fast, universal protocols for vector purification (downstream processing) are available, AAV production using adherent HEK-293 cells still requires time-consuming passaging and extensive culture expansion before transfection. Moreover, most scalable culture platforms require special equipment or extensive method development. To tackle these limitations in upstream processing, we evaluated frozen high-density cell stocks as a ready-to-seed source of producer cells, and further investigated the multilayered CELLdisc culture system for upscaling. Our results demonstrate equal AAV productivity using frozen cell stock-derived cultures as compared to conventionally cultured cells as well as scalability using CELLdiscs. Thus, by directly seeding freshly thawed cells into CELLdiscs, AAV production can be easily upscaled and efficiently standardized to low-passage, high-viability cells in a timely flexible manner, potentially dismissing time-consuming routine cell culture work. In conjunction with a further optimized iodixanol protocol, this process enabled supplying a large animal study with two high-yield AAV2 capsid variant batches (0.6-1.2x10<sup>15</sup> VG) in as little as four weeks."
30693698,"Promyelocytic leukemia (PML) protein, a tumor suppressor, plays an important role in patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) receiving arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) therapy. APL is a M3 subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is characterized by expression of PML-RARα (P/R) fusion protein, leading to the oncogenesis. As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> is currently used as the first-line drug for patients with APL, and the mechanism may be:As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> directly binds to PML part of P/R protein and induces multimerization of related proteins, which further recruits different functional proteins to reform PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), and finally it degraded by SUMOylation and ubiquitination proteasomal pathway. Gene mutations may lead to relapse and drug resistance after As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> treatment. In this review, we discuss the structure and function of PML proteins; the pathogenesis of APL induced by P/R fusion protein; the involvement of PML protein in treatment of APL patient with As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>; and explain how PML protein mutations could cause resistance to As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> therapy."
30693619,"Despite decades of efforts, gene therapy (GT) has failed delivering a clinically significant anti-cancer treatment due, in part, to low selectivity, efficiency and poor accessibility of folded RNA targets. Here, we propose to solve these common problems of GT agents using DNA nanotechnology approach. We designed a deoxyribozyme-based DNA machine that can (i) recognize a sequence of a cancer biomarker with high selectivity, (ii) tightly bind structured fragment of a housekeeping gene mRNA, and (iii) cleave it with efficiency greater than that of a traditional DZ-based cleaving agent. The deoxyribozyme DNA machine can potentially become a prototype platform for a new type of anti-cancer GT agents."
30693535,"Galactosialidosis (GS; OMIM #256540) is a rare multisystemic inborn glycoprotein storage disease caused by biallelic mutations in the cathepsin A gene resulting in combined deficiency of the lysosomal enzymes β-galactosidase and α-neuraminidase. The precise understanding of the natural course of the disease is limited. Development of enzyme replacement therapy is at the preclinical stage. The purpose of this research project was to quantitatively characterize the natural history of the condition. Quantitative analysis of all published cases in the literature with sufficient data (N = 142 patients) was carried out. Main outcome variables were survival, diagnostic delay, description of symptoms, biomarker-phenotype associations, and radiological findings. STROBE criteria were respected. Median survival age of the cohort was 48 years. Median age of onset was 4.25 years with interquartile range (IQR) 1 to 16 years. Median age at diagnosis was 19 (IQR: 8.92-29) years, with median diagnostic delay of 8 (IQR: 4-12) years. Patients with residual β-galactosidase activity of more than 8.6% (leukocytes) survived significantly longer than patients with lower enzyme activities."
30693508,"Wnt is a major signaling pathway involved in multifaceted roles of various biological processes. Bones are dynamic tissues which are able to remodel and maintain the tissue homeostasis. Wnt signaling cascade leads to the promotion of bone formation and suppression of bone resorption, leading to a balance in bone remodeling. Recent evidence has reinforced the inevitable role of Wnt signaling in osteoporosis. The complex genetic and epigenetic regulations of Wnt signaling factors and their interaction with other master signaling pathways such as TGF-β, BMP, PI3K/AKT, and Hedgehog outline their importance in diagnosis and treatment of osteoporosis. In this review, we highlighted the recent advances in function of Wnt signaling-related epigenetic regulation, different signaling pathways interacting with Wnt, and their roles in osteoporosis. Finally, we discussed novel promises in molecular targeted therapy of osteoporosis."
30693458,"Black and brown-colored mucocutaneous lesions present a differential diagnostic challenge, with malignant melanoma being the primary clinical concern. The vast majority of pigmented lesions in the head and neck region are the result of benign, reactive factors such as post-inflammatory melanosis. However, it is not uncommon to discover a range of muco-cutaneous black and brown neoplasms in the oro-facial area. The majority of black/brown pigmented neoplasms are melanocytic in origin; these are neoplasms of neural crest derivation. Melanocytic nevi are a diverse group of benign neoplasms that are the result of specific oncogenic mutations. They are common on cutaneous surfaces but can manifest in mucosal sites. Currently, nevi are classified based on clinical and histological criteria. The most common cutaneous and oral mucosal nevus is the acquired melanocytic nevus; nevi do not pose an increased risk for the development of malignant melanoma. Emerging information on specific genetic differences supports the notion of biologically distinct nevi. This article will review the classic clinical and microscopic features of nevi commonly found in the head and neck region, and discuss emerging concepts in nevus pathogenesis and taxonomy. Melanoma is a malignant melanocytic neoplasm and is a result of cumulative genetic deregulation. The etiology of malignant melanoma (MM) is multifactorial and includes underlying genetic susceptibility, UV radiation, skin-type, and race. The majority of MM occurs on cutaneous surfaces and less commonly on mucosal and extra-cutaneous visceral organs. Regardless of location, MM exhibits clinical-pathological features that relate to horizontal or vertical tumor spread. Cutaneous and mucosal MM typically present as asymmetrical, irregularly bordered, large (> 0.5 cm), heterogeneous brown-black lesions with foci of erythema, atrophy or ulceration. As with melanocytic nevi, advances in melanomagenesis research have revealed primary oncogenic BRAF and NRAS mutations associated with cutaneous MM. Unlike their cutaneous counterparts, mucosal melanomas exhibit primary oncogenic alterations in c-KIT and other genes. This article will discuss the role of specific primary oncogenic and secondary/tertiary genetic defects in differential clinical presentation, anatomic distribution, future classification changes, and targeted therapy of melanoma. The clinical and microscopic features of mucosal melanomas and a summary of management guidelines will be discussed. Additionally, this article will cover the salient features of melanocytic neuroectodermal tumor of infancy, a neoplastic entity that can involve the oro-facial region, and the clinical-pathological features of selected, commonly occurring pigmented ectodermally-derived neoplasms that are often part of the clinical differential diagnosis of black-brown pigmented lesions."
30693378,"This Strategic Research Agenda identifies current challenges and needs in healthcare, illustrates how biomedical imaging and derived data can help to address these, and aims to stimulate dedicated research funding efforts.Medicine is currently moving towards a more tailored, patient-centric approach by providing personalised solutions for the individual patient. Innovation in biomedical imaging plays a key role in this process as it addresses the current needs for individualised prevention, treatment, therapy response monitoring, and image-guided surgery.The use of non-invasive biomarkers facilitates better therapy prediction and monitoring, leading to improved patient outcomes. Innovative diagnostic imaging technologies provide information about disease characteristics which, coupled with biological, genetic and -omics data, will contribute to an individualised diagnosis and therapy approach.In the emerging field of theranostics, imaging tools together with therapeutic agents enable the selection of best treatments and allow tailored therapeutic interventions.For prenatal monitoring, the use of innovative imaging technologies can ensure an early detection of malfunctions or disease.The application of biomedical imaging for diagnosis and management of lifestyle-induced diseases will help to avoid disease development through lifestyle changes.Artificial intelligence and machine learning in imaging will facilitate the improvement of image interpretation and lead to better disease prediction and therapy planning.As biomedical imaging technologies and analysis of existing imaging data provide solutions to current challenges and needs in healthcare, appropriate funding for dedicated research is needed to implement the innovative approaches for the wellbeing of citizens and patients."
30693373,"Multiple myeloma (MM) remains an incurable plasma cells malignancy because of its complex genetic heterogeneity and high relapse rate post immunotherapy. The encouraging results of chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) targeting B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) immunotherapy clinical trials have shed light on curing MM in recent years. However, many therapeutic side effects limit the promotion and clinical use of this novel effective approach such as cytokine release syndrome, antigen escape, and neurotoxicity. We should make every effort to do further study about this immunotherapy to make it safer and effective. This review focusing on this topic clarifies the following contents: present status of MM treatment, effectiveness of CAR-T cells, features of BCMA, preclinical and clinical trials of BCMA CAR-T cells therapy, and existing problems and strategies. Hoping to provide a reference for the subsequent correlative clinical and research."
30693367,There is a large inter-individual variation in the efficacy of valproic acid (VPA) against epilepsy. The genetic polymorphism influence of sodium channels on VPA response remains a matter of debate. The aim of the study was to explore the effect of SCN1A and SCN2A gene polymorphisms on VPA response in the treatment of epilepsy among Chinese patients.
30693177,"circNOL10 is a circular RNA expressed at low levels in lung cancer, though its functions in lung cancer remain unknown. Here, the function and molecular mechanism of circNOL10 in lung cancer development are investigated using in vitro and in vivo studies, and it is shown that circNOL10 significantly inhibits the development of lung cancer and that circNOL10 expression is co-regulated by methylation of its parental gene Pre-NOL10 and by splicing factor epithelial splicing regulatory protein 1 (ESRP1). circNOL10 promotes the expression of transcription factor sex comb on midleg-like 1 (SCML1) by inhibiting transcription factor ubiquitination and thus also affects regulation of the humanin (HN) polypeptide family by SCML1. circNOL10 also affects mitochondrial function through regulating the humanin polypeptide family and affecting multiple signaling pathways, ultimately inhibiting cell proliferation and cell cycle progression, and promoting the apoptosis of lung cancer cells, thereby inhibiting lung cancer development. This study investigates the functions and molecular mechanisms of circNOL10 in the development of lung cancer and reveals its involvement in the transcriptional regulation of the HN polypeptide family by SCML1. The results also demonstrate the inhibitory effect of HN on lung cancer cells growth. These findings may identify novel targets for the molecular therapy of lung cancer."
30693031,"Cisplatin (DDP) is one of the most commonly used chemotherapeutic drugs for several cancers, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, resistance to DDP eventually develops, limiting its further application. New therapy targets are urgently needed to reverse DDP resistance."
30692987,"Adenosine deaminase 2 (ADA2) deficiency is an auto-inflammatory disease due to mutations in cat eye syndrome chromosome region candidate 1 (<i>CECR1</i>) gene, currently named <i>ADA2</i>. The disease has a wide clinical spectrum encompassing early-onset vasculopathy (targeting skin, gut and central nervous system), recurrent fever, immunodeficiency and bone marrow dysfunction. Different therapeutic options have been proposed in literature, but only steroids and anti-cytokine monoclonal antibodies (such as tumor necrosis factor inhibitor) proved to be effective. If a suitable donor is available, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) could be curative. Here we describe a case of ADA2 deficiency in a 4-year-old Caucasian girl. The patient was initially classified as autoimmune neutropenia and then she evolved toward an autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS)-like phenotype. The diagnosis of ALPS became uncertain due to atypical clinical features and normal FAS-induced apoptosis test. She was treated with G-CSF first and subsequently with immunosuppressive drugs without improvement. Only HSCT from a 9/10 HLA-matched unrelated donor, following myeloablative conditioning, completely solved the clinical signs related to ADA2 deficiency. Early diagnosis in cases presenting with hematological manifestations, rather than classical vasculopathy, allows the patients to promptly undergo HSCT and avoid more severe evolution. Finally, in similar cases highly suspicious for genetic disease, it is desirable to obtain molecular diagnosis before performing HSCT, since it can influence the transplant procedure. However, if HSCT has to be performed without delay for clinical indication, related donors should be excluded to avoid the risk of relapse or partial benefit due to a hereditary genetic defect."
30692720,"Underactive bladder (UAB) is defined by the International Continence Society as a symptom complex characterized by a slow urinary stream, hesitancy, and straining to void, with or without a feeling of incomplete bladder emptying sometimes with storage symptoms. Until recently, the topic has received little attention in the literature probably due to a lack of consistent definitions and diagnostic criteria. We performed a literature review to identify articles related to the diagnosis and management of UAB, specifically in female patients. UAB is a common clinical entity, occurring in up to 45% of females depending on definitions used. Prevalence increases significantly in elderly women and women who live in long-term care facilities. The exact etiology and pathophysiology for developing UAB is unknown, though it is likely a multifactorial process with contributory neurogenic, cardiovascular, and idiopathic causes. There are currently no validated questionnaires for diagnosing or monitoring treatment for patients with UAB. Management options for females with UAB remain limited, with clean intermittent catheterization, the most commonly used. No pharmacotherapies have consistently been proven to be beneficial. Neuromodulation has had the most promising results in terms of symptom improvement, with newer technologies such as stem-cell therapy and gene therapy requiring more evidence before widespread use. Although UAB has received increased recognition and has been a focus of research in recent years, there remains a lack of diagnostic and therapeutic tools. Future research goals should include the development of targeted therapeutic interventions based on pathophysiologic mechanisms and validated diagnostic questionnaires."
30692684,"The Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib has substantially improved therapeutic options for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Although ibrutinib is not curative, it has a profound effect on CLL cells and may create new pharmacologically exploitable vulnerabilities. To identify such vulnerabilities, we developed a systematic approach that combines epigenome profiling (charting the gene-regulatory basis of cell state) with single-cell chemosensitivity profiling (quantifying cell-type-specific drug response) and bioinformatic data integration. By applying our method to a cohort of matched patient samples collected before and during ibrutinib therapy, we identified characteristic ibrutinib-induced changes that provide a starting point for the rational design of ibrutinib combination therapies. Specifically, we observed and validated preferential sensitivity to proteasome, PLK1, and mTOR inhibitors during ibrutinib treatment. More generally, our study establishes a broadly applicable method for investigating treatment-specific vulnerabilities by integrating the complementary perspectives of epigenetic cell states and phenotypic drug responses in primary patient samples."
30692673,"Developing safe and efficient non-viral delivery systems remains a major challenge for in vivo applications of gene therapy, especially in cystic fibrosis. Unlike conventional cationic polymers or lipids, the emerging poloxamine-based copolymers display promising in vivo gene delivery capabilities. However, poloxamines are invalid for in vitro applications and their in vivo transfection efficiency is still low compared with viral vectors. Here, we show that peptides developed by modular design approaches can spontaneously form compact and monodisperse nanoparticles with poloxamines and nucleic acids via self-assembly. Both messenger RNA and plasmid DNA expression mediated by peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles are greatly boosted in vitro and in the lungs of cystic fibrosis mice with negligible toxicity. Peptide-poloxamine nanoparticles containing integrating vectors enable successful in vitro and in vivo long-term restoration of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator deficiency with a safe integration profile. Our dataset provides a new framework for designing non-viral gene delivery systems qualified for in vivo genetic modifications."
30692642,"In mammalian cells, autophagy is the major pathway for the degradation and recycling of obsolete and potentially noxious cytoplasmic materials, including proteins, lipids, and whole organelles, through the lysosomes. Autophagy maintains cellular and tissue homeostasis and provides a mechanism to adapt to extracellular cues and metabolic stressors. Emerging evidence unravels a critical function of autophagy in endothelial cells (ECs), the major components of the blood vasculature, which delivers nutrients and oxygen to the parenchymal tissue. EC-intrinsic autophagy modulates the response of ECs to various metabolic stressors and has a fundamental role in redox homeostasis and EC plasticity. In recent years moreover, genetic evidence suggests that autophagy regulates pathological angiogenesis, a hallmark of solid tumors. In the hypoxic, nutrient-deprived, and pro-angiogenic tumor microenvironment, heightened autophagy in the blood vessels is emerging as a critical mechanism enabling ECs to dynamically accommodate their higher bioenergetics demands to the extracellular environment and connect with other components of the tumor stroma through paracrine signaling. In this review, we provide an overview of the major cellular mechanisms regulated by autophagy in ECs and discuss their potential role in tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and response to anticancer therapy."
30692605,"Efficient transduction of the retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) is a prerequisite to maximize therapeutic outcomes in any form of gene therapy for optic neuropathies. Whereas subretinal injection of adeno-associated virus 2 (AAV2) has been well-characterized, the serotype, viral load, and promoter combinations that govern RGC transduction efficiency following intravitreal injection remains poorly understood. We evaluated the transduction efficiency of seven AAV2 serotypes (AAV2/1, AAV2/2, AAV2/4, AAV2/5, AAV2/6, AAV2/8, and AAV2/9) for the RGCs at 4 weeks following intravitreal injection in C57BL/6J mice. Intravitreal injection of 1 × 10<sup>9</sup> vg of AAV2/2 with eGFP driven by the CMV promoter attained a higher transduction efficiency for the RGCs (60.0 ± 4.2%) compared with the six other AAV2 serotypes with eGFP driven by the same promoter injected at the same viral load ( < 3.0%). Reporter driven by the CAG promoter had a lower transduction efficiency (up to 42.0 ± 5.8%) compared with that driven by the CMV reporter (60.0 ± 4.2%, p ≤ 0.024). There was a viral dose-dependent transduction effect of AAV2/2-CMV-eGFP and the transduction efficiency was 40.2 ± 3.9%, 16.6 ± 4.2%, and 2.6 ± 0.2% when the viral load decreased to 5 × 10<sup>8 </sup>vg, 1 × 10<sup>8</sup> vg, and 1 × 10<sup>7 </sup>vg, respectively. Optimizing viral serotype, viral load, and promoter construct of AAV2 is important to maximize transgene expression in RGC-targeted gene therapy."
30692604,"Gene therapy technologies are inevitably required to boost the therapeutic performance of cell therapies; thus, validating the efficacy of gene carriers specifically used for preparing cellular therapeutics is a prerequisite for evaluating the therapeutic capabilities of gene and cell combinatorial therapies. Herein, the efficacy of a recombinant adeno-associated virus derivative (rAAVr3.45) was examined to evaluate its potential as a gene carrier for genetically manipulating interleukin-10 (IL10)-secreting human neural stem cells (hNSCs) that can potentially treat ischemic injuries or neurological disorders. Safety issues that could arise during the virus preparation or viral infection were investigated; no replication-competent AAVs were detected in the final cell suspensions, transgene expression was mostly transient, and no severe interference on endogenous gene expression by viral infection occurred. IL10 secretion from hNSCs infected by rAAVr3.45 encoding IL10 did not alter the transcriptional profile of any gene by more than threefold, but the exogenously boosted IL10 was sufficient to provoke immunomodulatory effects in an ischemic brain injury animal model, thereby accelerating the recovery of neurological deficits and the reduction of brain infarction volume. This study presents evidence that rAAVr3.45 can be potentially used as a gene carrier to prepare stem cell therapeutics."
30692600,"Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men globally. Prostate cancer patients at advanced stages are usually treated with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). However, with disease progression, it often becomes the incurable castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). JC polyomavirus (JCPyV) is a human DNA virus. Its virus-like particles (VLPs) exhibit similar tropism to native virions and they are capable of delivering exogenous genes to the target cells for expression. JCPyV has been detected in prostate cells; therefore, prostate cancer cells may be susceptible to JCPyV infection and JCPyV VLPs may be used as a vector for gene therapy against prostate cancer. Here we constructed a plasmid (pPSAtk) that allows expression of the thymidine kinase suicide gene only in androgen receptor (AR) positive prostate cancer cells using the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) promoter, and used JCPyV VLPs as a vector to carry pPSAtk (PSAtk-VLPs) for transcriptional targeting in prostate cancer cells. In this study, we found that PSAtk-VLPs could only kill AR-positive CRPC 22Rv1 cells in vitro and inhibit the growth of tumor nodules in the xenograft mouse model. Our results reveal that PSAtk-VLPs could potentially be used as a new option for treating CRPC patients in the future."
30692503,"A 78-year-old man was admitted with diarrhea. Colonoscopy and computed tomography(CT)revealed rectal cancer with multiple liver metastases. Low anterior resection was performed for local control. After the operation, 5 courses of mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab chemotherapy were administered as first-line systemic therapy, but CT showed progressive disease with liver metastases. After the first-line systemic therapy, 2 courses of FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab chemotherapy were performed as second-line systemic therapy, but CT also revealed progressive disease with liver metastases. We retrospectively performed comprehensive genomic sequencing with a 415-gene panel and found that the patient had a hypermutation subtype. Interestingly, the panel also revealed that he had mismatch-repair(MMR)deficiency with MSH2 mutation, which is reported as a possible cause of resistance to 5-fluorouracil in colorectal cancer."
30692484,"A 50s man visited our hospital because of abdominal pain that initiated 1 day prior. An approximately 4.0×5.0×4.5c m tumor, which was in contact with the greater curvature of the gastric body, was detected on contrast-enhanced computed tomography. He was diagnosed with a ruptured gastrointestinal stromal tumor and underwent emergency surgery. During the operation, about 250mL of bloody ascites and a ruptured tumor measuring 6-7 cm in size was observed in the middle of the gastric body. Partial gastrectomy was performed. The histopathological diagnosis was GIST of the stomach. In the gene search, PDGFR-a mutation D842V was detected in exon 18. Therefore, he is undergoing a follow-up examination without postoperative adjuvant therapy even though he is classified as high-risk. Currently, the patient has survived for 8 months after surgery without recurrence. We should perform careful follow-up of the patient."
30692384,"The patient was a man in his 40s, who had undergone laparoscopic ileocecal resection with lymph node dissection(D3)for cecal cancer in January 2012. Histopathological examination of the resected specimens had revealed StageⅡ primary tumor with subserosal invasion and positive metastasis in 1-3 regional lymph nodes(pT2[SS]n1[+]). The pathological stage was Ⅲa(fStage Ⅲa), and the tumor showed RAS gene mutation. The patient was administered 5 cycles of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with oral tegafur/uracil(UFT)in combination with calcium folinate(UZEL). Abdominal computed tomography( CT)performed 1.5 years postoperatively revealed liver metastasis, and a laparoscopic partial hepatectomy was performed in August 2015. In addition, a node in the greater omentum, located in the inferior surface of the liver, was also resected. Histopathological examination of the resected specimens revealed peritoneal metastasis, based on the identification of the same type of adenocarcinoma as the colon cancer. The patient was given 8 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine and oxaliplatin(CapeOX). Then, he presented with colonic ileus, caused by recurrent dissemination, and underwent a laparoscopic transverse colectomy in October 2015. Multiple perineal disseminations were found intraoperatively, and chemotherapy was initiated with irinotecan plus tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil(S-1)plus bevacizumab(IRIS/BV)for the recurrent and unresectable disease. After 27 cycles of this regimen, lung metastasis was detected; in addition, progression of the para-aortic node metastasis around the celiac plexus was also observed, and the patient was considered as having pro- gressive disease(PD). Treatment with trifluridine/tipiracil(TAS102)was started in September 2017. Prior to the initiation of this regimen, the dose of opioid rescue medication previously started for back and abdominal pain was rapidly increased. Accordingly, the base dose was increased, but the pain could not be controlled, and the major pain was consistently located along the area of innervation in the celiac plexus. Therefore, celiac plexus neurolysis(CPN)was performed as a local therapy. A CT-guided injection technique was used to administer urografin, bupivacaine, and absolute ethanol to complete the procedure. The patient was discharged without major complications, and the base opioid dose was gradually reduced. Since the patient did not require any rescue medication during daytime on some days, the reduction of the base opioid dose was significantly effective in improving the patient's quality of life(QOL). In patients with pain possibly caused by metastasis to the para-aortic nodes, this local therapy technique may be considered."
30692147,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a class of RNA that is under increasing scrutiny, although their functional roles are debated. We analyzed RNA-seq data of 348 primary breast cancers and developed a method to identify circRNAs that does not rely on unmapped reads or known splice-junctions. We identified 95,843 circRNAs, of which 20,441 were found recurrently. Of the circRNAs that match exon-boundaries of the same gene, 668 showed a poor or even negative (R<0.2) correlation with the expression level of the linear gene. In silico analysis showed only a minority (8.5%) of circRNAs could be explained by known splicing events. Both these observations suggest that specific regulatory processes for circRNAs exist. We confirmed the presence of circRNAs of CNOT2, CREBBP and RERE in an independent pool of primary breast cancers. We identified circRNA profiles associated with subgroups of breast cancers and with biological and clinical features such as amount of tumor lymphocytic infiltrate and proliferation index. siRNA-mediated knockdown of circCNOT2 was shown to significantly reduce viability of breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and BT-474, further underlining the biological relevance of circRNAs. Furthermore, we found that circular and not linear CNOT2 levels are predictive for progression-free survival time to aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy in advanced breast cancer patients and found that circCNOT2 is detectable in cell-free RNA from plasma. We showed that circRNAs are abundantly present, show characteristics of being specifically regulated, are associated with clinical and biological properties, and thus are relevant in breast cancer."
30692123,"A large unmet medical need exists for safer anti-thrombotic drugs since all currently approved anticoagulants interfere with hemostasis leading to an increased risk of bleeding. Genetic and pharmacological evidence in humans and animals suggest that reducing Factor XI (FXI) levels has the potential to effectively prevent and treat thrombosis with minimal risk of bleeding. We generated a fully human antibody-MAA868-that binds the catalytic domain of both FXI (zymogen) and the activated FXI (FXIa). Our structural studies show that MAA868 traps FXI and FXIa in an inactive, zymogen-like conformation, explaining its equally high binding affinity for both forms of the enzyme. This binding mode allows the enzyme to be neutralized before entering the coagulation process revealing a particularly attractive anticoagulant profile of the antibody. MAA868 showed favorable anticoagulant activity in mice with a dose dependent protection from carotid occlusion in a FeCl<sub>3</sub> induced thrombosis model. MAA868 also caused robust and sustained anticoagulant activity in cynomolgus monkeys as assessed by aPTT without any evidence of bleeding. Based on these preclinical findings, we conducted a first in human study in healthy subjects demonstrating that single subcutaneous doses of MAA868 were safe and well tolerated. MAA868 resulted in dose and time-dependent robust and sustained aPTT prolongation and FXI suppression for up to 4 weeks or longer, supporting further clinical investigation as potential once monthly subcutaneous anticoagulant therapy."
30691685,"Dormancy occurs when cells remain viable but stop proliferating. When most of a cancer population undergoes this phenomenon, the result is called tumor dormancy, and when a single cancer cell undergoes this process, it is termed quiescence. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) share several overlapping characteristics and signaling pathways with dormant cancer cells, including therapy resistance, and an ability to metastasize and evade the immune system. Cancer cells can be broadly grouped into dormancy-competent CSCs (DCCs), cancer-repopulating cells (CRCs), dormancy-incompetent CSCs and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs). The settings in which cancer cells exploit the dormancy phase to survive and adapt are: (i) primary cancer dormancy; (ii) metastatic dormancy; (iii) therapy-induced dormancy; and (iv) immunologic dormancy. Dormancy, therapy resistance and plasticity of CSCs are fundamentally interconnected processes mediated through mechanisms involving reversible genetic alterations. Niches including metastatic, bone marrow, and perivascular are known to harbor dormant cancer cells. Mechanisms of dormancy induction are complex and multi-factorial and can involve angiogenic switching, addictive oncogene inhibition, immunoediting, anoikis, therapy, autophagy, senescence, epigenetic, and biophysical regulation. Therapy can have opposing effects on cancer cells with respect to dormancy; some therapies can induce dormancy, while others can reactivate dormant cells. There is a lack of consensus relative to the value of therapy-induced dormancy, i.e., some researchers view dormancy induction as a beneficial strategy as it can lead to metastasis inhibition, while others argue that reactivating dormant cancer cells and then eliminating them through therapy are a better approach. More focused investigations of intrinsic cell kinetics and environmental dynamics that promote and maintain cancer cells in a dormant state, and the long-term consequences of dormancy are critical for improving current therapeutic treatment outcomes."
30691586,"Diagnostic tests for vascular erectile dysfunction (ED) depend on cavernous smooth muscles (CSM) relaxation following an intracorporal injection (ICI). Enhanced sympathetic tone, which is not uncommon during performance of these tests, can bias its results. Also, CSM diseases can cause veno-occlusive diseases (VOD) ED. Corpus cavernosum electromyography (CC-EMG) potentials' amplitudes represent the integrated sympathetic activity of healthy CSM. Stem-cells and gene-therapy are potential therapeutic options for impaired CSM."
30691366,"Advances in human genome editing, in particular the development of the clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 method, have led to increasing concerns about the ethics of editing the human genome. In response, the US National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine constituted a multidisciplinary, international committee to review the current status and make recommendations. I was a member of that committee, and the core of this review reflects the committee's conclusions. The committee's report, issued in February 2017, recommends the application of current ethical and regulatory standards for gene therapy to somatic (nonheritable) human genome editing. It also recommends allowing experimental germline genome editing to proceed if ( a) it is restricted to preventing transmission of a serious disease or condition, ( b) the edit is a modification to a common DNA sequence known not to be associated with disease, and ( c) the research is conducted under a stringent set of ethical and regulatory requirements. Crossing the so-called red line of germline genome editing raises important bioethical issues, most importantly, serious concern about the potential negative impact on individuals with disabilities. This review highlights some of the major ethical considerations in human genome editing in light of the report's recommendations."
30691222,"The response of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) to the first-line conventional combination therapy is highly variable, reflecting the elevated heterogeneity of the disease. The genetic alterations underlying this heterogeneity have been thoroughly characterized through omic approaches requiring elevated efforts and costs. In order to translate the knowledge of CRC molecular heterogeneity into a practical clinical approach, we utilized a simplified Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) based platform to screen a cohort of 77 patients treated with first-line conventional therapy. Samples were sequenced using a panel of hotspots and targeted regions of 22 genes commonly involved in CRC. This revealed 51 patients carrying actionable gene mutations, 22 of which carried druggable alterations. These mutations were frequently associated with additional genetic alterations. To take into account this molecular complexity and assisted by an unbiased bioinformatic analysis, we defined three subgroups of patients carrying distinct molecular patterns. We demonstrated these three molecular subgroups are associated with a different response to first-line conventional combination therapies. The best outcome was achieved in patients exclusively carrying mutations on <i>TP53</i> and/or <i>RAS</i> genes. By contrast, in patients carrying mutations in any of the other genes, alone or associated with mutations of <i>TP53/RAS</i>, the expected response is much worse compared to patients with exclusive <i>TP53/RAS</i> mutations. Additionally, our data indicate that the standard approach has limited efficacy in patients without any mutations in the genes included in the panel. In conclusion, we identified a reliable and easy-to-use approach for a simplified molecular-based stratification of mCRC patients that predicts the efficacy of the first-line conventional combination therapy."
30691194,"Imerslund-Gräsbeck syndrome (IGS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder clinically characterized by megaloblastic anemia, benign mild proteinuria, and other nonspecific symptoms. Several pathogenetic variants in the amnionless (<i>AMN</i>) or cubilin (<i>CUBN</i>) genes have been described in IGS. We describe a case of IGS with urinary tract infection and mild but persistent proteinuria at onset in an 11-month-old female child. With the appearance of macrocytic anemia, aphthous stomatitis, and neurological signs, IGS was clinically suspected, and vitamin B12 parenteral therapy was started. Sequence analysis showed the presence of a novel intronic variant c.513+5G>A of <i>AMN</i>, never before described in the literature, that was in compound heterozygosity with the known pathogenetic variant c.1006+34_1007-31del. Analysis extension to the parents revealed the presence of variant c.1006+34_1007-31 in the father and c.513+5G>A in the mother. In the present case with IGS, the novel intronic variant of <i>AMN</i> was identified in ""<i>trans</i>"" with a known pathogenic variant (c.1006-31 del) and the new variant was interpreted to be pathogenetic since it was not found in the public database of polymorphisms and because it was predicted to alter a donor splicing site. Our case underlines the relevance in detecting certain subtle symptoms, such as mild but persistent proteinuria associated with megaloblastic anemia, to reach a correct diagnosis of a rare but treatable disorder."
30691124,"Kidney injury due to focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) is the most common primary glomerular disorder causing end-stage renal disease. Homozygous mutations in either glomerular basement membrane or slit diaphragm genes cause early renal failure. Heterozygous carriers develop renal symptoms late, if at all. In contrast to mutations in slit diaphragm genes, hetero- or hemizygous mutations in the X-chromosomal <i>COL4A5</i> Alport gene have not yet been recognized as a major cause of kidney injury by FSGS. We identified cases of FSGS that were unexpectedly diagnosed: In addition to mutations in the X-chromosomal <i>COL4A5</i> type IV collagen gene, nephrin and podocin polymorphisms aggravated kidney damage, leading to FSGS with ruptures of the basement membrane in a toddler and early renal failure in heterozygous girls. The results of our case series study suggest a synergistic role for genes encoding basement membrane and slit diaphragm proteins as a cause of kidney injury due to FSGS. Our results demonstrate that the molecular genetics of different players in the glomerular filtration barrier can be used to evaluate causes of kidney injury. Given the high frequency of X-chromosomal carriers of Alport genes, the analysis of genes involved in the organization of podocyte architecture, the glomerular basement membrane, and the slit diaphragm will further improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of FSGS and guide prognosis of and therapy for hereditary glomerular kidney diseases."
30691064,"Decades ago, Friedmann and Roblin postulated several barriers to gene therapy, including tissue targeting, delivery across the blood⁻brain barrier (BBB), and host immune responses. These issues remain pertinent till today. Since then, several advances have been made in elucidating structures of adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotypes, antibody epitopes, and ways to modify antibody-binding sites. AAVs capsid has also been engineered to re-direct tissue tropism, reduce ubiquitination, and promote passage across the BBB. Furthermore, the use of high(er) dose recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been accompanied by a better understanding of immune responses in both experimental animals and early clinical trials, and novel work is being performed to modulate the immune response. While the immune responses to rAAV remains a major challenge in translating experimental drugs to approved medicine, and will likely require more than a single solution, we now better understand the hurdles to formulate and test experimental solutions to surmount them."
30691039,"Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is one of the most severe disorders among laminopathies-a heterogeneous group of genetic diseases with a molecular background based on mutations in the <i>LMNA</i> gene and genes coding for interacting proteins. HGPS is characterized by the presence of aging-associated symptoms, including lack of subcutaneous fat, alopecia, swollen veins, growth retardation, age spots, joint contractures, osteoporosis, cardiovascular pathology, and death due to heart attacks and strokes in childhood. <i>LMNA</i> codes for two major, alternatively spliced transcripts, give rise to lamin A and lamin C proteins. Mutations in the <i>LMNA</i> gene alone, depending on the nature and location, may result in the expression of abnormal protein or loss of protein expression and cause at least 11 disease phenotypes, differing in severity and affected tissue. <i>LMNA</i> gene-related HGPS is caused by a single mutation in the <i>LMNA</i> gene in exon 11. The mutation c.1824C > T results in activation of the cryptic donor splice site, which leads to the synthesis of progerin protein lacking 50 amino acids. The accumulation of progerin is the reason for appearance of the phenotype. In this review, we discuss current knowledge on the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of HGPS and provide a critical analysis of current research trends in this field. We also discuss the mouse models available so far, the current status of treatment of the disease, and future prospects for the development of efficient therapies, including gene therapy for HGPS."
30691008,"As dissemination through blood and lymph is the critical step of the metastatic cascade, circulating tumour cells (CTCs) have attracted wide attention as a potential surrogate marker to monitor progression into metastatic disease and response to therapy. In patients with invasive breast carcinoma (IBC), CTCs are being considered nowadays as a valid counterpart for the assessment of known prognostic and predictive factors. Molecular characterization of CTCs using protein detection, genomic and transcriptomic panels allows to depict IBC biology. Such molecular profiling of circulating cells with increased metastatic abilities appears to be essential, especially after tumour resection, as well as in advanced disseminated disease, when information crucial for identification of therapeutic targets becomes unobtainable from the primary site. If CTCs are truly representative of primary tumours and metastases, characterization of the molecular profile of this easily accessible 'biopsy' might be of prime importance for clinical practice in IBC patients. This review summarizes available data on feasibility and documented benefits of monitoring of essential IBC biological features in CTCs, with special reference to multifactorial proteomic, genomic, and transcriptomic panels of known prognostic or predictive value."
30690891,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype. Currently, no targeted treatment is available for TNBC, and the most common clinical therapy is tumor resection, which often promotes metastasis risks. Strong evidence suggests that the lymphatic metastasis is mediated by the C-C chemokine receptor type 7 (CCR7)/C-C motif chemokine ligand 21 crosstalk between tumor cells and the lymphatic system. It is hypothesized that CCR7 is a key immune modulator in the tumor microenvironment and the local blockade of CCR7 could effectively inhibit TNBC lymphatic metastasis. Accordingly, a plasmid encoding an antagonistic CCR7 affinity protein-CCR7 trap is delivered by tumor targeting nanoparticles in a highly metastatic 4T1 TNBC mouse model. Results show that CCR7 traps are transiently expressed, locally disrupt the signaling pathways in the tumor site, and efficiently inhibit TNBC lymphatic metastasis, without inducing immunosuppression as observed in systemic therapies using CCR7 monoclonal antibody. Significantly, upon applying CCR7 trap therapy prior to tumor resection, a 4T1 TNBC mouse model shows good prognosis without any further metastasis and relapse. In addition, CCR7 trap therapy efficiently inhibits the lymphatic metastasis in a B16F10 melanoma mouse model, indicating its great potential for various metastatic diseases treatment."
30690883,"Lung cancer is the most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide; hence, it is imperative that the mechanisms underlying the malignant properties of lung cancer be uncovered in order to efficiently treat this disease. Increasing evidence has shown that WT1-interacting protein (WTIP) plays important roles both physiologically and pathologically in humans; however, the role of WTIP in cancer is unknown. Here, we investigated the role and mechanism of WTIP in cell proliferation and tumorigenesis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report that WTIP is a tumor suppressor in human NSCLC. We found that WTIP expression was significantly reduced in both NSCLC cell lines and clinical specimens compared to that in normal controls; this reduction was largely attributed to promoter hypermethylation. Downregulation of WTIP significantly correlates with poor prognosis and predicts a shorter overall survival and progression-free survival among NSCLC patients. Moreover, ectopic overexpression of WTIP dramatically inhibits cell proliferation and tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo; conversely, depletion of WTIP expression shows the opposite effects. Mechanistically, WTIP impairs AKT phosphorylation and activation, leading to enhanced expression and transcriptional activity of FOXO1, which further increases p21Cip1 and p27Kip1, and decreases cyclin D1 which consequently results in cell cycle arrest. Collectively, the results of the current study indicate that WTIP is an important proliferation-related gene and that WTIP expression may represent a novel prognostic biomarker for NSCLC."
30690877,"Several new renal tumor types with distinctive pathologic, epidemiologic, and genetic signatures have recently been adopted in the fourth edition of the World Health Organization classification. In succeeding years, the cytologic features of most of these new types have been described, adding to the trend of increasing diagnostic accuracy for most common renal cell carcinoma subtypes and the important diagnostic role of cytologic sampling in the management and personalization of therapy. The current article reviews the cytologic findings from these recently established renal cell carcinoma subtypes. Emphasis is placed on cytologic diagnostic clues, confirmatory ancillary testing, salient differential diagnoses, and challenges that can be encountered in an attempt to render accurate interpretations in small samples."
30690475,Pharmacogenomic studies have used genetic variants to identify smokers likely to respond to pharmacological treatments for smoking cessation.
30690229,"Gene therapy represents an attractive alternative to treat hemophilia B. Here we established three hepatocyte-derived cell lines based on Huh7, PLC/PRF/5, and Hep3B cells stably carrying a mutated canine FIX (cFIXmut) transgene containing a single point mutation in the catalytic domain. Based on these in vitro models resembling a commonly used canine large animal model, the tetracycline-controlled transcriptional activator (Tet-on)-inducible CRISPR/Cas9 system and an optimized donor were used to correct mutated cFIX gene through homology-directed repair (HDR). For efficient delivery of designer nuclease and donor DNA, we produced a high-capacity adenovirus vector type 5 (HCAdV5) containing the Tet-on-inducible cFIX-specific CRISPR/Cas9 system and a single-stranded adeno-associated virus type 2 vector (ssAAV2) containing the modified donor. Moreover, we designed a single HCAdV5 delivering all components for HDR. Our amplification-refractory mutation system based on qPCR analysis (ARMS-qPCR) revealed that the single vector application in Huh7-cFIXmut cells resulted in up to 5.52% HDR efficiencies, which was superior to the two-vector strategy. Furthermore the single vector also resulted in increased phenotypic correction efficiencies assayed by ELISA. We conclude that HDR in combination with viral vector delivery holds great promise for the correction of mutated FIX in disease models."
30690194,"The personalized therapy for hypertension needs comprehensive knowledge about how blood pressures (BPs; systolic and diastolic) and their pulsatile and steady components are controlled by genetic factors. Here, we propose a unified pharmacodynamic (PD) functional mapping framework for identifying specific quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that mediate multivariate response-dose curves of BP. This framework can characterize how QTLs govern pulsatile and steady components through jointly regulating systolic and diastolic pressures. The model can quantify the genetic effects of individual QTLs on maximal drug effect, the maximal rate of drug response, and the dose window of maximal drug response. This unified mapping framework provides a tool for identifying pharmacological genes potentially useful to design the right medication and right dose for patients."
30690106,"Viral gene therapy is a means of delivering genes to replace malfunctioning ones, to kill cancer cells, or to correct genetic mutations. This technology is emerging as a powerful clinical tool; however, it is still limited by viral tropism, uptake and clearance by the liver, and most importantly an immune response. To overcome these challenges, we sought to merge the robustness of viral gene expression and the versatility of nanoparticle technology. Here, we describe a method for cloaking adenovirus (Ad) in silica (SiAd) as a nanoparticle formulation that significantly enhances transduction. Intratumoral injections in human glioma xenografts revealed SiAd expressing luciferase improved tumor transduction while reducing liver uptake. In immune-competent mice SiAd induced no inflammatory cytokines and reduced production of neutralizing antibodies. Finally, SiAd expressing TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand inhibited tumor growth of glioma xenografts. These results reveal that silica cloaking of Ad can enhance viral gene delivery while reducing immunogenicity."
30689859,"Choroideremia (CHM) is an x-linked recessive chorioretinal dystrophy, with 30% caused by nonsense mutations in the CHM gene resulting in an in-frame premature termination codon (PTC). Nonsense mediated decay (NMD) is the cell's natural surveillance mechanism, that detects and destroys PTC containing transcripts, with UPF1 being the central NMD modulator. NMD efficiency can be variable amongst individuals with some transcripts escaping destruction, leading to the production of a truncated non-functional or partially functional protein. Nonsense suppression drugs, such as ataluren, target these transcripts and read-through the PTC, leading to the production of a full length functional protein. Patients with higher transcript levels are considered to respond better to these drugs, as more substrate is available for read-through. Using RT-qPCR, we show that CHM mRNA expression in blood from nonsense mutation CHM patients is 2.8-fold lower than controls, and varies widely amongst patients, with 40% variation between those carrying the same UGA mutation (c.715 C > T; p.[R239*]). These results indicate that although NMD machinery is at work, efficiency is highly variable and not wholly dependent on mutation position. No significant difference in CHM mRNA levels was seen between two patients' fibroblasts and their iPSC-derived RPE. There was no correlation between CHM mRNA expression and genotype, phenotype or UPF1 transcript levels. NMD inhibition with caffeine was shown to restore CHM mRNA transcripts to near wildtype levels. Baseline mRNA levels may provide a prognostic indicator for response to nonsense suppression therapy, and caffeine may be a useful adjunct to enhance treatment efficacy where indicated."
30689765,It is important to identify patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) refractory to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy to avoid potential adverse effects and adopt different treatment strategies. We aimed to identify and validate clinical and genetic factors to predict anti-TNF response in patients with IBD.
30689738,"In patients with aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, a decrease in catecholamines and serotonin levels in the brain leads to developmental delay and movement disorders. The beneficial effects of gene therapy in patients from 1 to 8 years of age with homogeneous severity of disease have been reported from Taiwan. We conducted an open-label phase 1/2 study of population including adolescent patients with different degrees of severity. Six patients were enrolled: four males (ages 4, 10, 15 and 19 years) and one female (age 12 years) with a severe phenotype who were not capable of voluntary movement or speech, and one female (age 5 years) with a moderate phenotype who could walk with support. The patients received a total of 2 × 1011 vector genomes of adeno-associated virus vector harbouring DDC via bilateral intraputaminal infusions. At up to 2 years after gene therapy, the motor function was remarkably improved in all patients. Three patients with the severe phenotype were able to stand with support, and one patient could walk with a walker, while the patient with the moderate phenotype could run and ride a bicycle. This moderate-phenotype patient also showed improvement in her mental function, being able to converse fluently and perform simple arithmetic. Dystonia disappeared and oculogyric crisis was markedly decreased in all patients. The patients exhibited transient choreic dyskinesia for a couple of months, but no adverse events caused by vector were observed. PET with 6-[18F]fluoro-l-m-tyrosine, a specific tracer for AADC, showed a persistently increased uptake in the broad areas of the putamen. In our study, older patients (>8 years of age) also showed improvement, although treatment was more effective in younger patients. The genetic background of our patients was heterogeneous, and some patients suspected of having remnant enzyme activity showed better improvement than the Taiwanese patients. In addition to the alleviation of motor symptoms, the cognitive and verbal functions were improved in a patient with the moderate phenotype. The restoration of dopamine synthesis in the putamen via gene transfer provides transformative medical benefit across all patient ages, genotypes, and disease severities included in this study, with the most pronounced improvements noted in moderate patients.10.1093/brain/awy331_video1awy331media15991361892001."

30689007,"Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have enabled researchers to identify the genetic background underlying human illness. In addition, the latest genome editing technology, CRISPR-Cas9 (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein 9), provides great potential to edit genomic DNA sequences precisely with high efficiency. This technology has been evaluated for treatment of genetic diseases in recently published preclinical studies. Since many such genetic disorders can affect functional structures in the head and neck area, the technology bears high therapeutic potential in otorhinolaryngology."
30688890,"Pressure garment therapy, used for reduction of postburn scarring, is commonly initiated after complete healing of the wound or autograft. Although some clinicians have suggested that earlier treatment may improve outcomes, the effect of early initiation of therapy has not been studied in a controlled environment."
30688658,"Chromosomal integration of genome-intact HIV-1 sequences into the host genome creates a reservoir of virally infected cells that persists throughout life, necessitating indefinite antiretroviral suppression therapy. During effective antiviral treatment, the majority of these proviruses remain transcriptionally silent, but mechanisms responsible for viral latency are insufficiently clear. Here, we used matched integration site and proviral sequencing (MIP-Seq), an experimental approach involving multiple displacement amplification of individual proviral species, followed by near-full-length HIV-1 next-generation sequencing and corresponding chromosomal integration site analysis to selectively map the chromosomal positions of intact and defective proviruses in 3 HIV-1-infected individuals undergoing long-term antiretroviral therapy. Simultaneously, chromatin accessibility and gene expression in autologous CD4+ T cells were analyzed by assays for transposase-accessible chromatin using sequencing (ATAC-Seq) and RNA-Seq. We observed that in comparison to proviruses with defective sequences, intact HIV-1 proviruses were enriched for non-genic chromosomal positions and more frequently showed an opposite orientation relative to host genes. In addition, intact HIV-1 proviruses were preferentially integrated in either relative proximity to or increased distance from active transcriptional start sites and to accessible chromatin regions. These studies strongly suggest selection of intact proviruses with features of deeper viral latency during prolonged antiretroviral therapy, and may be informative for targeting the genome-intact viral reservoir."
30688548,"Inherited retinal degeneration (IRD), a group of rare retinal diseases that primarily lead to the progressive loss of retinal photoreceptor cells, can be inherited in all modes of inheritance: autosomal dominant (AD), autosomal recessive (AR), X-linked (XL), and mitochondrial. Based on the pattern of inheritance of the dystrophy, retinal gene therapy has 2 main strategies. AR, XL, and AD IRDs with haploinsufficiency can be treated by inserting a functional copy of the gene using either viral or nonviral vectors (gene augmentation). Different types of viral vectors and nonviral vectors are used to transfer plasmid DNA both in vitro and in vivo. AD IRDs with gain-of-function mutations or dominant-negative mutations can be treated by disrupting the mutant allele with (and occasionally without) gene augmentation. This review article aims to provide an overview of ocular gene therapy for treating IRDs using gene augmentation with viral or nonviral vectors or gene disruption through different gene-editing tools, especially with the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated (Cas) system."
30688157,"In the present study a combination of Transforming Growth Factor Beta 3 (TGF-β3) and Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2) loaded gelatin films sandwiched between poly (L-lactide) (PLLA)/poly (ε-caprolactone) (PCL) matrices were produced to enhance bone formation in alveolar bone defects. Osteogenic properties of tissue constructs were tested in alveolar bone defect model in rats. Bone healing was assessed by osteogenic gene expression levels of bone sialoprotein (BSP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), osteonectin (ON, SPARC), osteocalcin (OC), runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2), bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP) activity, histomorphometry and microtomography. Increase in osteogenic gene expression levels and BALP activity results showed that new bone formation was significantly accelerated in TGF-β3 + BMP-2 loaded scaffold group compared to growth factor free and only BMP-2 loaded groups. The micro-computed tomography (μ-CT) data from the 4<sup>th</sup> months revealed that (TGF-β3+ BMP-2) loaded scaffolds displayed increased bone formation and was able to fulfill 84% of the defect area (p < 0.05). Accelerated bone formation in the S-GF-B-T group compared to that of the S-GF group at the end of the 4th month was further verified via histomorphometric analysis (p = 0.008). Gene expression, BALP activity, microtomography and histomorphometry analysis indicated that (TGF-β3 + BMP-2) loaded PLLA/PCL scaffolds increased the new bone formation. BMP-2 loaded scaffolds were less effective than combination of TGF-β3 and BMP-2 loaded scaffolds. These findings demonstrated that focusing on the PLLA/PCL hybrid scaffolds combined with (TGF-β3 + BMP-2) may lay the groundwork for future therapy-oriented efforts to enhance bone formation in alveolar defects."
30688081,"Alopecia areata (AA) is a chronic, immune-mediated disorder that targets hair follicle epithelium, thereby restricting hair growth in localized patches. Although several therapies for AA have been tested, responses with traditional therapies have been limited. In recent years, numerous reports have been published of patients with AA responding to Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. This literature review aims to describe AA pathophysiology, explore how and why JAK inhibitors can be used for AA treatment, and review published case reports, case series, and open-label studies published to date. Pathogenesis of AA includes interactions between genetic, environmental, and immune factors and is mediated by the cytokines interferon-γ and interleukin (IL)-15. JAK inhibition resulting in hair regrowth in some cases supports that AA is associated with the Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK-STAT) signaling pathway. The emergence of JAK inhibitors for AA therapy is changing the way health care providers think about and treat AA. A mixture of animal model studies and human case studies have reported the use of baricitinib (JAK 1/2), ruxolitinib (JAK 1/2), and tofacitinib (JAK 1/3) for the management of AA. JAK inhibition has shown potential as an effective AA therapy when used in case studies, case series, and open-label trials. Formal clinical trials are ongoing and will yield more definitive conclusions about the safety and efficacy of JAK inhibitors."

30687136,"Antipsychotic drugs targeting dopamine neurotransmission are still the principal mean of therapeutic intervention for schizophrenia. However, about one third of people do not respond to dopaminergic antipsychotics. Genome wide association studies (GWAS), have shown that multiple genetic factors play a role in schizophrenia pathophysiology. Most of these schizophrenia risk variants are not related to dopamine or antipsychotic drugs mechanism of action. Genetic factors have also been implicated in defining response to antipsychotic medication. In contrast to disease risk, variation of genes coding for molecular targets of antipsychotics have been associated with treatment response. Among genes implicated, those involved in dopamine signaling mediated by D2-class dopamine receptor, including <i>DRD2</i> itself and its molecular effectors, have been implicated as key genetic predictors of response to treatments. Studies have also reported that genetic variation in genes coding for proteins that cross-talk with DRD2 at the molecular level, such as <i>AKT1, GSK3B, Beta-catenin</i>, and <i>PPP2R2B</i> are associated with response to antipsychotics. In this review we discuss the relative contribution to antipsychotic drug responsiveness of candidate genes and GWAS identified genes encoding proteins involved in dopamine responses. We also suggest that in addition of these older players, a deeper investigation of new GWAS identified schizophrenia risk genes such as <i>FXR1</i> can provide new prospects that are not clearly engaged in dopamine function while being targeted by dopamine-associated signaling molecules. Overall, further examination of genes proximally or distally related to signaling mechanisms engaged by medications and associated with disease risk and/or treatment responsiveness may uncover an interface between genes involved in disease causation with those affecting disease remediation. Such a nexus would provide realistic targets for therapy and further the development of genetically personalized approaches for schizophrenia."
30686784,"Super enhancers (SEs) are composed of clusters of enhancers in close genomic proximity. They constitute a large family of regulatory elements that specify gene expression patterns and cell identity. SE regions consist of unusually strong enrichment of binding sites for transcriptional factors, cofactors, and enhancers associated with epigenetic modifications. SEs play important roles in regulating the aberrant gene expression in tumor cells. Via SEs, cancer cells activate the expression of various oncogenes, and promote cell proliferation, invasion and migration properties. Hence suppression of SEs activities could inhibit the growth and survival of cancer cells. In this review, we summarize the fundamental principles, functions and regulation of super enhancers and therapeutic potential in targeting SEs in cancer cells, thereby introducing and providing new conceptions for development of antineoplastic drugs."
30686782,"Gene editing technologies are used to specifically edit the target sequence. With the development of zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN), regular clustering of short palindrome repeats (CRISPR) and single base editing (BE) techniques, gene editing technologies not only provide powerful tools for gene functional studies, but also offer new therapeutic strategies in biomedical research. Gene editing has demonstrated broad application prospects in the gene therapy field, as well as in the construction of animal and cell models, drug target screening and gene functional research. In this review, we summarize several typical gene editing technologies, their characteristics and applications in gene therapy and discusses their opportunities and challenges in gene therapy, thereby providing critical insights and references on the clinical application of gene editing technologies."
30686676,"Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is a life threatening condition with a considerable risk of major amputation and death. Besides revascularisation, no treatment has been proven to reduce the risks. Therapeutic angiogenesis by gene or cell therapy has not demonstrated definitive evidence in randomised controlled trials. PLX-PAD is an ""off the shelf"" allogeneic placental derived, mesenchymal like cell therapy, which, in preclinical studies, has shown pro-angiogenic, anti-inflammatory, and regenerative properties. Favourable one year amputation free survival (AFS), and trends in reduction of pain scores and increase of tissue perfusion have been shown in two small, open label, phase I trials."
30686635,"Transmission is a potential property of live viral vaccines that remains largely unexploited but may lie within the realm of many engineering designs. While likely unacceptable for vaccines of humans, transmission may be highly desirable for vaccines of wildlife, both to protect natural populations and also to limit zoonotic transmissions into humans. Defying intuition, transmission alone does not guarantee that a vaccine will perform well: the benefit of transmission over no transmission depends on and increases with the basic reproductive number of the vaccine, R<sub>0</sub>. The R<sub>0</sub> of an infectious agent in a homogeneous population is typically considered to be a fixed number, but some evidence suggests that dissemination of transmissible vaccines may change through time. One obvious possibility is that transmission will be greater from hosts directly vaccinated than from hosts who acquire the vaccine passively, but other types of change might also accrue. Whenever transmission changes over time, the R<sub>0</sub> estimated from directly vaccinated hosts will not reflect the vaccine's long term impact. As there is no theory on the consequences of changing transmission rates for a vaccine, we derive conditions for a transmissible vaccine with varying transmission rates to protect a population from pathogen invasion. Being the first in the transmission chain, the R<sub>0</sub> from directly vaccinated hosts has a larger effect than those from later steps in the chain. This mathematical property reveals that a transmissible vaccine with low long term transmission may nonetheless realize a big impact if early transmission is high. Furthermore, there may be ways to artificially elevate early transmission, thereby achieving high herd immunity from transmission while ensuring that the vaccine will ultimately die out."
30686588,"Hearing loss is the most common human sensory deficit. Its correction has been the goal of several gene-therapy based studies exploring a variety of interventions. Although these studies report varying degrees of success, all treatments have targeted developing inner ears in neonatal mice, a time point in the structural maturation of the cochlea prior to 26 weeks gestational age in humans. It is unclear whether cochlear gene therapy can salvage hearing in the mature organ of Corti. Herein, we report the first study to test gene therapy in an adult murine model of human deafness. Using a single intracochlear injection of an artificial microRNA carried in an AAV vector, we show that RNAi-mediated gene silencing can slow progression of hearing loss, improve inner hair cell survival, and prevent stereocilia bundle degeneration in the mature Beethoven mouse, a model of human TMC1 deafness. The ability to study gene therapy in mature murine ears constitutes a significant step toward its translation to human subjects."
30686549,"CAR-T cells are genetically modified human lymphocytes and gene therapy medicinal products. They are developed to treat cancers that express a membrane antigen targeted by the CAR. The FDA approved the two first-in-class medicinal products in 2017 and EMA in August 2018; both are autologous CAR-T cells targeting CD19 that is expressed at the surface of normal B-cells throughout their differentiation, and on B-cell lymphoid malignancies. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated for B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, although the marketing authorizations are less liberal in terms of indications. Manufacturing of these personalized treatments necessitates that a novel organization and supply chain be set in place, to ensure product preservation, patient safety and compliance with complex regulatory requirements. Side effects are commensurate with clinical efficacy and can be life-threatening: proper management imposes tight coordination between various specialists, particularly between hematologists and intensive care practitioners. High pricing for these treatments is part of a long-term trend for increasing costs of innovations in hematology and oncology; it questions the ability of healthcare systems to sustain their reimbursement."
30686531,"Anthrax toxin receptor 1 (ANTXR1) is a transmembrane protein with an extracellular domain which is deeply associated with the process of bone formation and plays an important role in angiogenesis. However, there have been no reports investigating the effects of ANTXR1 on bone metabolism mediated by the two types of bone cells, osteoclasts, and osteoblasts. The aim of this study is to reveal the role of ANTXR1 in the differentiation and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. We found that ANTXR1 positively regulated the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption with no effects on osteoblast differentiation by performing gain- and loss-of-function studies. During ANTXR1-mediated regulation of osteoclastogenesis, phosphorylation of early signal transducers such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Akt, inhibitor of kappa B (IκB), and phospholipase C gamma 2 (PLCγ2) was affected, which in turn altered the mRNA and protein levels of c-Fos and nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). In addition, genetic manipulation of ANTXR1 in bone marrow macrophages (BMMs) modulated the capillary-like tube formation in HUVECs via secretion of two angiogenic factors, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A). These results elucidated the importance of ANTXR1 in osteoclast differentiation and functional activity, as well as, osteoclast-mediated angiogenesis of endothelial cells. Taken together, we propose that ANTXR1 might be a promising candidate for gene therapy for bone metabolic diseases and further, might potentially serve as an important biomarker in the field of bone metastasis associated with vascularization."
30686507,"Pathogenic variants of the KCNJ13 gene are known to cause Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA16), an inherited pediatric blindness. KCNJ13 encodes the Kir7.1 subunit that acts as a tetrameric, inwardly rectifying potassium ion channel in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) to maintain ionic homeostasis and allow photoreceptors to encode visual information. We sought to determine whether genetic approaches might be effective in treating blindness arising from pathogenic variants in KCNJ13. We derived human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)-RPE cells from an individual carrying a homozygous c.158G>A (p.Trp53<sup>∗</sup>) pathogenic variant of KCNJ13. We performed biochemical and electrophysiology assays to confirm Kir7.1 function. We tested both small-molecule readthrough drug and gene-therapy approaches for this ""disease-in-a-dish"" approach. We found that the LCA16 hiPSC-RPE cells had normal morphology but did not express a functional Kir7.1 channel and were unable to demonstrate normal physiology. After readthrough drug treatment, the LCA16 hiPSC cells were hyperpolarized by 30 mV, and the Kir7.1 current was restored. Similarly, we rescued Kir7.1 channel function after lentiviral gene delivery to the hiPSC-RPE cells. In both approaches, Kir7.1 was expressed normally, and there was restoration of membrane potential and the Kir7.1 current. Loss-of-function variants of Kir7.1 are one cause of LCA. Using either readthrough therapy or gene augmentation, we rescued Kir7.1 channel function in iPSC-RPE cells derived from an affected individual. This supports the development of precision-medicine approaches for the treatment of clinical LCA16."
30686359,"ROLE OF THE HOSPITAL PHARMACIST IN THE MANAGEMENT OF A CATEGORY OF ADVANCED THERAPY MEDICINAL PRODUCT: CHIMERIC ANTIGEN RECEPTOR T-CELLS: Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cells (CART) belongs to a new class of medicine, Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product, such as define by the European Regulation 1394/2007, and more exactly to the category of gene therapy medicinal product. Their status of medicine, as well as genetically modified organisms, imposes a particular circuit at hospital while maintaining a way over the Hospital Pharmacy. The manipulation of genetically modified cells is not usual in pharmacy. It requires, besides the acquisition of new skills, a not insignificant reorganization of the teams and the rooms of the pharmacy as well as an adapted training of the staff. A good communication is essential between the various actors of the circuit. The hospital pharmacist plays a key role in the implementation of a circuit adapted to this new type of medicine. This article aims to identify the roles of the hospital pharmacist and more generally of the pharmacy in the management of CART. We shall detail the specificities of this type of medicine in every stage of the circuit and the adaptations necessary to realize to guarantee the quality and the safety of the treatment by CART. Beyond the implementation of the circuit in the hospital, the pharmacist has an important role to be played in the follow-up of the patients after administration in view of the complexity of the side effects and a certain role in the training of the teams to this new medicine.

30686355,"After the promising results obtained in North American academic centers suggesting the curative potential of these treatments, the development of T cells carrying a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) directed against the CD19 antigen has experienced rapid developments in recent years. Three major trials (each involving about 100 patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive B-cell lymphoma) were conducted and evaluated the efficacy of these treatments (Zuma-1, Juliet and Transcend). Tumor responses are observed in 52% to 82% of patients, with a best complete response (CR) rate of 40% to 58%. Although some patients with early CR may relapse rapidly, the quality of the response appears to improve over time for other patients in partial response, all of which result in a proportion of patients with prolonged CR by approximately 30% to 40% (up to more than one year after treatment). Toxicities (mostly early and reversible) are mainly represented by the cytokine release syndrome (severe in 1% to 22% of patients) and neurological disorders sometimes severe (in 12% to 31% of patients), while other patients develop cytopenias or hypogammaglobulinemia. The updating of these studies over time and the new developments (in the improvement of their conception and in their use) of the CAR-T will allow to better defining the place of these innovative and promising treatments in the therapeutic strategy of patients with lymphoma.

30686352,"BIOLOGY, CONCEPTS AND PRINCIPLES: The development of new anti-tumor immunotherapy approaches has recently dramatically increased. Progresses made in molecular biology and the development of various genetic manipulation tools allow the ""reprogrammation"" of T cells in order to make them express a chimeric receptor including the variable part of an immunoglobulin capable of recognizing a tumor antigen along with the expression of molecules involved in T-lymphocyte activation signaling. Genetically modified T-cells, called ""CAR (chimeric antigen receptors) -T cells"", have yielded impressive clinical results in the treatment of relapsed or refractory lymphoid hematological malignancies after conventional treatments and are in development in solid tumors. Different generations of CAR-T cells have been developed and technological progress makes it possible to envisage modulations of gene constructs that could further optimize the efficacy and tolerance of CAR-T cells. The first challenge of these approaches concerns the identification of specific tumor antigen targets in order to limit the on-target/off-tumor effects and the loss of expression of the target. Approaches i) targeting several antigens or ii) limiting the duration of expression of CAR in lymphocytes or iii) destroying CAR-T cells by a suicide gene. Interesting approaches are the second objective of improvement concerns the accessibility of CAR-T cells to tumor sites and the control of the immune escape mechanisms of tumor cells to the cytotoxicity of CAR-T cells. This issue is currently under the way of search of innovative strategies that should improve the clinical effectiveness of CAR-T cells, especially in solid tumors.

30686256,"The causes and progression of cancer are controlled by epigenetic processes, and thus the mechanisms involved in epigenetic regulation of cancer development and gene expression, gene and signaling pathways have been studied. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have a major impact on chromatin remodeling and epigenetics, making their inhibitors a very interesting area of research. This review is a comprehensive report on the literature published in the past few years. Histone deacetylase(HDAC) inhibitors consist of an attractive field for targeted therapy against cancer. This review is focused on the use of HDAC inhibitors as anticancer treatment and explains the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects on cancer. An analysis of the beneficial characteristics and drawbacks of HDAC inhibitors is presented, which will assist the pre-clinical and clinical researchers in the design of future experiments to improve the therapeutic efficacy of these drugs and circumvent the challenges in the path of successful epigenetic therapy. Future therapeutic strategies may include combination of HDAC inhibitors and chemotherapy or other inhibitors, to target multiple oncogenic signaling pathways."
30686254,"Cancer consists of heterogeneous multiple cell subpopulation which at a later stage develop resistant phenotypes, which include resistance to pro-apoptotic stimuli and/or cytotoxic resistance to anticancer compounds. The property of cancerous cells to affect almost any part of the body categorizes cancer to many anatomic and molecular subtypes, each requiring particular therapeutic intervention. As several modalities are hindered in a variety of cancers and as the cancer cells accrue varied types of oncogenic mutations during their progression the most likely benefit will be obtained by combination of therapeutic agents that might address the diverse hallmarks of cancer. Natural compounds are the backbone of cancer therapeutics owing to their property of affecting the DNA impairment and restoration mechanisms and also the gene expression modulated via several epigenetic molecular mechanisms. Bioactive peptides isolated from flora and fauna have transformed the arena of antitumour therapy and prompt progresses in preclinical studies are promising. The difficulties in creating ACP rests in improving its delivery to tumour site and it also must maintain a low toxicity profile. The substantial production costs, low selectivity and proteolytic stability of some ACP are some of the factors hindering the progress of peptide drug development. Recently, several publications have tried to edify the field with the idea of using peptides as adjuvants with established drugs for antineoplastic use. This review focuses on peptides from natural sources that precisely target tumour cells and subsequently serve as anticancer agents that are less toxic to normal tissues."
30686077,"Dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and Stargardt Macular Dystrophy (STGD1) result in vision loss, due to progressive atrophy of the macula and lack of effective treatments. Numerous studies have implicated complement-associated inflammation as a contributor to both diseases. Areas covered: The complement factor D inhibitor, lampalizumab, failed to halt geographic atrophy (GA) progression in phase 3 studies. The complement factor 3 (C3) inhibitor, APL-2, has shown potential to reduce GA growth in a phase 2 trial, supporting advancement to phase 3 trials. The intravenous complement factor 5 (C5) inhibitor, eculizumab, failed to halt GA progression in a phase 2 study. Another C5 inhibitor, avacincaptad pegol, is delivered by intravitreal injection, and will be studied for safety and preliminary signs of efficacy for AMD and STGD1 patients in phase 2 trials. LFG316 (C5 inhibitor) and CLG561 (properdin inhibitor) failed to halt GA progression in phase 2 studies. A phase 1 trial is evaluating the effects of combining LFG316 and CL561. Complement inhibition by gene therapy will be explored in the phase 1 trial of HMR59 in AMD patients. Expert opinion: While complement inhibition has not yet demonstrated ability to halt GA progression in a phase 3 trial, further study is warranted."
30686035,"Genetic polymorphism of thiopurine S-methyltransferase, the key enzyme in metabolism of thiopurines (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine) used in the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease, results in different enzyme activities. Decreased enzyme activity causes myelosuppression whereas abnormally high activity results in hepatotoxicity at standard thiopurine doses. Four allele variants (TMPT*2, TMPT*3A, TPMT*3B and TPMT*3C) account for decreased activity in more than 95% of cases."
30685867,"Despite major advances in medical, catheter-based or surgical treatment, cardiovascular diseases such as peripheral artery disease and coronary artery disease still cause signiﬁcant morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, many patients do not qualify for catheter-based treatment or bypass surgery because of advanced disease or surgical risk. There is therefore an urgent need for novel treatment strategies. Therapeutic angiogenesis aims to restore blood flow to ischaemic tissue by stimulating the growth of new blood vessels through the local delivery of angiogenic factors, and may thus be an attractive treatment alternative for these patients. Angiogenesis is a complex process and the growth of normal, stable and functional vasculature depends on the coordinated interplay of different cell types and growth factors. Vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) is the fundamental regulator of vascular growth and the key target of therapeutic angiogenesis approaches. However, first-generation clinical trials of VEGF gene therapy have been disappointing, and a clear clinical benefit has yet to be established. In particular, VEGF delivery (a) appears to have a very limited therapeutic window in vivo: low doses are safe but mostly inefficient, whereas higher doses become rapidly unsafe; and (b) requires a sustained expression in vivo of at least about four weeks to achieve stable vessels that persist after cessation of the angiogenic stimulus. Here we will review the current understanding of how VEGF induces the growth of normal or pathological blood vessels, what limitations for the controlled induction of safe and efficient angiogenesis are intrinsically linked to the biological properties of VEGF, and how this knowledge can guide the design of more effective strategies for therapeutic angiogenesis."
30685385,"With the changed therapeutic armamentarium for Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), biomarkers predicting treatment response are urgently needed. We studied whole blood and mucosal expression of genes previously reported to predict outcome to anti-TNF therapy, and investigated if the signature was specific for anti-TNF agents."
30685352,"Intellectual disability is the most limiting hallmark of Down syndrome, for which there is no gold-standard clinical treatment yet. The endocannabinoid system is a widespread neuromodulatory system involved in multiple functions including learning and memory processes. Alterations of this system contribute to the pathogenesis of several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the involvement of the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of Down syndrome has not been explored before. We used the best-characterized preclinical model of Down syndrome, the segmentally trisomic Ts65Dn model. In male Ts65Dn mice, cannabinoid type-1 receptor (CB1R) expression was enhanced and its function increased in hippocampal excitatory terminals. Knockdown of CB1R in the hippocampus of male Ts65Dn mice restored hippocampal-dependent memory. Concomitant with this result, pharmacological inhibition of CB1R restored memory deficits, hippocampal synaptic plasticity and adult neurogenesis in the subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus. Notably, the blockade of CB1R also normalized hippocampal-dependent memory in female Ts65Dn mice. To further investigate the mechanisms involved, we used a second transgenic mouse model overexpressing a single gene candidate for Down syndrome cognitive phenotypes, the dual specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A (DYRK1A). CB1R pharmacological blockade similarly improved cognitive performance, synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in transgenic male Dyrk1A mice. Our results identify CB1R as a novel druggable target potentially relevant for the improvement of cognitive deficits associated with Down syndrome."
30685341,"Although surgical techniques and adjuvant therapies have undergone progressive development for decades, the therapeutic outcomes for treating glioblastoma (GBM) remain poor. The main reasons for the poor prognosis of gliomas are that limited tumor tissue that can be resected (to preserve brain functions) and that residual tumors are often resistant to irradiation and chemotherapy. Therefore, overcoming the resistance of residual tumors against adjuvant therapy is urgently needed for glioma treatment. Recent large cohort studies of genetic alterations in GBM demonstrated that both genetic information and intracellular molecular signaling are networked in gliomas and that such information may help clarify which molecules or signals serve essential roles in resistance against radiation or chemotherapy, highlighting them as potential novel therapeutic targets against refractory gliomas. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of molecular networks that govern glioma biology, mainly based on cohort studies or recent evidence, with a focus on how intracellular signaling molecules in gliomas associate with each other and regulate refractoriness against current therapy."
30685241,"Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by photosensitivity and by hematologic abnormalities in affected individuals. CEP is caused by mutations in the uroporphyrinogen synthase (UROS) gene. In three reported cases, CEP has been associated with a specific X-linked GATA1 mutation. Disease-causing mutations in either gene result in absent or markedly reduced UROS enzymatic activity. This in turn leads to the accumulation of the non-physiologic and photoreactive porphyrinogens, uroporphyrinogen I and coproporphyrinogen I, which damage erythrocytes and elicit a phototoxic reaction upon light exposure. The clinical spectrum of CEP depends on the level of residual UROS activity, which is determined by the underlying pathogenic loss-of-function UROS mutations. Disease severity ranges from non-immune hydrops fetalis in utero to late-onset disease with only mild cutaneous involvement. The clinical characteristics of CEP include exquisite photosensitivity to visible light resulting in bullous vesicular lesions which, when infected lead to progressive photomutilation of sun-exposed areas such as the face and hands. In addition, patients have erythrodontia (brownish discoloration of teeth) and can develop corneal scarring. Chronic transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia is common and leads to bone marrow hyperplasia, which further increases porphyrin production. Management of CEP consists of strict avoidance of exposure to visible light with sun-protective clothing, sunglasses, and car and home window filters. Adequate care of ruptured vesicles and use of topical antibiotics is indicated to prevent superinfections and osteolysis. In patients with symptomatic hemolytic anemia, frequent erythrocyte cell transfusions may be necessary to suppress hematopoiesis and decrease marrow production of the phototoxic porphyrins. In severe transfection-dependent cases, bone marrow or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been performed, which is curative. Therapeutic approaches including gene therapy, proteasome inhibition, and pharmacologic chaperones are under investigation."
30685233,"Lipoprotein glomerulopathy (LPG) is a rare autosomal dominant renal disease with incomplete penetrance, associated with specific protein-modifying mutations in the APOE gene. LPG is associated with poor renal prognosis, in which lipoprotein thrombi are seen in the glomerular capillaries. Dyslipidemia in LPG generally resembles type III hyperlipoproteinemia with elevated serum apolipoprotein E level. Fibrate is the most frequently reported lipid-lowering therapy in LPG as hypertriglyceridemia is common in these individuals. There are few existing case reports on effectiveness of statin monotherapy for LPG. We report a 32-year-old Chinese man who presented with nephrotic syndrome, renal impairment, severe hypercholesterolemia without hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension. Renal biopsy confirmed lipoprotein glomerulopathy. Genetic testing confirmed APOE Kyoto mutation. Anti-hypertensive therapy, including angiotensin receptor blocker, and statin were initiated. Concomitant with normalization of lipid profile, his proteinuria markedly improved, and his renal function has remained stable up to 3 years, demonstrating sustained benefit with statin monotherapy in LPG."
30684706,"Machine learning (ML) is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) giving computer systems the ability to learn data, without being explicitly programmed.

30684673,"Studies have shown that hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) (the most important types of liver cancer) is the fifth most common cancer, and the third cause of mortality, globally. Although major progress has been made in the treatment and diagnosis of this disease, its eradication remains limited. Consequently, discovering new diagnosis and treatment methods is important. Cancer nanotechnology is an emerging field in medicine with the aim to accomplish advances in both cancer diagnosis and treatment. Gold nanoparticles (GNPs/ AuNPs) have attracted much attention, owing to their biocompatibility (bio-inertness, and low cytotoxicity), ability to chemically modify their surface by attaching multiple types of ligands, and their superior optical properties. This review will focus on the current applications of AuNPs in different aspects, such as imaging, drug and gene delivery, radiotherapy, and photothermal therapy of liver cancer treatment."

30684656,"Understanding and predicting inter-individual differences related to the success of drug therapy is of tremendous importance, both during drug development and for clinical applications. Importantly, while seminal twin studies indicate that the majority of inter-individual differences in drug disposition are driven by hereditary factors, common genetic polymorphisms explain only less than half of this genetically encoded variability. Recent progress in Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has for the first time allowed to comprehensively map the genetic landscape of human pharmacogenes. Importantly, these projects have unveiled vast numbers of rare genetic variants, which are estimated to contribute substantially to the missing heritability of drug metabolism phenotypes. However, functional interpretation of these rare variants remains challenging and constitutes one of the important frontiers of contemporary pharmacogenomics. Furthermore, NGS technologies face challenges in the interrogation of genes residing in complex genomic regions, such as CYP2D6 and HLA genes. We here provide an update of the implementation of pharmacogenomic variations in the clinical setting and present emerging strategies that facilitate the translation of NGS data into clinically useful information. Importantly, we anticipate that these developments will soon result in a paradigm shift of pre-emptive genotyping away from the interrogation to candidate variants and towards the comprehensive profiling of an individuals genotype, thus allowing for a true individualization of patient drug treatment regimens."
30684591,"Cancer is a genetic disease stemming from cumulative genetic/epigenetic aberrations. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas9-mediated genome editing technology has been extensively applied in various cell types and organisms, both in vitro and in vivo, for efficient gene disruption and gene modification. CRISPR-Cas9 has shown great promise for the treatment of cancer. However, despite its advantages and tremendous potential, numerous challenges, such as fitness of edited cells, editing efficiency, delivery methods and potential off-target effects, remain to be solved for completely clinical application. Here, we present the potential applications and recent advances of CRISPR-Cas9 in cancer therapy, and discuss the challenges that might be encountered in clinical applications."
30684558,"MHC class I loss due to the abnormality of β2-microgloburin (B2M) gene is one of the mechanism underlying delayed relapses in melanoma patients long after the initial positive responses to anti-PD-1 therapy. However, the tumor-specific reactivity of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in tumor lesions that lost MHC class I expression has not been well evaluated. We report the case of a 55-year-old woman with two metastatic melanoma lesions. After a 12-month period of successful tumor suppression by anti-PD-1 antibody therapy, one lesion started to grow again. We resected both lesions and examined the tumor cells and TILs. The shrinking lesion consisted of necrotic tissue and macrophages, and the enlarged lesion consisted of both necrotic tissue and viable tumor cells. The tumor cells completely lost MHC class I expression, but it was restored upon retroviral transduction of the normal B2M gene. When we checked the tumor-specific reactivity of TILs derived from the relapsing lesion, we found that these TILs failed to recognize the native tumor cells derived from the lesion, but strongly recognized the MHC-class-I-recovered cells by B2M transduction. Our report emphasizes the limitations of T-cell-based immunotherapy and highlights the importance of developing alternative strategies for such cases."
30684555,"Mutations in the gene encoding collagen VII (C7) cause the devastating blistering disease recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). RDEB is characterized by severe skin fragility and non-healing wounds aggravated by scarring and fibrosis. We previously demonstrated that thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is increased in RDEB fibroblasts. Because transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ) signaling is also increased in RDEB, and TSP1 is known to activate TGFβ, we investigated the role of TSP1 in TGFβ signaling in RDEB patient cells. Knock-down of TSP1 reduced phosphorylation of smad3 (a downstream target of TGFβ signaling) in RDEB primary fibroblasts, while over-expression of C7 reduced phosphorylation of smad3. Furthermore, inhibition of TSP1 binding to the latency-associated protein (LAP)/TGFβ complex decreased fibrosis in engineered extracellular matrix formed by RDEB fibroblasts, as evaluated by picrosirius red staining and analyses of birefringent collagen fibrillar deposits. We demonstrate that C7 binds TSP1, which could potentially limit TSP1-LAP association and subsequent TGFβ activation. Our study suggests a previously unreported mechanism for increased TGFβ signaling in the absence of C7 in RDEB patient skin. Moreover, these data identify TSP1 as a possible target for reducing fibrosis in the tumor-promoting dermal microenvironment of RDEB patients."
30684518,"Microbial analyzes of carious dentine samples, especially in terms of interventions, represent a challenge due to difficulties in carious dentine sampling particularly with small bacterial DNA contents. Therefore, information about the quantitative reduction of bacterial DNA as well as microbial shifts and differences in diversity correlating with treatment interventions are scarce. In this study, carious dentine samples were collected in a first step in the course of a selective caries excavation at two different deep dentine caries lesions in three patients. Second, after selective caries excavation and sampling of carious dentine, an intervention was performed by applying dental materials onto the remaining carious dentine followed by a restoration of the study teeth with composite fillings. After 8 weeks, remaining carious dentine was sampled and analyzed as described above. The microbial community before and after therapy was analyzed by conventional culture compared to bacterial DNA analyses using 16S rRNA gene based real-time PCR and terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) for fingerprinting community changes within carious dentine samples. An ultra-pure workflow allowed the valid comparison of even small carious dentine samples with low DNA contents and the differentiation between intact cell-derived and cell-free bacterial DNA. Intra- and inter-subject related differences in the bacterial DNA content and its composition in deep dentine caries were determined considering the first visits. The ratio of cell-free bacterial DNA and DNA from intact cells decreased in two of three subjects included in the current study from visit 1 to visit 2 with the test substance (1:200 to 1:17) and the control substance (1:82 to 1:7). T-RFLP revealed changes in the bacterial diversity and composition shifts after treatment as well as between cell-free bacterial DNA and DNA derived from intact cells. The approach of differentiation and quantification of cell-free and intact cell-derived bacterial DNA is reasonable within the investigation of carious dentine samples, especially when considering the effect of an intervention. T-RFLP is principally suitable for the analysis of microbial shifts within carious dentine samples."
30684280,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) shows several kinds of disorders, which acutely harm the kidney. However, the current medical methods have limited therapeutic effects. The present study aimed to find out the molecular mechanism of AKI pathogenesis, which may provide new insights for future therapy."
30684217,"NR4A2 is a nuclear receptor and a transcription factor, with distinctive physiological features. In the cell nuclei of the central nervous system, it is widely expressed and identified as a crucial regulator of dopaminergic (DA) neuronal differentiation, survival, and maintenance. Importantly, it has regulated different genes crucial for dopaminergic signals, and its expression has been diminished in both aged and PD post-mortem brains and reduced in PD patients. In microglia and astrocytes, the expression of NR4A2 has been found where it can be capable of inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory mediators; hence, it protected inflammation-mediated DA neuronal death. In addition, NR4A2 plays neuroprotective role via regulating different signals. However, NR4A2 has been mainly focused on Parkinson's research, but, in recent times, it has been studied in Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), and stroke. Altered expression of NR4A2 is connected to AD progression, and activation of its may improve cognitive function. It is downregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of MS patients; nonetheless, its role in MS has not been fully clear. miR-145-5p known as a putative regulator of NR4A2 and in a middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion model, anti-miR-145-5p administration promoted neurological outcomes in rat. To date, various activators and modulators of NR4A2 have been discovered and investigated as probable therapeutic drugs in neuroinflammatory and neuronal cell death models. The NR4A2 gene and cell-based therapy are described as promising drug candidates for neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, microRNA might have a crucial role in neurodegeneration via affecting NR4A2 expression. Herein, we present the role of NR4A2 in neuroinflammation and neuronal cell death focusing on neurodegenerative conditions and display NR4A2 as a promising therapeutic target for the therapy of neuroprotection."
30684132,"Identification of new drug and cell therapy targets for disease treatment will be facilitated by a detailed molecular understanding of normal and disease development. Human pluripotent stem cells can provide a large in vitro source of human cell types and, in a growing number of instances, also three-dimensional multicellular tissues called organoids. The application of stem cell technology to discovery and development of new therapies will be aided by detailed molecular characterisation of cell identity, cell signalling pathways and target gene networks. Big data or 'omics' techniques-particularly transcriptomics and proteomics-facilitate cell and tissue characterisation using thousands to tens-of-thousands of genes or proteins. These gene and protein profiles are analysed using existing and/or emergent bioinformatics methods, including a growing number of methods that compare sample profiles against compendia of reference samples. This review assesses how compendium-based analyses can aid the application of stem cell technology for new therapy development. This includes via robust definition of differentiated stem cell identity, as well as elucidation of complex signalling pathways and target gene networks involved in normal and diseased states."

30683933,"Coronary microembolization (CME) is a common complication seen during primary percutaneous coronary intervention (pPCI). CME-induced myocardiac inflammation is the primary cause of myocardiac injury. Dysregulated miR-142-3p has been implicated in multiple cardiovascular diseases and is significantly downregulated in CME-induced myocardial injury. However, the role of miR-142-3p in CME-induced myocardial injury is unclear. This study herein built a porcine CME model by infusing microembolization spheres into the left anterior descending branch via a microcatheter, and detected the downregulation of miR-142-3p in the myocardial tissues of CME pigs. Echocardiography, hematoxylin basic fuchsin picric acid (HBFP) staining, and western blotting of NF-κB p65, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 showed that the pharmacological overexpression of miR-142-3p using agomiR has improved cardiac function and attenuated CME-induced myocardiac inflammatory response, while its inhibition using antagomiR demonstrated inverse effects. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated IRAK-1 as a direct target gene of miR-142-3p. Luciferase reporter assays, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting demonstrated its effects in controlling the inflammation of cardiomyocytes. It is noteworthy that miR-142-3p was found to be decreased in the plasma of STEMI patients undergoing pPCI with no-reflow, indicating a potential clinical relevance of miR-142-3p. The receiver-operator characteristic curve indicated that plasma miR-142-3p might be an independent predictor of no-reflow during pPCI in patients with STEMI. Therefore, overexpression of miR-142-3p acts as a novel therapy for CME-induced myocardial injury."
30683895,"Tumor heterogeneity, within and between tumors, may have severe implications for tumor therapy, especially for targeted gene therapy, where single-targeted approaches often result in limited efficacy and therapy resistance. Polymer-formulated nonviral vectors provide a potent delivery platform for cancer therapy. To improve applicability for future clinical use in a broad range of patients and cancer types, a dual-targeting approach was performed. Synthetic LPEI-PEG<sub>2kDa</sub>-based polymer backbones were coupled to two tumor-specific peptide ligands GE11 (EGFR-targeting) and cMBP (cMET-targeting). The dual-targeting approach was used to deliver the theranostic sodium iodide symporter (NIS) gene to hepatocellular cancer. NIS as auspicious theranostic gene allows noninvasive imaging of functional NIS gene expression and effective anticancer radioiodide therapy. Enhanced tumor-specific transduction efficiency of dual-targeted polyplexes compared to single-targeted polyplexes was demonstrated in vitro using tumor cell lines with different EGFR and cMET expression and in vivo by <sup>124</sup>I-PET-imaging. Therapeutic efficacy of the bispecific concept was mirrored by significantly reduced tumor growth and perfusion, which was associated with prolonged animal survival. In conclusion, the dual-targeting approach highlights the benefits of a bifunctional strategy for a future clinical translation of the bioimaging-based NIS-mediated radiotherapy allowing efficient targeting of heterogeneic tumors with variable receptor expression levels."
30683875,"Adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been successfully used to deliver gene therapy to improve auditory function in mouse models of hereditary hearing loss. Many forms of hereditary hearing loss have mutations which affect the cochlear hair cells, the mechanosensory cells which allow for sound detection and processing. While most conventional AAVs infect inner hair cells (IHCs) with various efficiencies, they infect outer hair cells (OHCs) and supporting cells at lower levels in the cochlea. Here we examine the infection patterns of two synthetic AAVs (AAV2.7m8 and AAV8BP2) in the mouse inner ear. AAV2.7m8 infects both IHCs and OHCs with high efficiency. In addition, AAV2.7m8 infects inner pillar cells and inner phalangeal cells with high efficiency. Our results suggest that AAV2.7m8 is an excellent viral vector for inner ear gene therapy targeting cochlear hair cells and supporting cells, and it will likely greatly expand the potential applications for inner ear gene therapy."
30683865,"RNA-guided nucleases of the CRISPR/Cas type can be repurposed as programmable nucleotide deaminases to mediate targeted nucleotide substitutions. Such base editors have enormous potential in genome editing, gene therapy and precision breeding. However, current editors suffer from limited specificity in that they edit different and/or multiple bases within a larger sequence window. Using cytidine deaminase base editors that elicit C-to-T mutations, we show here that high editing precision can be achieved by engineering the connection between the deaminase domain and the Cas domain of the editor. By systematically testing different linker sequences and removing non-essential sequences from the deaminase, we obtain high-precision base editors with narrow activity windows that can selectively edit a single cytidine at a specific position with high accuracy and efficiency. These base editors will enable the use of genome editing in applications where single-nucleotide changes are required and off-target editing of adjacent nucleotides is not tolerable."
30683859,"MicroRNA deregulation is a consistent feature of glioblastoma, yet the biological effect of each single gene is generally modest, and therapeutically negligible. Here we describe a module of microRNAs, constituted by miR-124, miR-128 and miR-137, which are co-expressed during neuronal differentiation and simultaneously lost in gliomagenesis. Each one of these miRs targets several transcriptional regulators, including the oncogenic chromatin repressors EZH2, BMI1 and LSD1, which are functionally interdependent and involved in glioblastoma recurrence after therapeutic chemoradiation. Synchronizing the expression of these three microRNAs in a gene therapy approach displays significant anticancer synergism, abrogates this epigenetic-mediated, multi-protein tumor survival mechanism and results in a 5-fold increase in survival when combined with chemotherapy in murine glioblastoma models. These transgenic microRNA clusters display intercellular propagation in vivo, via extracellular vesicles, extending their biological effect throughout the whole tumor.

In the ensuing 6.5 years, 3 252 156 infants in the state had DNA from dried blood spots assayed for T-cell receptor excision circles (TRECs). Abnormal TREC results were followed-up with liquid blood testing for T-cell abnormalities. We report the performance of the SCID screening program and the outcomes of infants who were identified."
30683676,"Primary genetic mitochondrial diseases are often difficult to diagnose, and the term 'possible' mitochondrial disease is used frequently by clinicians when such a diagnosis is suspected. There are now many known phenocopies of mitochondrial disease. Advances in genomic testing have shown that some patients with a clinical phenotype and biochemical abnormalities suggesting mitochondrial disease may have other genetic disorders. In instances when a genetic diagnosis cannot be confirmed, a diagnosis of 'possible' mitochondrial disease may result in harm to patients and their families, creating anxiety, delaying appropriate diagnosis and leading to inappropriate management or care. A categorisation of <i>'diagnosis uncertain'</i>, together with a specific description of the metabolic or genetic abnormalities identified, is preferred when a mitochondrial disease cannot be genetically confirmed."
30683673,"Abnormalities of tooth number in humans, such as agenesis and supernumerary tooth formation, are closely related to diphyodont development. There is an increasing demand to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind diphyodont development through the use of large animal models, since they are the most similar to the mechanism of human tooth development. However, attempting to study diphyodont development in large animals remains challenging due to large tooth size, prolonged growth stage and embryo manipulation. Here, we characterized the expression of possible genes for diphyodont development and odontogenesis of an organoid bud from single cells of tooth germs <i>in vitro</i> using <i>Wzhishan pig</i> strain (<i>WZSP</i>). Following this, we used a method of ectopic transplantation of tooth germs at cap stage to dynamically track diphyodont development of tooth germs in mouse subrenal capsules to overcome the restrictions in pig embryos. The results showed that pig tooth germ at cap stage could restore diphyodont development and maintain efficient long-term survival and growth in mouse subrenal capsules, which is suitable for future manipulation of large mammalian tooth development. Our pilot study provided an alternative for studying diphyodont development in large mammals, which will further promote the use of pig as a diphyodont model similar to humans for craniofacial development study."
30683655,"Thrombopoietin (Thpo)/Mpl signaling controls hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) self-renewal and quiescence, however, how these two seemingly opposing functions are controlled is not well understood. By transplantation of lentiviral transduced hematopoietic cells in the Mpl-deficient mouse model we addressed whether known or predicted Thpo target genes were able to rescue the Mpl-deficient phenotype of the mice. Among the tested genes we identified endothelial protein C receptor (Epcr) to expand HSC with long-term (LT)-HSC surface phenotype in Mpl-/- mice and to enable secondary transplantation of Mpl-deficient BM. Epcr-transduced Mpl-/- HSC enter quiescence earlier after transplantation than control transduced Mpl-/- cells and upregulated expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-xL. Also in the wildtype background, Epcr expression marked the engrafting population in the BM. Furthermore, Epcr expression in Mpl-/- hematopoiesis increased the number of megakaryocytes in the BM. In vitro Thpo supported the surface expression of Epcr on primary murine hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells. With these data we add new insights into Thpo-dependent influence on HSC engraftment after transplantation. This may be of use for the in vitro manipulation of HSC, also in the context of gene therapy."

30683556,"Seizures are a feature not only of the many forms of epilepsy, but also of global metabolic diseases such as mitochondrial encephalomyopathy (ME) and glycolytic enzymopathy (GE). Modern anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are successful in many cases, but some patients are refractory to existing AEDs, which has led to a surge in interest in clinically managed dietary therapy such as the ketogenic diet (KD). This high-fat, low-carbohydrate diet causes a cellular switch from glycolysis to fatty acid oxidation and ketone body generation, with a wide array of downstream effects at the genetic, protein, and metabolite level that may mediate seizure protection. We have recently shown that a Drosophila model of human ME (ATP6<sup>1</sup>) responds robustly to the KD; here, we have investigated the mechanistic importance of the major metabolic consequences of the KD in the context of this bioenergetics disease: ketogenesis, reduction of glycolysis, and anaplerosis. We have found that reduction of glycolysis does not confer seizure protection, but that dietary supplementation with ketone bodies or the anaplerotic lipid triheptanoin, which directly replenishes the citric acid cycle, can mimic the success of the ketogenic diet even in the presence of standard carbohydrate levels. We have also shown that the proper functioning of the citric acid cycle is crucial to the success of the KD in the context of ME. Furthermore, our data reveal that multiple seizure models, in addition to ATP6<sup>1</sup>, are treatable with the ketogenic diet. Importantly, one of these mutants is TPI<sup>sugarkill</sup>, which models human glycolytic enzymopathy, an incurable metabolic disorder with severe neurological consequences. Overall, these studies reveal widespread success of the KD in Drosophila, further cementing its status as an excellent model for studies of KD treatment and mechanism, and reveal key insights into the therapeutic potential of dietary therapy against neuronal hyperexcitability in epilepsy and metabolic disease."
30683453,"As more antibiotics are rendered ineffective by drug-resistant bacteria, focus must be shifted towards alternative therapies for treating infections. Although several alternatives already exist in nature, the challenge is to implement them in clinical use. Advancements within biotechnology, genetic engineering, and synthetic chemistry have opened up new avenues towards the search for therapies that can substitute for antibiotics. This review provides an introduction to the various promising approaches that have been adopted in this regard. Whilst the use of bacteriophages and antibodies has been partly implemented, other promising strategies, such as probiotics, lysins, and antimicrobial peptides, are in various stages of development. Propitious concepts such as genetically modified phages, antibacterial oligonucleotides, and CRISPR-Cas9 are also discussed."
30683142,"BRCA1-mutated cancers exhibit deficient homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair, resulting in extensive copy number alterations and genome instability. HR deficiency can also arise in tumors without a BRCA1 mutation. Compared with other breast tumors, HR-deficient, BRCA1-like tumors exhibit worse prognosis but selective chemotherapeutic sensitivity. Presently, patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) who do not respond to hormone endocrine-targeting therapy are given cytotoxic chemotherapy. However, more recent evidence showed a similar genomic profile between BRCA1-deficient TNBCs and hormone-receptor-positive tumors. Characterization of the somatic alterations of BRCA1-like hormone-receptor-positive breast tumors as a group, which is currently lacking, can potentially help develop biomarkers for identifying additional patients who might respond to chemotherapy."

30682568,"X-linked Hypophosphatemia (XLH) is caused by loss of function mutations in the PHEX gene. Given the recent availability of a new therapy for XLH, a retrospective analysis of the most recent 261 Chinese patients with XLH evaluated at Peking Union Medical College Hospital was conducted. Clinical, biochemical, radiographic studies, as well as genetic analyses, including Sanger sequencing for point mutations and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to detect large deletions/duplications were employed. Based on the structure of Neprilysin (NEP), a member of M13 family that includes PHEX, a three-dimensional (3D) model of PHEX was constructed, missense and nonsense mutations were positioned on the predicted structure to visualize relative positions of these two types of variants. Sex differences and genotype-phenotype correlations were also undertaken. Genetic analyses identified 166 PHEX mutations in 261 XLH patients. One hundred and eleven of the 166 mutations were unreported. Four mutational 'hot-spots' were identified in this cohort (P534L, G579R, R747X, c.1645+1 G>A). Missense mutations, but not nonsense mutations, clustered in the two putative lobes of the PHEX protein, suggesting these are functionally important regions of the molecule. Circulating levels of intact FGF23 were significantly elevated (median level 101.9 pg/mL; reference range 16.1-42.2 pg/mL). No significant sex differences, as well as no phenotypic differences were identified between patients with putative truncating and non-truncating PHEX mutations. However, patients with N-terminal PHEX mutations had an earlier age of onset of disease (P = 0.015) and higher iFGF23 levels (P = 0.045) as compared to those with C-terminal mutations. These data provide a comprehensive characterization of the largest cohort of patients with XLH reported to date from China, which will help in evaluating the applicability of emerging therapies for this disease in this ethnic group."
30682496,"Primary coenzyme Q10 deficiency-6 (COQ10D6) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by COQ6 mutations. The main clinical manifestations are infantile progressive nephrotic syndrome (NS) leading to end-stage renal disease and sensorineural deafness. A 7-year-old girl was diagnosed with steroid-resistant NS (SRNS) and an audiological work-up revealed bilateral sensorineural deafness. A renal biopsy demonstrated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Despite immunosuppressive therapy, her serum levels of creatinine increased and haemodialysis was indicated within 1 year after the diagnosis. Living-donor kidney transplantation was performed in the eighth month of haemodialysis. A diagnostic custom-designed panel-gene test including 30 genes for NS revealed homozygous c.1058C > A [rs397514479] in exon nine of COQ6. Her older brother, who had sensorineural hearing loss with no renal or neurological involvement, had the same mutation in homozygous form. COQ6 mutations should be considered not only in patients with SRNS with sensorineural hearing loss but also in patients with isolated sensorineural hearing loss with a family history of NS. The reported p.His174 variant of COQ8B was suggested to be a risk factor for secondary CoQ deficiency, while p.Arg174 appeared to improve the condition in a yeast model. Family segregation and the co-occurrence of biallelic p.Arg174 of COQ8B in a brother with hearing loss implied that the interaction of the altered COQ8B with the mutant COQ6 alleviated the symptoms in this family. CoQ10 replacement therapy should be initiated for these patients, as primary CoQ10 deficiency is considered the only known treatable mitochondrial disease."

30682183,"The onset age of physiological puberty is greatly variable. This variability has been attributed to environmental factors and to genetic factors although a very little is explained by genome-wide associations studies. Previously, we reported the existence of an association between the onset age of puberty and final height. It is known that final height is associated with parental height (specifically, with the ""target height""). We hypothesized that the variability of the onset age of puberty contributes to the attainment of a final height which is similar to the target height. We hypothesized that whenever a child's height-percentile differs from the target height percentile (we called this difference the ""height gap""), the onset of puberty is advanced or delayed so that they are closer or even equal at the end of pubertal growth. The association between height gap and onset age of puberty was investigated in the reported study."

30681750,"Understanding the mechanisms that promote the specification of pancreas progenitors and regulate their self-renewal and differentiation will help to maintain and expand pancreas progenitor cells derived from human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells. This will improve the efficiency of current differentiation protocols of hPS cells into β cells and bring such cells closer to clinical applications for the therapy of diabetes. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1b1 (Aldh1b1) is a mitochondrial enzyme expressed specifically in progenitor cells during mouse pancreas development and we have shown that its functional inactivation leads to accelerated differentiation and deficient β cells. In this report, we aimed to identify small molecules inducers of Aldh1b1 expression taking advantage of a mouse embryonic stem (mES) cell Aldh1b1 lacZ reporter line and a pancreas differentiation protocol directing mES cells into pancreatic progenitors. We identified AMI-5, a protein methyltransferase inhibitor, as an Aldh1b1 inducer and showed that it can maintain Aldh1b1 expression in embryonic pancreas explants. This led to a selective reduction in endocrine specification. This effect was due to a downregulation of Ngn3 and it was mediated through Aldh1b1 since the effect was abolished in Aldh1b1 null pancreata. The findings implicated methyltransferase activity in the regulation of endocrine differentiation and showed that methyltransferases can act through specific regulators during pancreas differentiation. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Recent advances in the directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells into ß like cells have brought the prospect of diabetes cell therapy using this approach closer. However, the very large number of endocrine cells required for a single infusion to diabetic patients remains as a key challenge. Expansion of intermediate pancreas progenitors would address this issue. We have found that protein methyltransferase activity promotes endocrine specification through the dowregulation of Aldh1b1, a gene implicated in the maintenance of pancreatic progenitors and necessary for ß cell functionality in the mouse. These findings suggest that specific, reversible protein methyltransferase inhibitors may delay differentiation of pancreas progenitors. © AlphaMed Press 2019."
30681718,"Novel therapies in development have brought a new focus on pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD), the most common congenital haemolytic anaemia due to a glycolytic enzyme deficiency. With an improved recognition of its clinical presentation and understanding of the diagnostic pathway, more patients are likely to be identified with this anaemia. Complications, including gallstones and non-transfusion-related iron overload, require monitoring for early diagnosis and management. Current management remains supportive with red cell transfusions, chelation and splenectomy. Decisions to transfuse and/or splenectomise must be individualised. Haematopoietic stem cell transplant has been pursued in a small number of patients with mixed outcomes. Novel treatment approaches, which range from a small molecule pyruvate kinase activator to gene therapy, may transform the way in which PKD is managed in the future. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiology of PKD and present our approaches to diagnosis, monitoring and management of patients with this anaemia."

30681373,"Mutations of the FLT3 gene are among most common genetic abnormalities occurring in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are associated with dismal prognosis. Tremendous effort has been devoted to developing clinically effective FLT3 inhibitors. First generation inhibitors consisted of multi-kinase inhibitors (sorafenib, lestaurtinib, midostaurin), which blocked FLT3 as well as multiple other kinase receptors. The failure of these agents to induce durable responses led to the development of second generation FLT3 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (quizartinib, crenolinib, gilteritinib) exhibiting high potency and specificity for mutant FLT3 kinases and sustained in vivo FLT3 inhibition. These myriad FLT3 inhibitors possess diverse kinase inhibitory properties, toxicity profiles, and pharmacokinetics, which impact on their incorporation into therapeutic regimens. Areas covered: This article reviews the medical literature on current and future FLT3 inhibitors for AML therapy. We provide algorithms for which kinase inhibitor should be utilized for different FLT3 mutations (ITD±TKD) and clinical scenarios (de novo, relapsed/refractory, fit vs. unfit) and discuss novel FLT3 targeted therapeutic approaches. Expert Commentary: Integration of clinically active FLT3 inhibitors into all stages of therapy for all individuals with FLT3 mutant AML promises to significantly improve outcomes for this poor prognosis disease."
30681371,"The last few years have witnessed what can certainly be defined as a ""period of renaissance"" for immunotherapy in the field of hematological malignancies. In particular, antibody-mediated and cell-mediated immunotherapy have significantly changed the treatment approach of patients with B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. These therapies, initially employed in patients with refractory/relapsed disease, are now integrated in the treatment of newly diagnosed patients. Together with the therapeutic success, we have also learnt that these innovative therapies can induce relevant, sometimes life-threatening or even fatal, side effects. Areas covered: In this review article, we analyzed the applicative therapeutic scenario and the peculiar toxicities associated with approaches of immunotherapy, paying particular attention to the new emerging side effects, substantially unknown before the introduction of these therapies. Expert commentary: Both monoclonal antibodies and cell therapy with lymphocytes genetically modified to be redirected against leukemia targets through the transduction with chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) have obtained unprecedented success in rescuing patients with resistant B-cell malignancies. Complications, such as neurotoxicity, cytokine release syndrome or persistent B-cell lymphopenia, must always be taken into consideration and diagnosed in a timely manner in patients with B-cell neoplasms to guarantee optimal management, thus avoiding they blunting the efficacy of immunotherapy."
30681250,"Recently, branched and dendrimeric cationic peptides have shown increasing transfection efﬁciency compared to linear peptides owing to their superior capacity for DNA condensation. Herein, we design and synthesize two analogously guanidinocarbonylpyrrole (GCP)-substituted branched cationic tripeptides, which provide extremely strong electrostatic attraction with plasmid DNA. Both ligands 1 and 2 can bind to plasmid DNA and form condensed complexes owing to the branched structure and high positive charges, as demonstrated by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), Zeta-potential and atomic-force microscopy (AFM). Compared with ligand 1, after the replacement of the carboxylate group by an amide group, binding of ligand 2 to DNA shows exothermic enthalpy and positive entropy changes. Rationally, ligand 2 can translocate plasmid pF143 to HEK 293T cells, showing high gene transfection efficiency. Therefore, the branched cationic peptides could serve as powerful tools for gene delivery and have great potential for gene silencing and gene therapy."
30681027,"Recent studies have indicated that circular RNAs (circRNAs) are involved in a variety of human diseases. However, the roles of circRNAs in traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) remain unknown. Here, we performed RNA-seq to analyze the circRNA expression profile in rat spinal cord after SCI and investigate the relevant mechanisms. In all, 150 circRNAs were significantly differentially expressed in rat spinal cord after SCI by a fold-change ≥2 and p-value ≤0.05. Among these, 99 circRNAs were up-regulated, while 51 were down-regulated. Gene ontology, KEGG pathway analyses and circRNA/miRNA interaction networks were conducted to predict the potential roles of circRNAs in the process of SCI. In addition, the expression levels of six selected circRNAs were successfully verified by qRT-PCR. Further study identified circRNA_07079 and circRNA_01282 as being associated with SCI and they may participate in the pathophysiology of SCI through circRNA-targeted miRNA-mRNA axis. In summary, the results of our study revealed the expression profiles and potential functions of differentially-expressed circRNAs in traumatic spinal cord injury in rats; this may provide new clues for studying the mechanisms underlying SCI, and also present novel molecular targets for clinical therapy of SCI."
30680957,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are proven to be beneficial in islet transplantation, suggesting a potential therapeutic role of them in total pancreatectomy with islet autotransplantation (TP-IAT) for chronic pancreatitis (CP) patients. We investigated whether MSCs derived from CP patients are suitable for use in autologous cell therapy. MSCs from healthy donors (H-MSCs) and CP patients (CP-MSCs) were studied for phenotype, colony formation potential, multilineage differentiation ability, proliferation, senescence, secretory characters, and immunosuppressive functions. The potential protective effect of CP-MSCs was evaluated on hypoxia-induced islet cell death. Cell surface markers were similar between H-MSCs and CP-MSCs, as well as the ability of colony formation, multilineage differentiation, secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and transforming growth factor (TGF-β), senescence and inhibition of T cells proliferation in vitro. We found that growth differentiation factor 6 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) were significantly downregulated, whereas TGFβ and matrix metalloproteinase-2 were significantly upregulated in CP-MSCs compared with H-MSCs, among 84 MSC-related genes investigated in this study. MSCs from CP patients secreted less HGF, compared with the H-MSCs. A higher interferon-γ-induced indoleamine 2, 3-dioxygenase expression was observed in CP-MSCs compared to H-MSCs. Moreover, CP-MSCs prevented hypoxia-induced β cell deaths to a similar extend as H-MSCs. Regardless of moderate difference in gene expression, CP-MSCs possess similar immunomodulatory and prosurvival functions to H-MSCs, and may be suitable for autologous cell therapy in CP patients undergoing TP-IAT.

30680915,"Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration (IDD) is the main cause of low back pain in the clinic. In the advanced stage of IDD, both cell transplantation and gene therapy have obvious limitations. At this stage, tissue-engineered IVDs (TE-IVDs) provide new hope for the treatment of this disease. We aimed to construct a TE-IVD with a relatively complete structure. The inner annulus fibrosus (AF) was constructed using poly (butylene succinate-co-terephthalate) copolyester (PBST) electrospun fibers, and the outer AF consisted of solid PBST. The nucleus pulposus (NP) scaffold was constructed using a chitosan hydrogel, as reported in our previous research. The three components were assembled in vitro, and the mechanical properties were analyzed. AF and NP cells were implanted on the corresponding scaffolds. Then, the cell-seeded scaffolds were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice and cultured for 4 weeks; then they were removed and implanted into New Zealand white rabbits. After 4 weeks, their properties were analyzed. The PBST outer AF provided mechanical support for the whole TE-IVD. The electrospun film and chitosan hydrogel simulated the natural structure of the IVD well. Its mechanical property could meet the requirement of the normal IVD. Four weeks later, X-ray and MR imaging examination results suggested that the height of the intervertebral space was retained. The cells on the TE-IVD expressed extracellular matrix, which indicated that the cells maintained their biological function. Therefore, we conclude that the whole TE-IVD has biological and biomechanical properties to some extent, which is a promising candidate for IVD replacement therapies. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

30680866,"Transgender individuals comprise a growing patient population in genetic counseling practice. The identification of a pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene may impact a transgender person's decisions regarding hormonal and/or surgical transition. Limited scientific literature exists on specific genetic counseling needs and medical management strategies for transgender individuals. In addition, most genetic counselors have had limited experience and training in conducting genetic counseling sessions with transgender patients. In this report, we describe three cases of transgender individuals who underwent genetic counseling and testing in our clinic. All were at ≥50% risk to carry a familial BRCA1 pathogenic variant. Case 1 is a 20-year-old transgender female initiating hormonal agents. Case 2 is a 19-year-old transgender male considering surgical decisions who has a BRCA1 pathogenic variant on both sides of the family. Case 3 is a 24-year-old transgender male who had previously undergone gender-affirming mastectomy (top surgery) and is taking androgen therapy. Unique aspects of genetic testing, psychosocial counseling, and medical management of transgender individuals have arisen in the course of their care. In this report, we discuss our experiences and practices of case preparation, case management, appropriate genetic testing, and medical management such as screening, surgical decisions, and coordination of care. There is a need for more research in this area and more transgender-specific training for genetic counselors."

30680745,"Riboflavin (vitamin B2), a water-soluble vitamin, is an essential nutrient in higher organisms as it is not endogenously synthesized, with requirements being met principally by dietary intake. Tissue-specific transporter proteins direct riboflavin to the intracellular machinery responsible for the biosynthesis of the flavocoenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). These flavocoenzymes play a vital role in ensuring the functionality of a multitude of flavoproteins involved in bioenergetics, redox homeostasis, DNA repair, chromatin remodelling, protein folding, apoptosis and other physiologically relevant processes. Hence, it is not surprising that the impairment of flavin homeostasis in humans may lead to multisystem dysfunction including neuromuscular disorders, anaemia, abnormal fetal development and cardiovascular disease. In this review we provide an overview of riboflavin absorption, transport, and metabolism. We then focus on the clinical and biochemical features associated with biallelic FLAD1 mutations leading to FAD synthase deficiency, the only known primary defect in flavocoenzyme synthesis, in addition to providing an overview of clinical disorders associated with nutritional deficiency of riboflavin and primary defects of riboflavin transport. Finally, we give a brief overview of disorders of the cellular flavoproteome. Because riboflavin therapy may be beneficial in a number of primary or secondary disorders of the cellular flavoproteome, early recognition and prompt management of these disorders is imperative.

30680670,"A 67-year-old female was referred to our hospital with a sternal fracture in March 2008. She received a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (MM) BJP-κ type (ISS stage III). G-banding karyotype revealed 46, XX, t(11;22)(q23.3;q11.2) (Hubacek, Gene 592:193-9, 2016), which was later confirmed to be congenital. After repeated rounds of chemotherapy with bortezomib and lenalidomide, she obtained a very good partial response in August 2014, and she was followed up with no treatment. However, she relapsed in February 2016. At that time, fluorescence in situ hybridization identified del(13q) and t(4;14)(p16;q32), which are associated with a poor prognosis. Furthermore, PCR analysis showed that the chromosome 11 breakpoint was at the APOA5/APOA4 locus at 11q23.3, which is associated with malignancy, and that the chromosome 22 breakpoint was at the SEPT5 intron 1 locus, which also plays a role in leukemogenesis through formation of a fusion gene with MLL. Although she was treated with three further lines of therapy, she died from disease progression in August 2017. Synergism between t(11;22) and t(4;14) may have induced the double-refractory phenotype to proteasome inhibitor and lenalidomide, at least during the chemorefractory phase. We present a biological analysis of this case and a review of the literature."
30680569,"Kidney transplant recipients are at risk for infections due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Polymyxin-resistant CRE (PR-CRE) infections are especially difficult to treat. The aim of this study was to characterize PR-CRE infections among kidney transplant recipients and identify risk factors for treatment failure. This retrospective cohort study involved all kidney transplant recipients with PR-CRE infection between 2013 and 2017 at our center. Minimal inhibitory concentrations for polymyxin B were determined by broth microdilution. Carbapenem-resistant genes (bla<sub>KPC</sub>, bla<sub>NDM</sub>, and bla<sub>OXA-48</sub>), aminoglycoside-resistance genes, and polymyxin-resistant gene mcr-1 were identified by polymerase chain reaction. All but one of the 47PR-CRE infections identified were due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most common type of infection (in 54.3%) was urinary tract infection (UTI). Monotherapy was used in 10 cases. Combined treatment regimens included double-carbapenem therapy in 19 cases, oral fosfomycin in 19, and amikacin in 13. Treatment failure occurred in 21 cases (45.7%). Clinical success was achieved 78.9% of patients who used aminoglycosides versus 37.0% of those who not used this drug (p = 0.007). Multivariate analysis showed diabetes mellitus to be a risk factor for treatment failure; amikacin use and UTI were found to be protective. Nine strains were RmtB producers. Although aminoglycosides constitute an important therapeutic option for PR-CRE infection, the emergence of aminoglycoside resistance could have a major impact on the management of CRE infection."
30680511,"Oxidative stress is believed to be of great importance for both the etiology and the persistence of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). The aim of this study was to investigate the association of -262C/T polymorphism of the catalase (CAT) gene with JIA, as well as to evaluate whether this polymorphism can influence plasma CAT activity and outcome in JIA patients treated with etanercept. A total of 154 subjects (60 JIA patients and 94 healthy volunteers) were screened for CAT-262C/T gene polymorphism using the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Plasma CAT activity was determined using the spectrophotometric method according to Goth, prior to and 12 months after anti-TNF (etanercept) therapy. Clinical outcome was assessed using the JIA ACR (American College of Rheumatology) response criteria. The genotype and allele frequency distributions of CAT-262C/T polymorphism in the patients were significantly different from those of the controls (p = 0.014, p = 0.006). The TT genotype (polymorphic homozygous) was associated with a 4.36-fold higher likelihood of having JIA (95% CI 1.545-12.323, p = 0.005) as compared to the CC genotype (wild-type). At month 12 of treatment, JIA patients, carriers of the CC genotype, showed significantly higher plasma CAT activity (p = 0.004) and achieved the JIA ACR 70 response more often (p = 0.003) than the patients, carriers of the CT/TT genotype. This is the first study implying the possible association of CAT-262C/T polymorphism with JIA. The results suggest the potential protective effect of the CC genotype, with regard to CAT activity and treatment outcome."

At the age of 3 years he was diagnosed with a high-risk metastatic medulloblastoma. The patient died only 11 months after diagnosis of a fulminant relapse presenting as meningeal and spinal dissemination. Whole-exome sequencing of germline DNA was employed to detect the underlying mutation for this putative cancer syndrome presenting with the combination of medulloblastoma and skin alterations. After screening all possible homozygous gene SNVs, we identified a mutation of SON, an essential protein in cell cycle regulation and cell proliferation, as the most likely genetic cause."
30680249,"Cells naturally sense and actively response to their environment. Cell-therapy has long been studied and shown therapeutic effects in various diseases. However, several hurdles should be overcome to improve cell-based therapy. Gene delivery-mediated cellular modification has shown improvement of cell function by obstacle gene silencing and therapeutic gene expression. Especially, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing is a very promising method for gene modification. In this review, we describe the recent advances in genetic modification for cell therapy. Stem cells are still promising source of cell therapy due to their self-renewal character and differentiation potential. Immune cells regulate the inflammatory response and immunization, which inspired various cell therapy using immune-regulatory cells. Conclusively, we emphasize the need to develop gene-modification-based cell therapy as potent future treatment."
30680063,"Recent studies revealed that several Long noncoding RNAs (LncRNAs) are associated with progression of gastric cancer (GC), while the functional role and molecular mechanism of many GC-associated lncRNAs remain undetermined. The tumor suppressor-gene retinoblastoma gene (RB1) was decreased in several human cancers including gastric cancer (GC). In this study, we investigated whether Linc00441 was involved in the suppression of RB1. Our findings showed that the up-regulated Linc00441 was inversely correlated with RB1 expression in human GC tumor samples. The gain- and loss-of-function investigation revealed that Linc00441 could promote the proliferation of GC cells. Furthermore, RNA pull down and RIP assays demonstrated that Linc00441 could recruit DNMT1 to the RB1 promoter and suppressed RB1 expression in GC cells. In conclusion, our findings revealed that Linc00441 played crucial role in GC progression and suggested that Linc00441 was potentially an effective target for GC therapy in the future."

30679899,Photostimulation using low-power laser had been used for nervous repair with interesting results. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of 20 mW low-power He-Ne laser on the regeneration of a peripheral sciatic nerve after trauma using the Albino rabbit as an animal model for experimental treatment.
30679641,"Vertebrate fetuins are multi-domain plasma-proteins of the cystatin-superfamily. Human fetuin-A is also known as AHSG, α<sub>2</sub>-Heremans-Schmid-glycoprotein. Gene-knockout in mice identified fetuin-A as essential for calcified-matrix-metabolism and bone-mineralization. Fetuin-B deficient mice, on the other hand, are female infertile due to zona pellucida 'hardening' caused by the metalloproteinase ovastacin in unfertilized oocytes. In wildtype mice fetuin-B inhibits the activity of ovastacin thus maintaining oocytes fertilizable. Here we asked, if fetuins affect further proteases as might be expected from their evolutionary relation to single-domain-cystatins, known as proteinase-inhibitors. We show that fetuin-A is not an inhibitor of any tested protease. In stark contrast, the closely related fetuin-B selectively inhibits astacin-metalloproteinases such as meprins and ovastacin, but not astacins of the tolloid-subfamily, nor any other proteinase. The analysis of fetuin-B expressed in various mammalian cell types, insect cells, and truncated fish-fetuin expressed in bacteria, showed that the cystatin-like domains alone are necessary and sufficient for inhibition. This report highlights fetuin-B as a specific antagonist of ovastacin and meprin-metalloproteinases. Control of ovastacin was shown to be indispensable for female fertility. Meprin inhibition, on the other hand, renders fetuin-B a potential key-player in proteolytic networks controlling angiogenesis, immune-defense, extracellular-matrix-assembly and general cell-signaling, with implications for inflammation, fibrosis, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer."
30679632,"Exposure to nicotine during pregnancy through maternal smoking or nicotine replacement therapy is associated with adverse birth outcomes as well as several cognitive and neurobehavioral deficits. Several studies have shown that nicotine produces long-lasting effects on gene expression within many brain regions, including the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which is the origin of dopaminergic neurons and the dopamine reward pathway. Using a well-established rat model for perinatal nicotine exposure, we sought to investigate altered biological pathways using mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of dopaminergic (DA) and non-dopaminergic (non-DA) neurons in this highly-valuable area. Putative miRNA-gene target interactions were assessed as well as miRNA-pathway interactions. Our results indicate that extracellular matrix (ECM) receptor interactions were significantly altered in DA and non-DA neurons due to chronic nicotine exposure during pregnancy. They also show that the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was enriched in DA neurons with multiple significant miRNA-gene targets, but the same changes were not seen in non-DA neurons. We speculate that nicotine exposure during pregnancy could differentially affect the gene expression of DA and non-DA neurons in the VTA."
30679540,"Breast cancer brain metastasis (BCBM) remains a major clinical problem. Approximately 10-16% of patients with breast cancer develop brain metastases (BCBM). However, no systemic therapy has gained regulatory approval for the specific treatment of BCBM and this remains an area of persistent, unmet medical need. Rapid, predictive and clinically-relevant animal models are critical to study the biology of brain metastases and to identify effective therapeutic approaches for patients with BCBM. Here, we describe a method for efficient establishment of orthotopic mouse models of patient-derived brain metastases via an improved intracarotid injection protocol that permits tumor cell growth in the unique brain microenvironment without compromising the blood-brain barrier (BBB). We demonstrate that our newly improved models of patient-derived brain metastases recapitulate the histologic, molecular, and genetic characteristics of their matched patient tumor specimens and thus represent a potentially powerful tool for pre-clinical and translational research."
30679441,"Preclinical studies demonstrated that radiation up-regulates PD-L1 expression in tumor cells, providing a rationale for combining PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors with radiation. However this has not been validated in patients with non-small cell lung cancer due to the difficulty to obtain serial biopsies. Measuring PD-L1 expression in circulating tumor cells (CTCs), may allow real-time monitoring of immune activation in tumor. In this study, whole blood from non-metastatic NSCLC patients was collected before, during, and after radiation or chemoradiation using a microfluidic chip. PD-L1 expression in CTCs was assessed by immunofluorescence and qPCR and monitored through the course of treatment. Overall, PD-L1(+) CTCs were detected in 25 out of 38 samples (69.4%) with an average of 4.5 cells/ml. After initiation of radiation therapy, the proportion of PD-L1(+) CTCs increased significantly (median 0.7% vs. 24.7%, P < 0.01), indicating up-regulation of PD-L1 in tumor cells in response to radiation. In addition, patients positive for PD-L1 (≥5% of CTCs positive for PD-L1) at baseline had shorter PFS. Gene expression analysis revealed that higher levels of PD-L1 were associated with poor prognosis. Therefore, CTCs can be used to monitor dynamic changes of PD-L1 during radiation therapy which is potentially prognostic of response to treatment."
30679434,"Activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress/the unfolded protein response (UPR) has been linked to cancer, but the molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and there is a paucity of reagents to translate this for cancer therapy. Here, we report that an IRE1α RNase-specific inhibitor, MKC8866, strongly inhibits prostate cancer (PCa) tumor growth as monotherapy in multiple preclinical models in mice and shows synergistic antitumor effects with current PCa drugs. Interestingly, global transcriptomic analysis reveal that IRE1α-XBP1s pathway activity is required for c-MYC signaling, one of the most highly activated oncogenic pathways in PCa. XBP1s is necessary for optimal c-MYC mRNA and protein expression, establishing, for the first time, a direct link between UPR and oncogene activation. In addition, an XBP1-specific gene expression signature is strongly associated with PCa prognosis. Our data establish IRE1α-XBP1s signaling as a central pathway in PCa and indicate that its targeting may offer novel treatment strategies."
30679319,"With the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and precision medicine, investigators have determined that tumors from different tissue sources that have the same types of genetic mutations will have a positive response to the same targeted therapy. This finding has prompted us to seek potential therapeutic targets for patients with carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) using NGS technology. Here, we reported a case of a woman with CUP resistance to chemotherapy. We detected 450 cancer-related gene alterations using three metastatic tumor specimens and found the presence of <i>EML4</i> exon13 and <i>ALK</i> exon20 fusion. The tumor did respond to crizotinib, a first-generation <i>ALK</i> inhibitor. When her tumor progressed, circulating tumor DNA detection revealed <i>ALK</i> L1196 M and G1269A mutation resistance to crizotinib, but she had a response to brigatinib. This case revealed that NGS technology used to detect the genetic alterations in patients with CUP might be a reliable method to find potential therapeutic targets, although the primary lesion could not always be confirmed. KEY POINTS: This case exemplifies responsiveness to <i>ALK</i> inhibitor in carcinoma of unknown primary (CUP) with <i>EML4-ALK</i> fusion.Next-generation sequencing is an important diagnostic tool to find potential therapeutic targets in CUP.Liquid biopsy may be useful to provide critical information about resistance mechanisms in CUP to guide sequential treatment decision with targeted therapy."
30679201,"The p53 gene is the most commonly mutated gene in solid tumors but leveraging p53 status in therapy remains a challenge. Previously, we determined that p53 deficiency sensitizes head and neck cancer cells to AZD1775, a WEE1 kinase inhibitor, and translated our findings into a Phase I clinical trial. Here we investigate how p53 affects cellular responses to AZD1775 at the molecular level. We found that p53 modulates both replication stress and mitotic deregulation triggered by WEE1 inhibition. Without p53, slowing of replication forks due to replication stress is exacerbated. Abnormal, γH2AX-positive mitoses become more common and can proceed with damaged or under-replicated DNA. p53-deficient cells fail to properly recover from WEE1 inhibition and exhibit fewer 53BP1 nuclear bodies despite evidence of unresolved damage. A faulty G1/S checkpoint propagates this damage into the next division. Together, these deficiencies can intensify damages in each consecutive cell cycle in the drug. Implications: The data encourage the use of AZD1775 in combination with genotoxic modalities against p53-deficient HNSCC."
30679159,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents the poorest prognosis among all of breast cancer subtypes with no currently available effective therapy. In this study, we hypothesized that sulforaphane (SFN), a dietary component abundant in broccoli and its sprouts, can inhibit malignant cell proliferation and tumor sphere formation of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) in TNBC. CSC population was isolated using fluorescently activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis with the combined stem cell surface markers, CD44+/CD24-/CD49f+. The effect of SFN on a stem-related embryonic oncogene CRIPTO-1/TDGF1 (CR1) was evaluated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In vivo, BalbC/nude mice were supplemented with SFN before and after TNBC cell inoculation (daily i.p. injection of 50mg SFN/kg for 5 and 3 weeks respectively), and effects of SFN during mammary tumor initiation and growth were accessed with Nanostring gene analysis. We found that SFN can inhibit cell proliferation and mammosphere formation of CSCs in TNBC. Further analysis of gene expression in these TNBC tumor cells revealed that SFN significantly decreases the expression of cancer-specific CR1, CRIPTO-3/TDGF1P3 (CR3, a homologue of CR1), and various stem cell markers including Nanog, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1A1 (ALDH1A1), Wnt3, and Notch4. Our results suggest that SFN may control the malignant proliferation of CSCs in TNBC via Cripto-mediated pathway by either suppressing its expression and/or by inhibiting Cripto/Alk4 protein complex formation. Thus, the use of SFN for chemoprevention of TNBC is plausible and warrants further clinical evaluation."
30678901,"BRM270 is the most leading phytochemical extract that possesses potent anticancer properties. A major challenge associated with this drug is its low bioavailability and thus requires high dosages for cancer treatment. Here, we report the novel nano-synthesis of phyto-composite, BRM270 for the first time by mechanical milling method with specific modifications for enhanced cytotoxicity against HepG2 human hepatoma cancer cells. Unlike free BRM270 and other phytomedicines, BRM270 nanoparticles (BRM270 NPs) are well-dispersed and small sized (23 to 70 nm) which is believed to greatly enhanced cellular uptake. Furthermore, the acidic tumor microenvironment attracts BRM270 NPs enhancing targeted therapy while leaving normal cells less affected. The comparative cytotoxicity analysis using MTT assay among the three treatment groups, such as free BRM270, BRM270 NPs, and doxorubicin demonstrated that BRM270 NPs induced greater cytotoxicity against HepG2 cells with an effective drug concentration of 12 μg/ml. From FACS analysis, we observed an apoptotic cell death of 44.4% at BRM270 NPs treated cells while only 12.5% found in the free BRM270 treated cells. Further, the comparative relative expression profiling of the candidate genes were showed significant (p < 0.05) down-regulation of IL6, BCL2, p53, and MMP9 in the BRM270 NPs treated cells, compared to the free BRM270 and doxorubicin. Indeed, the genes, CASPASE 9 and BAX have shown significant (p < 0.05) upregulation in cells treated with BRM270 NPs as compared to counter treatment groups. The investigation of the signal pathways and protein-protein network associations were also carried out to elucidate the functional insights underlying anti-cancer potential of BRM270 NPs in HepG2 cells. Taken together, our findings demonstrated that these uniquely engineered BRM270 NPs effectively enter into the cancer cells due to its acidic microenvironment thereby inducing apoptosis and regulate the cell-proliferation in-vitro at extremely low dosages."
30678831,"Previously, we proposed 12 marker genes (Aen, Bax, Btg2, Ccnf, Ccng1, Cdkn1a, Gdf15, Lrp1, Mbd1, Phlda3, Plk2 and Tubb4b) to discriminate mouse genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (GTHC) from non-genotoxic hepatocarcinogens (NGTHC). This was determined by qPCR and principal component analysis (PCA), as the aim of an in vivo short-term screening for genotoxic hepatocarcinogens. For this paper, we conducted an application study of the 12 mouse marker genes to rat data, Open TG-GATEs (public data). We analyzed five typical rat GTHC (2-acetamodofluorene, aflatoxin B1, 2-nitrofluorene, N-nitrosodiethylamine and N-nitrosomorpholine), and not only seven typical rat NGTHC (clofibrate, ethanol, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, hexachlorobenzene, phenobarbital and WY-14643) but also 11 non-genotoxic non-hepatocarcinogens (NGTNHC; allyl alcohol, aspirin, caffeine, chlorpheniramine, chlorpropamide, dexamethasone, diazepam, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, theophylline and tolbutamide) from Open TG-GATEs. The analysis was performed at 3, 6, 9 and 24 h after a single administration and 4, 8, 15 and 29 days after repeated administrations. We transferred Open TG-GATEs DNA microarray data into log<sub>2</sub> data using the ""R Project for Statistical Computing"". GTHC-specific dose-dependent gene expression changes were observed and significance assessed with the Williams test. Similar significant changes were observed during 3-24 h and 4-29 days, assessed with Welch's t-test, except not for NGTHC or NGTNHC. Significant differential changes in gene expression were observed between GTHC and NGTHC in 11 genes (except not Tubb4b) and between GTHC and NGTNHC in all 12 genes at 24 h and 10 genes (except Ccnf and Mbd1) at 29 days, per Tukey's test. PCA successfully discriminated GTHC from NGTHC and NGTNHC at 24 h and 29 days. The results demonstrate that 12 previously proposed mouse marker genes are useful for discriminating rat GTHC from NGTHC and NGTNHC from Open TG-GATEs."
30678730,"Nanosecond pulsed electric fields (nsPEFs) can produce more significant biological effects than traditional electric fields and have thus attracted rising attention in developing medical applications based on short pulse duration and high field strength, such as effective cancer therapy. However, little is known about their effects on the differentiation of stem cells. Furthermore, mechanisms of electric fields on chondrogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) remain elusive, and effects of electric fields on cartilage regeneration need to be verified in vivo. Here, we aimed to study the effects of nsPEFs on chondrogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro and in vivo and further to explore the mechanisms behind the phenomenon."

30678647,"Due to the lack of effective therapies and poor prognosis in TNBC (triple-negative breast cancer) patients, there is a strong need to develop effective novel targeted therapies for this subtype of breast cancer. Inhibition of heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), a conserved molecular chaperone that is involved in the regulation of oncogenic client proteins, has shown to be a promising therapeutic approach for TNBC. However, both intrinsic and acquired resistance to HSP90 inhibitors (HSP90i) limits their effectiveness in cancer patients."
30678630,"Functional foods, neutraceuticals and natural antioxidants have established their potential roles in the protection of human health and diseases. Thymoquinone (TQ), the main bioactive component of Nigella sativa seeds (black cumin seeds), a plant derived neutraceutical was used by ancient Egyptians because of their ability to cure a variety of health conditions and used as a dietary food supplement. Owing to its multi targeting nature, TQ interferes with a wide range of tumorigenic processes and counteracts carcinogenesis, malignant growth, invasion, migration, and angiogenesis. Additionally, TQ can specifically sensitize tumor cells towards conventional cancer treatments (e.g., radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and immunotherapy) and simultaneously minimize therapy-associated toxic effects in normal cells besides being cost effective and safe. TQ was found to play a protective role when given along with chemotherapeutic agents to normal cells. In the present study, reverse in silico docking approach was used to search for potential molecular targets for cancer therapy. Various apoptotic targets and DNA repair target were docked with the ligand, TQ. TQ was also tested for its anticancer activities for its ability to cause cell death, arrest cell cycle, DNA damage and ability to inhibit PARP gene expression. In silico docking studies showed that TQ effectively docked apoptotic targets including Trail-R, Bcl-2, MDM2, Bak, Bax and DNA repair target PARP. The docking was more effective with PARP. They were able to bring about cell death mediated by apoptosis, cell cycle arrest in the late apoptotic stage and induce DNA damage too . TQ effectively down regulated PARP gene expression which can lead to enhanced cancer cell death. Thus TQ is a good candidate that can be exploited as a novel neutraceutical for combinatorial therapy to treat breast cancer."
30678511,"Overexpression of human trophoblast cell surface antigen 2 (Trop2) has been observed in many cancers; however, its roles in proliferation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remain unclear. Thus, this study aimed to characterize the function of Trop2 in HCC."
30678445,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Although the cause of UC is postulated to be multifactorial in nature, including genetic predisposition, epithelial barrier defects, dysregulation of immune responses, and environmental factors, the specific pathogenesis of UC is still incompletely understood. In the treatment of UC so far, a method of suppressing immunity and treating it has been mainstream. Immunosuppressant drugs, including thiopurines (azathioprine or 6-mercaptopurine), anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (anti-TNF-α) antibody (infliximab and adalimumab), and calcineurin inhibitor, can be used in treat patients with corticosteroid-dependent and/or corticosteroid-refractory moderateto- severe UC. Recently, in addition to such a conventional therapeutic agent, golimumab, which is the first transgenic human monoclonal anti-TNF-α antibody to be fabricated, anti α-4/β-7 integrin antibody, and Janus kinase inhibitor have been reported to novel immunosuppressant therapy. Furthermore, other treatments with unique mechanisms different from immunosuppression, have also been suggested, including fecal microbiota transplantation and Indigo naturalis, which is a Chinese herbal medicine. We compared the features and efficacy of these new treatments. In this issue, the features and treatment options for these new treatments is reviewed."
30678435,"Introduction: One of the major challenges in cancer treatment is the lack of specific and accurate treatment in
cancer. Data analysis can help to understand the underlying molecular mechanism that leads to better treatment.
Increasing availability and reliability of DNA microarray data leads to increase the use of these data in a variety of
cancers. This study aimed at applying and evaluating microarray data analyzing, identification of important pathways
and gene network for medulloblastoma patients to improve treatment approaches especially target therapy. Methods:
In the current study, Microarray gene expression data (GSE50161) were extracted from Geo datasets and then analyzed
by the affylmGUI package to predict and investigate upregulated and downregulated genes in medulloblastoma. Then,
the important pathways were determined by using software and gene enrichment analyses. Pathways visualization
and network analyses were performed by Cytoscape. Results: A total number of 249 differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) were identified in medulloblastoma compared to normal samples. Cell cycle, p53, and FoxO signaling pathways
were indicated in medulloblastoma, and CDK1, CCNB1, CDK2, and WEE1 were identified as some of the important
genes in the medulloblastoma. Conclusion: Identification of critical and specific pathway in any disease, in our case
medulloblastoma, can lead us to better clinical management and accurate treatment and target therapy."
30678417,"<b>Objective:</b> Adenosquamous carcinoma of lung is an uncommon subtype with more aggressive behavior and poor prognosis than adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. This study was aimed to investigate the clinicopathological characteristics and prognostic factors of lung adenosquamous carcinoma. <b>Methods:</b> The pathological features and follow-up data of 133 patients were collected and the prognostic factors of these patients were retrospectively analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the 133 patients, 81 cases (60.9%) smoked. Among the 62 patients whose percentage of histological components were identified, 45 cases had >50% adenocarcinoma components, and 17 cases had >50% squamous cell carcinoma components. 55 patients had lymph node metastasis at the first visit. All patients accepted at least one test of tumor driven gene mutation, and the results showed that the mutation rate of EGFR was 50.8% (67/132), the mutation rate of K-ras was 8.6% (11/128), the ALK-positive rate was 4.2% (2/48). The gender, smoking status, and the proportion of pathological components were the main influence factors of EGFR mutation status. The median overall survival was 28 months, the rates of 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival were 72.9%, 23.3%, and 9.0%, respectively. EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) treatment was an independent risk factor for prognose of these patients (<i>P</i>=0.024). <b>Conclusions:</b> Lung adenosquamous carcinoma is a rare subtype with high malignancy and poor prognosis. Early diagnosis and driven-mutation-based individualized therapy may improve the survival of patients with lung adenosquamous carcinoma."
30678377,"The therapeutic potential of phages has been considered since their first identification more than a century ago. The evident concept of using a natural predator to treat bacterial infections has, however, since then been challenged considerably. Initially, the vast success of antibiotics almost eliminated the study of phages for therapy. Upon the renaissance of phage therapy research, the most provocative and unique properties of phages such as high specificity, self-replication and co-evolution prohibited a rapid preclinical and clinical development. On the one hand, the typical trajectory followed by small molecule antibiotics could not be simply translated into the preclinical analysis of phages, exemplified by the need for complex broad spectrum or personalized phage cocktails of high purity and the more complex pharmacokinetics. On the other hand, there was no fitting regulatory framework to deal with flexible and sustainable phage therapy approaches, including the setup and approval of adequate clinical trials. While significant advances are incrementally made to eliminate these hurdles, phage-inspired antibacterials have progressed in the slipstream of phage therapy, benefiting from the lack of hurdles that are typically associated with phage therapy. Most advanced are phage lytic enzymes that kill bacteria through peptidoglycan degradation and osmotic lysis. Both phages and their lytic enzymes are now widely considered as safe and have now progressed to clinical phase II to show clinical efficacy as pharmaceutical. Yet, more initiatives are needed to fill the clinical pipeline to beat the typical attrition rates of clinical evaluation and to come to a true evaluation of phages and phage lytic enzymes in the clinic."
30678296,"Cationic niosomes have become important non-viral vehicles for transporting a good number of small drug molecules and macromolecules. Growing interest shown by these colloidal nanoparticles in therapy is determined by their structural similarities to liposomes. Cationic niosomes are usually obtained from the self-assembly of non-ionic surfactant molecules. This process can be governed not only by the nature of such surfactants but also by others factors like the presence of additives, formulation preparation and properties of the encapsulated hydrophobic or hydrophilic molecules. This review is aimed at providing recent information for using cationic niosomes for gene delivery purposes with particular emphasis on improving the transportation of antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), small interference RNAs (siRNAs), aptamers and plasmids (pDNA)."
30678262,"Glaucoma is a multifactorial disease in which pro-apoptotic signals are directed to retinal ganglion cells. During this disease the conventional outflow pathway becomes malfunctioning. Aqueous humour builds up in the anterior chamber, leading to increased intraocular pressure. Both of these events are related to functional impairment. The knowledge of molecular mechanisms allows us to better understand the usefulness of substances that can support anti-glaucoma therapy. The goal of glaucoma therapy is not simply to lower intraocular pressure; it should also be to facilitate the survival of retinal ganglion cells, as these constitute the real target tissue in this disease, in which the visual pathway is progressively compromised. Indeed, an endothelial dysfunction syndrome affecting the endothelial cells of the trabecular meshwork occurs in both normal-tension glaucoma and high-tension glaucoma. Some substances, such as polyunsaturated fatty acids, can counteract the damage due to the molecular mechanisms - whether ischemic, oxidative, inflammatory or other - that underlie the pathogenesis of glaucoma. In this review, we consider some molecules, such as polyphenols, that can contribute, not only theoretically, to neuroprotection but which are also able to counteract the metabolic pathways that lead to glaucomatous damage. Ginkgo biloba extract, for instance, improves the blood supply to peripheral districts, including the optic nerve and retina and exerts a neuro-protective action by inhibiting apoptosis. Polyunsaturated fatty acids can protect the endothelium and polyphenols exert an anti-inflammatory action through the down-regulation of cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-6. All these substances can aid anti-glaucoma therapy by providing metabolic support for the cells involved in glaucomatous injury. Indeed, it is known that the food we eat is able to change our gene expression."
30678080,"Adverse experiences and chronic stress are well-known risk factors for the development of major depression, and an impaired stress response regulation is frequently observed in acute depression. Impaired glucocorticoid receptor (GR) signalling plays an important role in these alterations, and a restoration of GR signalling appears to be a prerequisite of successful antidepressant treatment. Variants in genes of the stress response regulation contribute to the vulnerability to depression in traumatized subjects. Consistent findings point to an important role of FKBP5, the gene expressing FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51), which is a strong inhibitor of the GR, and thus, an important regulator of the stress response. We investigated the role of FKBP5 and FKB51 expression with respect to stress response regulation and antidepressant treatment outcome in depressed patients. This study included 297 inpatients, who participated in the Munich Antidepressant Response Signature (MARS) project and were treated for acute depression. In this open-label study, patients received antidepressant treatment according to the attending doctor's choice. In addition to the <i>FKBP5</i> genotype, changes in blood FKBP51 expression during antidepressant treatment were analyzed using RT-PCR and ZeptoMARK<sup>TM</sup> reverse phase protein microarray (RPPM). Stress response regulation was evaluated in a subgroup of patients using the combined dexamethasone (dex)/corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) test. As expected, increased FKBP51 expression was associated with an impaired stress response regulation at baseline and after six weeks was accompanied by an elevated cortisol response to the combined dex/CRH test. Further, we demonstrated an active involvement of FKBP51 in antidepressant treatment outcome. While patients responding to antidepressant treatment had a pronounced reduction of <i>FKBP5</i> gene and FKBP51 protein expression, increasing expression levels were observed in nonresponders. This effect was moderated by the genotype of the <i>FKBP5</i> single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1360780, with carriers of the minor allele showing the most pronounced association. Our findings demonstrate that <i>FKBP5</i> and, specifically, its expression product FKBP51 are important modulators of antidepressant treatment outcome, pointing to a new, promising target for future antidepressant drug development."
30678040,"Fibroblast growth factor 14 (FGF14) is a member of the intracellular FGFs, which is a group of proteins involved in neuronal ion channel regulation and synaptic transmission. We previously demonstrated that male <i>Fgf14</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice recapitulate the salient endophenotypes of synaptic dysfunction and behaviors that are associated with schizophrenia (SZ). As the underlying etiology of SZ and its sex-specific onset remain elusive, the <i>Fgf14</i><sup>-/-</sup> model may provide a valuable tool to interrogate pathways related to disease mechanisms. Here, we performed label-free quantitative proteomics to identify enriched pathways in both male and female hippocampi from <i>Fgf14</i><sup>+/+</sup> and <i>Fgf14</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice. We discovered that all of the differentially expressed proteins measured in <i>Fgf14</i><sup>-/-</sup> animals, relative to their same-sex wildtype counterparts, are associated with SZ based on genome-wide association data. In addition, measured changes in the proteome were predominantly sex-specific, with the male <i>Fgf14</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice distinctly enriched for pathways associated with neuropsychiatric disorders. In the male Fgf14<sup>-/-</sup> mouse, we found molecular characteristics that, in part, may explain a previously described neurotransmission and behavioral phenotype. This includes decreased levels of ALDH1A1 and protein kinase A (PRKAR2B). ALDH1A1 has been shown to mediate an alternative pathway for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) synthesis, while PRKAR2B is essential for dopamine 2 receptor signaling, which is the basis of current antipsychotics. Collectively, our results provide new insights in the role of FGF14 and support the use of the <i>Fgf14</i><sup>-/-</sup> mouse as a useful preclinical model of SZ for generating hypotheses on disease mechanisms, sex-specific manifestation, and therapy."
30677516,"Despite recent advances in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, the available options are still limited and associated with some complications. Induction of biological pacemakers via Tbx18 gene insertion in the heart tissue has been suggested as a promising therapeutic strategy for cardiac arrhythmia. Following a previous in vitro study reporting the production of Tbx18-expressing human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPS-CMs), we aimed to investigate the efficacy of these engineered cells to generate pacemaker rhythms in a murine model of complete heart block. We also attempted to generate a functional pacemaker by Tbx18 overexpression in native cardiac cells of rat heart. The hiPSC-derived pacemaker cells were produced by lentiviral delivery of Tbx18 gene to stem cells during a small molecule-based differentiation process. In the present study, 16 male albino Wistar rats were randomly assigned to Tbx18-lentivirus (n = 4) and Tbx18-pacemaker cells (n = 4) administered via injection into the left ventricular anterolateral wall. The control rats received GFP-lentiviruses (n = 4) and GFP-pacemaker cells (n = 4). Fourteen days after the injection, the rats were sacrificed and analyzed by electrocardiography (ECG) recording using a Langendorff-perfused heart model following complete heart block induced by hypokalemia and crashing. Immunofluorescence staining was used to investigate the expression of Tbx18, HCN4 and connexin 43 (Cx43) proteins in Tbx18-delivered cells of heart tissues. The heart rate was significantly reduced after complete heart block in all of the experimental rats (P < 0.05). Heart beating in the Tbx18-transduced hearts was slower compared with rats receiving Tbx18-pacemaker cells (P = 0.04). The duration of ventricular fibrillation (VF) was higher in the lentiviral Tbx18 group compared with the GFP-injected controls (P = 0.02) and the Tbx18-pacemaker cell group (P = 0.02). The ECG recording data showed spontaneous pacemaker rhythms in both intervention groups with signal propagation in Tbx18-transduced ventricles. Immunostaining results confirmed the overexpression of HCN4 and downregulation of Cx43 as a result of the expression of the Tbx18 gene and spontaneously contracting myocyte formation. We confirmed the formation of a functional pacemaker after introduction of Tbx18 via cell and gene therapy strategies. Although the pacemaker activity was better in gene-received hearts since there were longer VF duration and signal propagation from the injection site, more data should be gathered from the long-term activity of such pacemakers in different hosts."
30677474,"The number of individuals affected by acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is constantly rising. In light of the limited availability of treatment options and their relative inefficacy, cell based therapeutic modalities have been studied. However, not many efforts are put into safety evaluation of such applications. The aim of this study was to review the existing published literature on adverse events reported in studies with genetically modified cells for treatment of kidney disease. A systematic review was conducted by searching PubMed and EMBASE for relevant articles published until June 2018. The search results were screened and relevant articles selected using pre-defined criteria, by two researchers independently. After initial screening of 6894 abstracts, a total number of 97 preclinical studies was finally included for full assessment. Of these, 61 (63%) presented an inappropriate study design for the evaluation of safety parameters. Only 4 studies (4%) had the optimal study design, while 32 (33%) showed sub-optimal study design with either direct or indirect evidence of adverse events. The high heterogeneity of studies included regarding cell type and number, genetic modification, administration route, and kidney disease model applied, combined with the consistent lack of appropriate control groups, makes a reliable safety evaluation of kidney cell-based therapies impossible. Only a limited number of relevant studies included looked into essential safety-related outcomes, such as inflammatory (48%), tumorigenic and teratogenic potential (12%), cell biodistribution (82%), microbiological safety with respect to microorganism contamination and latent viruses' reactivation (1%), as well as overall well-being and animal survival (19%). In conclusion, for benign cell-based therapies, well-designed pre-clinical studies, including all control groups required and good manufacturing processes securing safety, need to be done early in development. Preferably, this should be performed side by side with efficacy evaluation and according to the official guidelines of leading health organizations."
30677473,"Individuals differ substantially in their response to pharmacological treatment. Personalized medicine aspires to embrace these inter-individual differences and customize therapy by taking a wealth of patient-specific data into account. Pharmacogenomic constitutes a cornerstone of personalized medicine that provides therapeutic guidance based on the genomic profile of a given patient. Pharmacogenomics already has applications in the clinics, particularly in oncology, whereas future development in this area is needed in order to establish pharmacogenomic biomarkers as useful clinical tools. In this review we present an updated overview of current and emerging pharmacogenomic biomarkers in different therapeutic areas and critically discuss their potential to transform clinical care. Furthermore, we discuss opportunities of technological, methodological and institutional advances to improve biomarker discovery. We also summarize recent progress in our understanding of epigenetic effects on drug disposition and response, including a discussion of the only few pharmacogenomic biomarkers implemented into routine care. We anticipate, in part due to exciting rapid developments in Next Generation Sequencing technologies, machine learning methods and national biobanks, that the field will make great advances in the upcoming years towards unlocking the full potential of genomic data."
30677283,"The diarrheagenic bacteria coli take a significant place among agents of acute intestinal infections in children aged under 5 years. The main danger among these pathogens is represented by both enterotoxigenic E. coli causing enteritis and enterocolitis accompanied by acute dehydration diarrhea and Escherichia producing shiga-toxin being agents of hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. The fast and proper identification of agents of these two groups of pathogens is an important task of bacteriologists to be resolved for successful treatment of patient because tactics of therapy of enterotoxigenic diarrhea and hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome significantly differ. The high capacity of Escherichia coli to form populations resistant to anti-microbial medications, including pan-resistant ones, also is a serious problem for science and public health. The object of study was a collection of isolates of E. coli (n = 112), separated from 112 children aged under 5 years with clinical manifestations of acute intestinal infection, food toxic infection hemocolitis and diarrhea of obscure etiology in Yaroslavl in 2015-2017. Initially, the strains of E. coli were tested using diagnostic agglutinating coli-serums and then using reagents' kit «AmpliSens®Escherichiosis-FL» for detection and differentiation DNAof diarrheagenic bacteria coli and also with specific oligonucleotide primers to genes of virulence and O-serum group belonging. The obtained data permitted to determine belonging of analyzed strains of E. coli to four sub-groups: ЕНЕС (n = 9), EPEC (n = 17), ETEC (n = 1) и EAgEС (n = 1). All of them were agents of genes of pathogenicity specific for every pathogroup. The most numerous group EPEC was represented by strains of five serogroups with dominating among them serogroup O26 (9 strains). Therefore, studying collection of strains of diarrheagenic Escherichia isolated during 2015-1017 in Yaroslavl from children aged under 5 years with acute intestinal infections permitted to demonstrate efficiency of application of molecular genetic methods of analysis for characterizing E. coli i.e. establishment their serogroups, detection of genes of virulence and attributing to pathogroups."
30677225,"An accurate genotyping analysis is one of the critical prerequisites for lung cancer targeted therapy. Here, a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based mutation detection system, mutation-selected amplification-specific system PCR (MASS-PCR), is developed. The specific primers and probes used in MASS-PCR exactly match with the mutant sequence that only allows mutant gene to emit the fluorescence peak. To determine the sensitivity of MASS-PCR, 717 lung cancer specimens, 61 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues, and 656 fresh reaction tissues are collected and undergo mutation detection of lung cancer driver genes (EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, HER2, MET, ALK, and ROS1). These samples are divided into two groups. Mutations in Group I, which has 631 fresh reaction tissues, are analyzed by MASS-PCR and the amplification refractory mutation system PCR (ARMS-PCR). While group II samples, 25 fresh reaction tissues and 61 FFPE tissues, are screened through MASS-PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS). All results are verified by direct sequencing. MASS-PCR shows high consistency with ARMS-PCR (kappa value > 0.733) and NGS (kappa value = 0.79) (P < 0.001). For the samples with inconsistent MASS-PCR and ARMS-PCR results, DS results more likely support the MASS-PCR results. These data suggest that MASS-PCR is a convenient, accurate, and economical method for the detection of lung cancer driver gene mutations in clinical practice."
30677208,"Recent metagenomic studies have provided an unprecedented wealth of data, which is revolutionizing our understanding of virus diversity. A redrawn landscape highlights viruses as active players in the phytobiome, and surveys have uncovered their positive roles in environmental stress tolerance of plants. Viral infectious clones are key tools for functional characterization of known and newly identified viruses. Knowledge of viruses and their components has been instrumental for the development of modern plant molecular biology and biotechnology. In this review, we provide extensive guidelines built on current synthetic biology advances that streamline infectious clone assembly, thus lessening a major technical constraint of plant virology. The focus is on generation of infectious clones in binary T-DNA vectors, which are delivered efficiently to plants by Agrobacterium. We then summarize recent applications of plant viruses and explore emerging trends in microbiology, bacterial and human virology that, once translated to plant virology, could lead to development of virus-based gene therapies for ad hoc engineering of plant traits. The systematic characterization of plant virus roles in the phytobiome and next-generation virus-based tools will be indispensable landmarks in the synthetic biology roadmap to better crops.

30677026,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative condition caused by dysregulation of multiple molecular signalling pathways. Such dysregulation results in damage to cartilage, a smooth and protective tissue that enables low friction articulation of synovial joints. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), especially MMP-13, are key enzymes in the cleavage of type II collagen which is a vital component for cartilage integrity. Transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) can protect against pro-inflammatory cytokine-mediated MMP expression. With age there is a change in the ratio of two TGFβ type I receptors (Alk1/Alk5), a shift that results in TGFβ losing its protective role in cartilage homeostasis. Instead, TGFβ promotes cartilage degradation which correlates with the spontaneous development of OA in murine models. However, the mechanism by which TGFβ protects against pro-inflammatory responses and how this changes with age has not been extensively studied. As TGFβ signalling is complex, we used systems biology to combine experimental and computational outputs to examine how the system changes with age. Experiments showed that the repressive effect of TGFβ on chondrocytes treated with a pro-inflammatory stimulus required Alk5. Computational modelling revealed two independent mechanisms were needed to explain the crosstalk between TGFβ and pro-inflammatory signalling pathways. A novel meta-analysis of microarray data from OA patient tissue was used to create a Cytoscape network representative of human OA and revealed the importance of inflammation. Combining the modelled genes with the microarray network provided a global overview into the crosstalk between the different signalling pathways involved in OA development. Our results provide further insights into the mechanisms that cause TGFβ signalling to change from a protective to a detrimental pathway in cartilage with ageing. Moreover, such a systems biology approach may enable restoration of the protective role of TGFβ as a potential therapy to prevent age-related loss of cartilage and the development of OA."

30676543,"Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain is a major dose-limiting and therapy-limiting adverse effect that is particularly difficult to treat. Puerarin, a major active ingredient of traditional Chinese plant medicine Gegen, is commonly used in the treatment of myocardial and cerebral ischemia. However, the effects of puerarin on neuropathic pain are still unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the effects of puerarin on neuropathic pain. In this study, the effects of puerarin were tested in-vivo on a rat model of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathic pain (PIPNP). The results show that a single injection of puerarin produced short-term analgesic effect on pre-established PIPNP, as indicated by decreased mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in comparison with paclitaxel-treated rats. Repeated doses of puerarin, given during PIPNP induction, prevented the development of PIPNP. This prophylactic effect of puerarin was associated with suppressed paclitaxel-induced transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, calcitonin gene-related peptide and substance P up-regulation in the dorsal root ganglia. These findings revealed the therapeutic potential of puerarin in treating and preventing chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathic pain."

30676128,"Autoimmune encephalitides have been accepted as a reproducible and treatable new group of diseases. At present, there is concern that such diagnoses might be made too liberally. Areas covered: This article suggests how to make valid diagnoses. They should consist of three elements: the clinical syndrome, the associated antibody and the presumed cause or predisposition. Recently, an international consortium published formal clinical criteria for autoimmune encephalitides to enable diagnoses even if antibody testing is not (immediately) available and to prevent overinterpretation of questionable antibody results. Antibody testing has greatly benefitted from the introduction of cell-based assays for the demonstration of antibodies against surface antigens. Paraneoplastic or post-infectious situations, side effects of tumor therapies or genetic predispositions help to explain why a patient develops autoimmune encephalitis. Expert opinion: With the application of this three-fold diagnostic system, clinicians can counsel patients regarding therapy and prognosis, while researchers can form meaningful patient cohorts. An operationalization of criteria would be advantageous."
30676115,"Despite the potency of current antiretrovirals, some patients continue to struggle with the management of the treatment of HIV due to drug resistance-associated mutations. The underlying causes of these developments are usually drug adherence and drug availability as well as the economic affordability of those potent drugs in low to middle-income countries as well as in some industrialised countries. Viral replication, despite therapy, varies by region from 5 to 28. Non-adherence includes a variety of behaviours with different clinical implications. Addressing non-adherence and choosing new regimens based on a strategic vision may aid overall treatment strategies in the future. Areas covered: The authors review the literature derived from Embase, MEDLINE and the main international congresses on transmitted and selected drug resistance to HIV therapeutics. They also consider the pharmacological aspects of antiretroviral therapy including the genetic barrier, convenience, potency, drug-drug interactions and tolerability are discuss prospective randomized or observational clinical trials on salvage therapy. Expert opinion: Preventive intervention is the most efficient way to reduce the selection and transmission of drug-resistant mutations. While subjects with no current available options may benefit from new compounds (ibalizumab and fostemsavir), strategies should be implemented to spare as many patients as possible from drug resistance."
30676006,"Objective To assess the spectrum of associated anomalies, the intrauterine course, postnatal outcome and management of fetuses with double outlet right ventricle (DORV). Methods All cases of DORV diagnosed prenatally over a period of 8 years were retrospectively collected in a single tertiary referral center. All additional prenatal findings were assessed and correlated with the outcome. The accuracy of prenatal diagnosis was assessed. Results Forty-six cases of DORV were diagnosed prenatally. The mean gestational age at first diagnosis was 21+4 weeks (range, 13-37). A correct prenatal diagnosis of DORV was made in 96.3% of the cases. If the relation of the great arteries, the position of the ventricular septal defect (VSD) and additional cardiac anomalies are taken into account, the prenatal diagnosis was correct in 92.6% of the cases. One case was postnatally classified as transposition of the great arteries with subpulmonary VSD and was excluded from further analysis. A total of 41 (91.1%) fetuses with DORV had major additional cardiac anomalies, 30 (66.7%) had extracardiac anomalies and 13 (28.9%) had chromosomal or syndromal anomalies. Due to their complex additional anomalies, five (11.1%) of our 45 fetuses had multiple malformations and were highly suspicious for non-chromosomal genetic syndromes, although molecular diagnosis could not be provided. Disorders of laterality occurred in 10 (22.2%) fetuses. There were 17 terminations of pregnancy (37.8%), two (4.4%) intrauterine and seven (15.6%) postnatal deaths. Nineteen of 22 (86.4%) live-born children with an intention to treat were alive at last follow-up. The mean follow-up among survivors was 32 months (range, 2-72). Of 21 children who had already undergone postnatal surgery, eight (38.1%) achieved biventricular repair and 13 (61.9%) received univentricular palliation. One recently born child is still waiting for surgery. All children predicted prenatally to need a single ventricle palliation, and all children predicted to achieve biventricular repair, ultimately received the predicted type of surgery. After surgery, 14 of 18 (77.8%) children were healthy without any impairment. Conclusion DORV is a rare and often complex cardiac anomaly that can be diagnosed prenatally with high precision. DORV is frequently associated with major additional anomalies, leading to a high intrauterine and postnatal loss rate due to terminations or declined postnatal therapy. Without additional anomalies, the prognosis is good, although approximately 60% of children will have single ventricle palliation."

30675801,"The urothelium of the bladder, renal pelvis, ureter and urethra is maintained through the regulated proliferation and differentiation of urothelial stem and progenitor cells. These cells provide a rich source of a novel urothelial cell therapy approach that could be used to protect, regenerate, repair and restore a damaged urothelium. Urothelial injury caused by physical, chemical and microbial stress is the pathological basis of cystitis (bladder inflammation). The loss of urothelial integrity triggers a series of inflammatory events, resulting in pain and hematuria such as hemorrhage cystitis and interstitial cystitis. Here we investigate a novel cell therapy strategy to treat cystitis by protecting the urothelium from detrimental stresses through intravesically instilling porcine urothelial cells (PUCs) into the bladder. Using a chemical-induced urothelial injury mouse model of cyclophosphamide (CPP)-induced hemorrhagic cystitis, we determined how the intravesical instillation of PUCs could protect the urothelium from toxic attack from CPP metabolites. We show that intravesical PUC instillation protected the bladder from toxic chemical attack in mice receiving CPP with reduced inflammation and edema. Compared with the vehicle control mice, the proliferative response to chemical injury and apoptotic cells within the bladder tissues were reduced by intravesical PUC treatment. Furthermore, the urothelium integrity was maintained in the intravesical PUC-treated group. After xenogeneic PUCs were introduced and adhered to the mouse urothelium, immunological rejection responses were observed with increased neutrophil infiltration in the lamina propria and higher immune-related gene expression. Our findings provide an innovative and promising intravesical PUC cell therapy for cystitis with urothelial injury by protecting the urothelium from noxious agents."
30675668,"Melanoma has several clinically and pathologically distinguishable subtypes, which also differ genetically. Mutation patterns vary among different melanoma subtypes, and efficacy of immune-checkpoint inhibitors differs depending on the subtype of melanoma. In spite of the recent revolution of systemic therapies for advanced melanoma, access to innovative agents is still restricted in many countries. This review article aimed to describe the epidemiology and current status of systemic therapies for melanoma in Japan, where melanoma is rare, but access to innovative agents is available. Acral and mucosal melanomas, which are common in Asian populations, predominantly occur in sun-protected areas and share several biological features. Both the melanomas harbor KIT mutation in approximately 15% of the cases; BRAF or NRAS mutation is found in approximately 10-15% of acral melanoma, but these mutations are less frequent in mucosal melanoma. Combined use of BRAF and MEK inhibitors is one of the standards of care for patients with advanced BRAF-mutant melanoma. In patients with melanoma harboring KIT mutation in exon 11 or 13, KIT inhibitors can be a treatment option; however, none of them have been approved in Japan. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors are expected to be less effective against acral and mucosal melanomas because their somatic mutation burden is lower than those in non-acral cutaneous melanomas. A recently completed phase II trial of nivolumab and ipilimumab combination therapy in 30 Japanese patients with melanoma, including seven with acral and 12 with mucosal melanoma, demonstrated an objective response rate of 43%. Regarding oncolytic viruses, canerpaturev (C-REV, also known as HF10) and talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC) are currently under review in early phase trials. In the adjuvant setting, dabrafenib plus trametinb combination, nivolumab monotherapy, and pembrolizumab monotherapy were approved in July, August, and December 2018 in Japan, respectively. However, most of the adjuvant phase III trials excluded patients with mucosal melanoma. A phase III trial of adjuvant therapy with locoregional interferon (IFN)-β versus surgery alone is ongoing in Japan (JCOG1309, J-FERON), in which IFN-β is injected directly into the site of the primary tumor postoperatively, so that it would be drained through the untreated lymphatic route to the regional node basin. After the recent approval of these new agents, the JCOG1309 trial will be revised to focus on patients with stage II disease. In conclusion, acral and mucosal melanomas have been treated based on the available medical evidence for the treatment of non-acral cutaneous melanomas. Considering the differences in genetic backgrounds and therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy, specialized therapeutic strategies for these subtypes of melanoma should be established in the future."
30675352,"Leprosy, a human chronic granulomatous disease caused by <i>Mycobacterium leprae (M. leprae)</i>, remains endemic in certain countries despite the use of multidrug therapy. Recently, several host genes modulating the immune responses to <i>M. leprae</i> infection have been suggested to influence the acquisition and clinical course of leprosy. Lymphoid protein tyrosine phosphatase, encoded by the protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 22 (<i>PTPN22</i>) gene, serves a negative regulatory role in T cell activation. The non-synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2476601 (1858C>T) has been associated with autoimmune diseases. Here, the present study investigated if rs2476601 polymorphism was associated with leprosy in a Mexican mestizo population. Genotyping was performed in patients with leprosy (n=189) and control subjects (n=231) from regions with higher incidence of leprosy. Genotypic (P=0.44) and allelic frequencies (P=0.45) of the rs2476601 polymorphism were similar between patients and controls; genotypic frequencies were 91 vs. 94% for CC and 9 vs. 6% for CT, and the TT genotype was absent in both groups. Allelic frequencies were 96 vs. 97% for C, and 4 vs. 3% for T. In the same way, the genotypic (P=0.46) and allelic frequencies (P=0.47) from MB patients and controls were similar. In conclusion, there was a lack of association of the <i>PTPN22</i> rs2476601 polymorphism with the development of leprosy, which suggests that this SNP was not a genetic risk factor for leprosy in the Mexican mestizo population studied."
30675309,"Beclin 1 is involved in autophagy, differentiation, apoptosis and cancer progression, and functions as a haploinsufficient tumor suppressor gene. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the function of Beclin 1 in colon cancer. A Beclin 1-expressing plasmid was transfected into HCT-15 and HCT-116 cells, and the phenotypes and associated molecules were determined. Beclin 1 transfectants were subcutaneously injected into nude mice to determine tumor growth, and proliferation and apoptosis levels using Ki-67 immunostaining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL), respectively. Beclin 1 overexpression inhibited viability as determined using a Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, inhibited migration and invasion as determined using a wound healing assay or Transwell assay, and lamellipodia formation by filamentous actin staining, induced autophagy as determined using electron microscopy, and light chain 3B (LC-3B) expression, and apoptosis as determined using Annexin V staining in the two cell lines (P<0.05). Beclin 1 induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest of HCT-15 transfectants as determined using propidium iodide staining (P<0.05), whereas HCT-116 transfectants were arrested in G<sub>1</sub> phase (P<0.05). The two transfectants exhibited increased expression of c-Myc, cyclin D1, β-catenin, insulin-response element 1 and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein compared with the control and mock cells as determined using the reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (P<0.05). Beclin 1 overexpression upregulated LC-3B and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 expression, but downregulated cyclin E expression of the cancer cell lines as determined using western blot analysis (P<0.05). Beclin 1 expression <i>in vivo</i> significantly suppressed the proliferation of colon cancer cells in xenograft models via inducing apoptosis by TUNEL, and inhibiting proliferation by Ki-67 expression (P<0.05). Beclin 1 overexpression may reverse aggressive phenotypes and suppress colon cancer tumor growth, and be employed as a target molecule for gene therapy of patients with colon cancer."
30675303,"Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) is the most common type of oral cancer. Despite advances in knowledge regarding the genome-scale gene expression pattern of oral cancer, the molecular portrait of OTSCC biology has remained unclear over the last few decades. Furthermore, studies concerning OTSCC gene-expression profiles are limited or inconsistent owing to tissue heterogeneity in single-cohort studies. Consequently, the present study integrated the profile datasets of three cohorts in order to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), and subsequently identified the potential candidate genes and pathways in OTSCC through gene enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Using the selected Gene Expression Omnibus datasets GSE13601, GSE31056 and GSE78060, 206 DEGs (125 upregulated and 81 downregulated) were identified in OTSCC, principally associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) organization and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling pathway. Furthermore, 146/206 DEGs were filtered into the PPI network and 20 hub genes were sorted. Further results indicated that the two most significant modules filtered from the PPI network were associated with ECM organization and human papillomavirus infection, which are important factors affecting OTSCC pathology. Overall, a set of OTSCC-associated DEGs has been identified, including certain key candidate genes that may be of vital importance for diagnosis, therapy and prevention of this disease."
30675298,"Ovarian cancer gene 1 (<i>OVCA1</i>) is a tumor suppressor associated with ovarian cancer, which is involved in cell proliferation regulation, embryonic development and tumorigenesis. Loss of heterozygosity in the <i>OVCA1</i> gene occurs in 50-86% of cases of ovarian cancer; however, the physiological and biochemical functions of OVCA1 are not yet clear. In the present study, the stability and degradation of OVCA1 were investigated in A2780, Hela and 293 cells. The results revealed that the OVCA1 protein was unstable by MG132 inhibiting proteasome mediated degradation, co-immunoprecipitation and half-life measurement experiments. The cellular protein levels of endogenous OVCA1 were too low to be detected by western blotting. In addition, carbobenzoxy-L-leucyl-L-leucyl-L-leucinal inhibited the degradation of OVCA1 in cells. The co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the OVCA1 protein interacted with ubiquitin to form a poly-ubiquitinated complex in cells. The half-life of OVCA1, measured by inhibiting protein synthesis with cycloheximide, was <2 h. The present study demonstrated that OVCA1 may be degraded by the ubiquitin-mediated proteasome pathway and may be considered a short half-life protein. In conclusion, the regulation of OVCA1 protein degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway may represent a novel direction in the development of ovarian cancer therapy."
30675281,"Effect of STAT3 decoy oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) transduced by ultrasound microbubbles combined with ultrasound on the growth of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and its mechanism were analyzed. EC9706 cells were cultured in vitro and divided into four groups: group E (ultrasound microbubble + ultrasound irradiation), group P (liposome + ultrasound irradiation), group C (ultrasound), and group CC (ultrasound microbubbles). Mutant ODNs were used in groups E and P and the control group was group EC and PC, respectively. Immunofluorescence assay and flow cytometry were used to detect the transfection efficiency of each group. MTT colorimetric assay was performed to analyze the inhibition rate in each group. The effect of STAT3 decoy ODN on the proliferation of esophageal squamous carcinoma cells was calculated. Revese transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were performed to detect the expression of the STAT signaling pathway downstream of gene expression levels. The model of subcutaneous transplantation of nude mice was used to show the effect of different transfections and STAT3 decoy ODN on the weight and volume of the transplanted tumor in mice. The cell inhibition rate was higher in group E than in groups P (F=8.382, P<0.001) and CC (F=6.469, P<0.001). Compared with groups EC, PC and C, respectively, the mRNA expression of STAT3, bcl-xL and Cyclin D1 decreased in groups E, P and CC (F=5.328, P<0.001). The weight and volume of nude mice in groups E, P and CC exhibited an inhibitory effect on the weight and volume of nude mice. Ultrasound irradiation combined with ultrasound microbubbles is an effective transfection method. The transfection of STAT3 decoy ODN can significantly inhibit the activity of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells and enhance apoptosis of cells, which has potential clinical value."
30675269,"Receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) serves a crucial role in brain development. <i>ALK</i> is located on the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p23) and exchange of chromosomal segments with other genes, including nucleophosmin (<i>NPM</i>), echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (<i>EML4</i>) and <i>Trk</i>-fused gene (<i>TFG</i>), readily occurs. Such chromosomal translocation results in the formation of chimeric <i>X-ALK</i> fusion oncoproteins, which possess potential oncogenic functions due to constitutive activation of ALK kinase. These proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of various hematological malignancies and solid tumors, including lymphoma, lung cancer, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs), Spitz tumors, renal carcinoma, thyroid cancer, digestive tract cancer, breast cancer, leukemia and ovarian carcinoma. Targeting of ALK fusion oncoproteins exclusively, or in combination with ALK kinase inhibitors including crizotinib, is the most common therapeutic strategy. As is often the case for small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), drug resistance eventually develops via an adaptive secondary mutation in the <i>ALK</i> fusion oncogene, or through engagement of alternative signaling mechanisms. The updated mechanisms of a variety of <i>ALK</i> fusions in tumorigenesis, proliferation and metastasis, in addition to targeted therapies are discussed below."
30675260,"The prognosis for patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) remains poor, owing to uncontrolled tumor invasion and metastasis. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) serves an important role in this invasion and metastasis, and transient receptor potential polycystic 2 (TRPP2) enhances metastasis and invasion by regulating EMT in human laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma. The present study examined whether exosomes/TRPP2 small interfering RNA (siRNA) complexes were able to reduce EMT by suppressing TRPP2 expression in FaDu cells, a cell line of human pharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Using agarose gel electrophoresis, it was determined that exosome/TRPP2 siRNA complexes were stable in the presence of nucleases and serum. A fluorescence assay and western blotting analysis was performed, and it was reported that the FaDu cells took up exosomes, the exosomes effectively delivered TRPP2 siRNA into FaDu cells and that exosome/TRPP2 siRNA complexes significantly suppressed TRPP2 protein expression levels in FaDu cells. Furthermore, expression levels of E-cadherin were significantly increased, whereas expression levels of N-cadherin and vimentin were significantly decreased in FaDu cells transfected with TRPP2 siRNA. Thus, exosome/TRPP2 siRNA complexes markedly suppressed TRPP2 expression and EMT in FaDu cells. These results suggested that further development of exosome/TRPP2 siRNA complexes for use as an RNA-based gene therapy in the treatment of HNC is warranted."
30675180,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem cells that can be isolated and expanded from many tissues, and are being investigated for use in cell therapies. Though MSC therapies have demonstrated some success, none have been FDA approved for clinical use. MSCs lose stemness <i>ex vivo,</i> decreasing therapeutic potential, and face additional barriers <i>in vivo,</i> decreasing therapeutic efficacy. Culture optimization and genetic modification of MSCs can overcome these barriers. Viral transduction is efficient, but limited by safety concerns related to mutagenicity of integrating viral vectors and potential immunogenicity of viral antigens. Nonviral delivery methods are safer, though limited by inefficiency and toxicity, and are flexible and scalable, making them attractive for engineering MSC therapies."

The sequence features of endogenous binding sites will help us to fully understand the site-specific recognition function by ΦC31 integrase. The present study was aimed to uncover the global map of ΦC31 integrase binding sites in bovine cells and analysis the features of these binding sites by comprehensive bioinformatics methods."
30675131,"Acute lung injury (ALI) affects over 10% of patients hospitalised in critical care, with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being the most severe form of ALI and having a mortality rate in the region of 40%. There has been slow but incremental progress in identification of biomarkers that contribute to the pathophysiology of ARDS, have utility in diagnosis and monitoring, and that are potential therapeutic targets (Calfee CS, Delucchi K, Parsons PE, Thompson BT, Ware LB, Matthay MA, Thompson T, Ware LB, Matthay MA, Lancet Respir Med 2014, 2:611--620). However, a major issue is that ARDS is such a heterogeneous, multi-factorial, end-stage condition that the strategies for ""lumping and splitting"" are critical (Prescott HC, Calfee CS, Thompson BT, Angus DC, Liu VX, Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2016, 194:147--155). Nevertheless, sequencing of the human genome, the availability of improved methods for analysis of transcription to mRNA (gene expression), and development of sensitive immunoassays has allowed the application of network biology to ARDS, with these biomarkers offering potential for personalised or precision medicine (Sweeney TE, Khatri P, Toward precision medicine Crit Care Med; 2017 45:934-939). Biomarker panels have potential applications in molecular phenotyping for identifying patients at risk of developing ARDS, diagnosis of ARDS, risk stratification and monitoring. Two subphenotypes of ARDS have been identified on the basis of blood biomarkers: hypo-inflammatory and hyper-inflammatory. The hyper-inflammatory subphenotype is associated with shock, metabolic acidosis and worst clinical outcomes. Biomarkers of particular interest have included interleukins (IL-6 and IL-8), interferon gamma (IFN-γ), surfactant proteins (SPD and SPB), von Willebrand factor antigen, angiopoietin 1/2 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In terms of gene expression (mRNA) in blood there have been found to be increases in neutrophil-related genes in sepsis-induced and influenza-induced ARDS, but whole blood expression does not give a robust diagnostic test for ARDS. Despite improvements in management of ARDS on the critical care unit, this complex disease continues to be a major life-threatening event. Clinical trials of β<sub>2</sub>-agonists, statins, surfactants and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) have been disappointing. In addition, monoclonal antibodies (anti-TNF) and TNFR fusion protein have also been unconvincing. However, there have been major advances in methods of mechanical ventilation, a neuromuscular blocker (cisatracurium besilate) has shown some benefit, and stem cell therapy is being developed. In the future, by understanding the role of biomarkers in the pathophysiology of ARDS and lung injury, it is hoped that this will provide rational therapeutic targets and ultimately improve clinical care (Seymour CW, Gomez H, Chang CH, Clermont G, Kellum JA, Kennedy J, Yende S, Angus DC, Crit Care 2017, 21:257)."
30675060,"Diffuse gliomas are the most common malignant brain tumours in adults and include glioblastomas and World Health Organization (WHO) grade II and grade III tumours (sometimes referred to as lower-grade gliomas). Genetic tumour profiling is used to classify disease and guide therapy<sup>1,2</sup>, but involves brain surgery for tissue collection; repeated tumour biopsies may be necessary for accurate genotyping over the course of the disease<sup>3-10</sup>. While the detection of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of patients with primary brain tumours remains challenging<sup>11,12</sup>, sequencing of ctDNA from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may provide an alternative way to genotype gliomas with lower morbidity and cost<sup>13,14</sup>. We therefore evaluated the representation of the glioma genome in CSF from 85 patients with gliomas who underwent a lumbar puncture because they showed neurological signs or symptoms. Here we show that tumour-derived DNA was detected in CSF from 42 out of 85 patients (49.4%) and was associated with disease burden and adverse outcome. The genomic landscape of glioma in the CSF included a broad spectrum of genetic alterations and closely resembled the genomes of tumour biopsies. Alterations that occur early during tumorigenesis, such as co-deletion of chromosome arms 1p and 19q (1p/19q codeletion) and mutations in the metabolic genes isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) or IDH2<sup>1,2</sup>, were shared in all matched ctDNA-positive CSF-tumour pairs, whereas growth factor receptor signalling pathways showed considerable evolution. The ability to monitor the evolution of the glioma genome through a minimally invasive technique could advance the clinical development and use of genotype-directed therapies for glioma, one of the most aggressive human cancers."
30675023,"After the discovery of motilin in 1972, motilin and the motilin receptor were studied intensely for their role in the control of gastrointestinal motility and as targets for treating hypomotility disorders. The genetic revolution - with the use of knockout models - sparked novel insights into the role of multiple peptides but contributed to a decline in interest in motilin, as this peptide and its receptor exist only as pseudogenes in rodents. The past 5 years have seen a major surge in interest in motilin, as a series of studies have shown its relevance in the control of hunger and regulation of food intake in humans in both health and disease. Luminal stimuli, such as bitter tastants, have been identified as modulators of motilin release, with effects on hunger and food intake. The current state of knowledge and potential implications for therapy are summarized in this Review."
30674943,"There is conflicting evidence that MDR1, MRP2 and LRP expression is responsible for chemotherapy resistance. We conducted this study to explore their role in AML therapy outcomes. Bone marrow and peripheral blood samples of 90 AML patients, receiving chemotherapy, were analyzed by real time PCR. Gene expression was calculated by the 2<sup>-ΔΔCt</sup> method. The patients who had a persistent remission were labelled 'Good Responder' (GRes) whereas, those with relapse or drug resistance were labelled 'Poor Responders' (PRes). Higher LRP expression in bone marrow, but not in peripheral blood, was positively associated with persistent remission (p = 0.001), GRes (p = 0.002), 1-year overall as well as disease-free survival (p = 0.02 and p = 0.007, respectively). Marrow and blood MDR1 and MRP2 expression did not differ significantly between the above groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that only a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL; M3) or high marrow LRP expression significantly predicted a favorable therapeutic outcome. This is the first report showing that high bone marrow LRP expression predicts significant favorable therapeutic outcome. Peripheral blood LRP expression as well as marrow and blood MDR1 and MRP2 expression have no predictive value in AML patients treated with standard dose cytarabine and daunorubicin 3+7 regimen."
30674872,"Androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with newly developed antiandrogen enzalutamide (Enz) may increase the castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) patients survival an extra 4.8 months. Yet eventually most patients may fail with development of Enz resistance. While recent clinical studies indicated that the increased expression of the androgen receptor (AR) splicing variant ARv7 might have key roles for the development of Enz resistance in CRPC, its detailed mechanism, especially its linkage to the circular RNAs (circRNAs), a form of non-coding RNA, however, remains unclear. Here we found from human clinical sample survey that circRNA17 (hsa_circ_0001427) has a lower expression in higher Gleason score PCa, and results from in vitro cell lines studies also revealed the lower expression in CRPC C4-2 Enz-resistant (EnzR-C4-2) cells compared to their parental Enz-sensitive (EnzS-C4-2) cells. Mechanism dissection indicated that suppressing circRNA17 in EnzS-C4-2 cells increased ARv7 expression that might then lead to increase the Enz resistance and cell invasion. Mechanism dissection demonstrated that Enz could suppress the circRNA17 expression at the transcriptional level via suppressing transcription of its host gene PDLIM5, and circRNA17 could regulate ARv7 expression via altering the expression of miR-181c-5p that involved the direct binding of miR-181c-5p to the 3'UTR of ARv7. Preclinical study using in vivo mouse model with xenografted EnzR-CWR22Rv1 cells revealed that adding circRNA17 or miRNA-181c-5p could suppress the EnzR-CWR22Rv1 cells growth. Together, results from these preclinical studies suggest that circRNA17 may function as suppressor to alter the Enz sensitivity and cell invasion in CRPC cells via altering the miR-181c-5p/ARv7 signaling and targeting this newly identified signaling may help in the development of a better therapy to further suppress the EnzR cell growth."
30674742,"We previously showed that the promoter region of the human epidermal growth factor receptor (hEGFR) gene elicits high transduction efficiency, with transgene expression restricted to canine breast tumor cells. However, it was unclear whether this promoter induces tumor cell-specific transgene expression in canine urothelial carcinoma cells. Furthermore, compared with studies in human cancer cells, the utility of the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) gene promoter for therapeutic transgene expression in canine cancer cells has not been evaluated thus far. Here, we compared the activity of these promoters in canine mammary tumor and urothelial carcinoma cells. Our results showed that compared with the TERT promoter, the hEGFR promoter was more useful as a tumor-specific promoter to induce efficient transgene expression in canine tumor cells."
30674723,"Patients with heterozygous missense mutations in the ACTA2 or MYH11 gene are known to exhibit thoracic aortic aneurysm and a risk of early-onset aortic dissection. However, less common phenotypes involving arterial obstruction are also observed, including coronary and cerebrovascular stenotic disease. Herein we implicate the HDAC9 complex in transcriptional silencing of contractile protein-associated genes, known to undergo downregulation in stenotic lesions. Furthermore, neointimal formation was inhibited in HDAC9- or MALAT1-deficient mice with preservation of contractile protein expression. Pharmacologic targeting of the HDAC9 complex through either MALAT1 antisense oligonucleotides or inhibition of the methyltransferase EZH2 (catalytic mediator recruited by the HDAC9 complex) reduced neointimal formation. In conclusion, we report the implication of the HDAC9 complex in stenotic disease and demonstrate that pharmacologic therapy targeting epigenetic complexes can ameliorate arterial obstruction in an experimental system."
30674722,"Liver cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer-related mortality and is distinguished by a relative paucity of chemotherapy options. It has been hypothesized that intratumor genetic heterogeneity may contribute to the high failure rate of chemotherapy. Here, we evaluated functional heterogeneity in a cohort of primary human liver cancer organoid lines. Each primary human liver cancer surgical specimen was used to generate multiple cancer organoid lines, obtained from distinct regions of the tumor. A total of 27 liver cancer lines were established and tested with 129 cancer drugs, generating 3,483 cell survival data points. We found a rich intratumor, functional (drug response) heterogeneity in our liver cancer patients. Furthermore, we established that the majority of drugs were either ineffective, or effective only in select organoid lines. In contrast, we found that a subset of drugs appeared pan-effective, displaying at least moderate activity in the majority of these cancer organoid lines. These drugs, which are FDA approved for indications other than liver cancers, deserve further consideration as either systemic or local therapeutics. Of note, molecular profiles, obtained for a reduced sample set, did not correlate with the drug response heterogeneity of liver cancer organoid lines. Taken together, these findings lay the foundation for in-depth studies of pan-effective drugs, as well as for functional personalized oncology approaches. Lastly, these functional studies demonstrate the utility of cancer organoid drug testing as part of a drug discovery pipeline."

30674534,"Inevitable tumor recurrence and a poor median survival are frustrating reminders of the inefficacy of our current standard of care for patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma (GBM), which includes surgery followed by radiation therapy (RT) and chemotherapy with the DNA alkylating agent temozolomide (TMZ). Because resistance to genotoxic damage is achieved mainly through execution of the DNA damage response (DDR) and DNA repair pathways, knowledge of the changes in DNA repair and cell cycle gene expression that occur during tumor development might help identify new targets and improve treatment. Here we performed a gene expression analysis targeting components of the DNA repair and cell cycle machineries in cohorts of paired tumor samples (i.e., biopsies from the same patient obtained at the time of primary tumor operation and at recurrence) from patients treated with RT or RT plus TMZ. We identified and validated a 27-gene signature that resulted in the classification of GBM specimens into three groups, two of which displayed inverse expression profiles. Each group contained primary and recurrent samples, and the tumor at relapse frequently displayed a gene expression profile different from that of the matched primary biopsy. Within the groups that exhibited opposing gene expression profiles, the expression pattern of the gene signature at relapse was linked to progression-free survival. We provide experimental evidence that our signature exposes group-specific vulnerabilities against genotoxicants and inhibitors of the cell cycle and DDR, with the prospect of personalized therapeutic strategies."
30674533,"Metastasis is a major cause of cancer-related deaths. A dearth in preclinical models that recapitulates the metastatic microenvironment has impeded the development of therapeutic agents that are effective against metastatic disease. Since the majority of solid tumors metastasize to the lung, we developed a multi-cellular lung organoid that mimics the lung microenvironment with air sac like structures and production of lung surfactant protein. We used these cultures called primitive lung-in-a-dish (PLiD), to recreate metastatic disease using primary and established cancer cells. The metastatic tumor-in-a-dish (mTiD) cultures resemble the architecture of metastatic tumors in the lung including angiogenesis. Pretreating PLiD with tumor exosomes enhanced cancer cell colonization. We next tested the response of primary and established cancer cells to current chemotherapeutic agents and an anti-VEGF antibody in mTiD against cancer cells in 2-dimensional (2D) or 3D cultures. The response of primary patient-derived colon and ovarian tumor cells to therapy in mTiD cultures matched the response of the patient in the clinic, but not 2D or single cell type 3D cultures. The sensitive mTiD cultures also produced significantly lower circulating markers for cancer similar to that seen in patients that responded to therapy. Thus, we have developed a novel method for tumor colonization in vitro, a final stage in tumor metastasis. Moreover, the technique has significant utility in precision/personalized medicine, wherein this phenotypic screen can be coupled with current DNA pharmacogenetics to identify the ideal therapeutic agent, thereby increasing the probability of response to treatment while reducing unnecessary side effects."
30674531,"A combination therapy approach is required to improve tumor immune infiltration and patient response to immune checkpoint inhibitors that target negative regulatory receptors. Galectin-3 is a β-galactoside-binding lectin that is highly expressed within the tumor microenvironment of aggressive cancers and whose expression correlates with poor survival particularly in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. To examine the role of galectin-3 inhibition in NSCLC, we tested the effects of galectin-3 depletion using genetic and pharmacological approaches on syngeneic mouse lung adenocarcinoma and human lung adenocarcinoma xenografts. Galectin-3- /- mice developed significantly smaller and fewer tumors and metastases than syngeneic C57/Bl6 wild type mice. Macrophage ablation retarded tumor growth whilst reconstitution with galectin- 3-positive bone marrow restored tumor growth in galectin-3-/- mice, indicating that macrophages were a major driver of the anti-tumor response. Oral administration of a novel small molecule galectin-3 inhibitor GB1107 reduced human and mouse lung adenocarcinoma growth and blocked metastasis in the syngeneic model. Treatment with GB1107 increased tumor M1 macrophage polarization and CD8+ T cell infiltration. Moreover, GB1107 potentiated the effects of a PD-L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor to increase expression of cytotoxic (IFN-γ, granzyme B, perforin-1, Fas ligand) and apoptotic (cleaved caspase-3) effector molecules. In summary, galectin-3 is an important regulator of lung adenocarcinoma progression. The novel galectin-3 inhibitor presented could provide an effective, non-toxic monotherapy or be used in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors to boost immune infiltration and responses in lung adenocarcinoma and potentially other aggressive cancers."
30674213,"Recently, the use of photodynamic therapy grows as an alternative treatment for cancer, since it has a noninvasive characteristic and affinity to the tumor tissue. Accordingly, understanding the therapy's foci of action is important for the technique improvement. This work aims to understand the genotoxic effect triggered by the therapy action, thus evidencing the permanent changes caused to the genetic material of the tumor cell after the treatment. Therefore, to increase the knowledge in this study field, the methodology of the comet assay and count of micronucleus formed after the therapy was adopted in order to understand if the damage caused to the DNA of tumor cell makes its replication process unfeasible in future generations. The study allows a better therapeutic approach to the cancer treatment, making the process of association between therapies a more effective option during the disease treatment."
30674064,"An electrical stimulus is a new approach to neural differentiation of stem cells. In this work, the neural differentiation of conjunctiva mesenchymal stem cells (CJMSCs) on a new 3D conductive fibrous scaffold of silk fibroin (SF) and reduced graphene oxide (rGo) were examined. rGo (3.5%w/w) was dispersed in SF-acid formic solution (10% w/v) and conductive nanofibrous scaffold was fabricated using the electrospinning method. SEM and TEM microscopy were used for fibrous scaffold characterization. CJMSCs were cultured on the scaffold and two electrical impulse models (Current 1: 115 V/m, 100 Hz frequency and current 2: 115v/m voltages, 0.1 Hz frequency) were applied for 7 days. Also, the effect of the fibrous scaffold and electrical impulses on cell viability and neural gene expression were examined using MTT assay and qPCR analysis. Fibrous scaffold with the 220±20 nm diameter and good dispersion of graphene nanosheets at the surface of nanofibers were fabricated. The MTT result showed the cell viability of cells on scaffold with current 2 was lower than current 1. qPCR analysis confirmed that the expression of β-tubulin (2.4 fold P ≤ 0.026), MAP-2 (1.48 fold; P ≤ 0.03), and nestin (1.5 fold; P ≤ 0.03) genes were higher in CJMSCs on conductive scaffold with 100Hz frequency compared to 0.1 Hz frequency. Collectively we proposed that SF-rGo fibrous scaffold, as a new conductive fibrous scaffold with electrical stimulation are good strategies for neural differentiation of stem cells and the type of electrical pulses has an influence on neural differentiation and proliferation of CJMSCs.

30673959,"MeCP2 is a protein highly expressed in the brain that participates in the genetic expression and RNA splicing regulation. MeCP2 binds preferably to methylated DNA and other nuclear corepressors to alter chromatin. MECP2 gene mutations can cause rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurological disorder that affects around one in ten thousand girls. In this paper, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to scrutinize how the MeCP2 P152R mutation influences the protein binding to DNA. Also, the Umbrella Sampling technique was used to obtain the potential mean forces (PMFs) of both wild-type and mutated MeCP2 Methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) binding to both non-methylated and methylated DNA. P152R is a common missense mutation in MBD associated with RTT; however, there are no studies that explain how it causes protein dysfunction. The results from this study hypothesize that P152R mutation leads to MBD binding more strongly to DNA, while selectively decreasing binding affinity to methylated DNA. These provide an explanation for previous not conclusive experimental results regarding the mechanism of how this mutation affects the binding of the protein to DNA, and subsequently its effects on RTT. Furthermore, the results of this research-in-progress can be used as the basis for further investigations into the molecular basis of RTT and to potentially reveal a target for therapy in the future."
30673899,"The detection of molecules and mechanisms affecting the malignant phenotype of gastric cancer cells may contribute to the identification of biomarkers for metastasis and recurrence, and such molecules may serve as targets of therapy. For this purpose, in this study transcriptome analysis was performed using surgically resected specimens from patients with gastric cancer with synchronous metastasis. We identified homeobox C10 (HOXC10) as the most highly expressed gene in gastric cancer tissues compared with the adjacent noncancerous gastric mucosa."

30673813,"Despite high remission rates, almost 25% of patients with AML will suffer relapse 3-5 years after diagnosis. Therefore, in addition to existing diagnostic and MRD detection tools, there is still a need for the development of novel approaches that can provide information on the state of the disease. Extracellular vesicles (EVs), containing genetic material reflecting the status of the parental cell, have gained interest in recent years as potential diagnostic biomarkers in cancer. Therefore, isolation and characterization of blood and bone marrow plasma-derived EVs from pediatric AML patients could be an additional approach in AML diagnostics and disease monitoring. In this study, we attempt to establish a plasma EV-RNA-based method to detect leukemia-specific FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations using established leukemia cell lines and primary pediatric AML plasma samples. We were successfully able to detect FLT3-ITD and NPM1 mutations in the EV-RNA using GeneScan-based fragment-length analysis and real-time PCR assays, respectively, in samples before therapy. This was corresponding to the gDNA mutational analysis from leukemic blasts, and supports the potential of using EV-RNA as a diagnostic biomarker in pediatric AML."
30673723,"The development of a sterilizing vaccine against malaria remains one of the highest priorities for global health research. While sporozoite vaccines targeting the pre-erythrocytic stage show great promise, it has not been possible to maintain efficacy long-term, likely due to an inability of these vaccines to maintain effector memory T cell responses in the liver. Vaccines based on human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) might overcome this limitation since vectors based on rhesus CMV (RhCMV), the homologous virus in rhesus macaques (RM), elicit and indefinitely maintain high frequency, non-exhausted effector memory T cells in extralymphoid tissues, including the liver. Moreover, RhCMV strain 68-1 elicits CD8+ T cells broadly recognizing unconventional epitopes exclusively restricted by MHC-II and MHC-E. To evaluate the potential of these unique immune responses to protect against malaria, we expressed four Plasmodium knowlesi (Pk) antigens (CSP, AMA1, SSP2/TRAP, MSP1c) in RhCMV 68-1 or in Rh189-deleted 68-1, which additionally elicits canonical MHC-Ia-restricted CD8+ T cells. Upon inoculation of RM with either of these Pk Ag expressing RhCMV vaccines, we obtained T cell responses to each of the four Pk antigens. Upon challenge with Pk sporozoites we observed a delayed appearance of blood stage parasites in vaccinated RM consistent with a 75-80% reduction of parasite release from the liver. Moreover, the Rh189-deleted RhCMV/Pk vectors elicited sterile protection in one RM. Once in the blood, parasite growth was not affected. In contrast to T cell responses induced by Pk infection, RhCMV vectors maintained sustained T cell responses to all four malaria antigens in the liver post-challenge. The delayed appearance of blood stage parasites is thus likely due to a T cell-mediated inhibition of liver stage parasite development. As such, this vaccine approach can be used to efficiently test new T cell antigens, improve current vaccines targeting the liver stage and complement vaccines targeting erythrocytic antigens."
30673691,"BACKGROUND An extensive body of research reveals the clinical value of serum tumor markers in lung cancer patients, including carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA), cytokeratin-19 fragments (Cyfra21-1), and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), but little is known about the clinical properties of these serum tumor markers in anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive lung cancer patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS We retrospectively analyzed 54 patients harboring ALK rearrangements and 520 patients without ALK rearrangements, and all these patients were treated exclusively by surgery between 2011 and 2016. RESULTS NSE level (P=0.007 for OS) was identified as an independent prognostic factor among patients with resected ALK-positive adenocarcinoma of the lung. CONCLUSIONS A high level of NSE is associated with worse outcome among resected lung adenocarcinoma patients harboring ALK rearrangements."
30673631,"The relationship between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and aging, as well as the antiaging effects of BMSCs, was observed. An aging macaque BMSC model was established. We isolated BMSCs from young and aged macaques and used RT-PCR and Western blot to confirm the aging-related mRNAs and their expression, revealing that TERT, SIRT1 and SIRT6 expression was decreased in the aged BMSCs. The morphology, immunophenotype, differentiation potential, proliferation potential, and antiaging effects of aged and young BMSCs on 293T cells were compared. The expression of aging-related genes and the difference between the secreted cytokines in natural aging and induced aging BMSCs were observed. The transcriptome of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from macaques was analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Finally, the transcriptional characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of gene transcription in aging macaques were investigated."
30673612,"Targeted cancer therapeutics select for drug-resistant rescue subclones (RSCs), which typically carry rescue mutations that restore oncogenic signaling. Whereas mutations underlying antibiotic resistance frequently burden drug-naive microbes with a fitness cost, it remains unknown whether and how rescue mutations underlying cancer relapse encounter negative selection prior to targeted therapy. Here, using mouse models of reversible, Wnt-driven mammary cancer, we uncovered stringent counter-selection against Wnt signaling overdose during the clonal evolution of RSCs. Analyzing recurrent tumors emerging during simulated targeted therapy (Wnt withdrawal) by multi-region DNA sequencing revealed polyclonal relapses comprised of multiple RSCs, which bear distinct but functionally equivalent rescue mutations that converge on sub-maximal Wnt pathway activation. When superimposed on native (i.e., undrugged) signaling, these rescue mutations faced negative selection, indicating that they burden RSCs with a fitness cost before Wnt withdrawal unmasks their selective advantage. Exploiting collateral sensitivity to oncogene overdose may help eliminate RSCs and prevent cancer relapse."
30673117,"In the era of personalised medicine, genetic information is critical to directing therapeutic options, aiding risk stratification and disease monitoring of lymphomas. Liquid biopsy is a novel noninvasive, real-time and tumour-specific technique, reliably reflecting the comprehensive tumour genetic profile, and thus holds great promise for the genetic assessment, response monitoring and relapse detection of lymphomas. Standard methods for disease response assessment in patients with lymphoma, including positron emission tomography, are imperfect. In other haematological malignancies, particularly leukaemias, the ability to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) is increasingly influencing treatment paradigms. However, in some subtypes of lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma, the application of MRD assessment techniques such as flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction-based methods has been challenged by the absence of circulating disease. The review summarises the applications of liquid biopsy in the assessment of tumour burden and response to therapy, noninvasive genomic profiling, and monitoring of clonal dynamics in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and classic Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma."

30672438,"Acquired drug resistance is one of the main limitations in pharmacological therapy of malignancies including gastric cancer. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small noncoding RNAs that suppress their targets by binding to the 3'UTR region of genes. In this study, we explored investigate the target gene of miR-494 and its roles in chemoresistance of gastric cancer. We found that miR-494 was significantly down-regulated in gastric cancer cells lines compared to the normal gastric epithelial cell line. Exogenous overexpression of miR-494 increased the chemosensitivity of gastric cancer cells to doxorubicin. Moreover, miR-494 expression was reduced in a doxorubicin-resistant gastric cancer cells (AGS/dox) compared with the parental cells. MTT assay showed that AGS/dox cells exhibited an elevated viability compared with the parental cells. Enforced expression of miR-494 inhibited AGS/dox cell viability and colony formation ability. In addition, we demonstrated that elevated expression of miR-494 inhibited the mRNA and protein expression of phosphodiesterases 4D (PDE4D) in gastric cancer cell. Luciferase assay showed that miR-494 directly targeted the 3'UTR region of PDE4D. Furthermore, restoration of PDE4D recovered the chemoresistance in miR-494-overexpressed gastric cancer cells. Taken together, this study demonstrated that miR-494 enhanced doxorubicin sensitivity via regulation of PDE4D expression, suggesting a novel therapeutic strategy for anti-chemoresistance in gastric cancer."
30672433,"Burn wound infection by A. baumannii is one of the predominant cause of mortality worldwide. The present investigation aimed at determination of antimicrobial resistance profile and expression of the biofilm-related genes in A. baumannii isolated from hospitalized patients with burn wound infection in Kermanshah hospitals. Sixty four isolates of A. baumannii were recovered from burn wound of hospitalized patients at hospitals in Kermanshah. The antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) was performed. Biofilm formation was measured and antibiotic resistance was compared between before and after of biofilm formation. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Real-Time PCR were performed to detect of abaI and pgaD genes. The biofilm producer isolates and the most resistant isolates were exposed to ozone gas .More than 70% strains were resistance to Erythromycin, Ofloxacin, Ceftazidime, Ceftriaxone, and Ticarcillin-clavulanic acid and 50% isolates were resistant to Imipenem. Thirty one (48.4%) isolates were biofilm producer. The pgaD and abaI genes were positive in 29 (45.3%) and 9 (14%) isolates, respectively. Real time PCR demonstrated that the copy numbers of the pgaD and abaI genes after biofilm formation were increased. After exposure to ozone, biofilm formation reduced in all very strong biofilm producing isolates. Our results showed that after biofilm formation, an increased resistance was observed in most isolates. Also rising expression of abaI gene was associated with biofilm formation and an increase of antibiotic resistance. In the current study, both biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance were reduced after O3 exposure."

30672366,"After discovery and characterization of the adenovirus in the 1950s, this prevalent cause of the common cold and other usually mild diseases has been modified and utilized in biomedicine in several ways. To date, adenoviruses are the most frequently used vectors and therapeutic (e.g. oncolytic) agents with a number of beneficial features. They infect both dividing and non-dividing cells, enable high-level, transient protein expression, and are easy to amplify to high concentrations. As an important and versatile research tool, it is of essence to understand the limits and advantages that genetic modification of adenovirus vectors may entail. Therefore, we performed a retrospective analysis of around 50 different adenoviral gene therapy constructs produced in the same laboratory with similar methods. The aim was to assess the impact of various modifications on the physical and functional titer of the virus. We found that, genome size (designed within ""the 105% golden rule""), did not significantly affect the physical titer of the adenovirus preparations, regardless of the type of transgene (e.g. immunostimulatory vs other), number of engineered changes, and size of the mutated virus genome. One statistically, but probably not clinically significant exception was noted, however. Chimeric adenoviruses (5/3) had a slightly lower physical titer compared to Ad5-based viruses, although a trend for the opposite was true for functional titer. Thus, 5/3 chimeric viruses may in fact be appealing from the safety versus efficacy viewpoint. Armed viruses had lower, both functional and physical, titers than unarmed viruses, while five genomic modifications started to decrease functional titer. Importantly, even highly modified armed viruses generally had good titers compatible with clinical testing. In summary, this paper shows the plasticity of adenovirus for various vector, oncolytic, and armed oncolytic uses. These results inform future generations of adenovirus-based drugs for human use. This information is directly transferable to academic laboratories and the biomedical industry involved in vector design and production optimization."

30672150,"There is currently no cure for gene mutation-caused autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). Over half of patients with ADPKD eventually develop kidney failure, requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation. Current treatment modalities for ADPKD focus on reducing morbidity and mortality from renal and extrarenal complications of the disease. MicroRNA has been shown to be useful in treating ADPKD. This study combines anti-miRNA plasmids and iron oxide/alginate nanoparticles for conjugation with antikidney antibodies. These nanocomposites can specifically target renal tubular cells, providing a potential treatment for ADPKD. Magnetic resonance imaging and in vivo imaging system results show effective targeting of renal cells. Anti-miRNA plasmids released from the nanocomposites inhibit cell proliferation and cyst formation in the PKD cellular and animal models. The results suggest the novel combination of the anti-miRNA plasmids and nanomaterials provides potential clinical implications for ADPKD treatment."
30672100,"Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have provided great clinical benefits to ovarian cancer patients. To date, three PARP inhibitors, namely, olaparib, rucaparib and niraparib have been approved for the treatment of ovarian cancer in the United States. Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and platinum sensitivity are prospective biomarkers for predicting the response to PARP inhibitors in ovarian cancers. Preclinical data have focused on identifying the gene aberrations that might generate HRD and induce sensitivity to PARP inhibitors in vitro in cancer cell lines or in vivo in patient-derived xenografts. Clinical trials have focused on genomic scar analysis to identify biomarkers for predicting the response to PARP inhibitors. Additionally, researchers have aimed to investigate mechanisms of resistance to PARP inhibitors and strategies to overcome this resistance. Combining PARP inhibitors with HR pathway inhibitors to extend the utility of PARP inhibitors to BRCA-proficient tumours is increasingly foreseeable. Identifying the population of patients with the greatest potential benefit from PARP inhibitor therapy and the circumstances under which patients are no longer suited for PARP inhibitor therapy are important. Further studies are required in order to propose better strategies for overcoming resistance to PARP inhibitor therapy in ovarian cancers."
30672055,"The successful intracellular delivery of biologically active proteins and peptides plays an important role for therapeutic applications. Indeed, protein/ peptide delivery could overcome some problems of gene therapy, e.g., controlling the expression levels and the integration of transgene into the host cell genome. Thus, protein/ peptide drug delivery showed a promising and safe approach for treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. Due to the unique physical and chemical properties of proteins, their production (e.g., isolation, purification & formulation) and delivery represented significant challenges in pharmaceutical studies. Modification in the structural moieties of these protein/ peptide drugs could improve their solubility, stability, crystallinity, lipophilicity, enzymatic susceptibility and targetability, and subsequently, therapies and cures against various diseases. Using the structural modification of protein/ peptide, their delivery provided overall higher success rates including high specificity, high activity, bioreactivity and safety. Recently, biotechnological and pharmaceutical companies have tried to find novel techniques for the modifications and improve delivery systems/ carriers. However, each carrier has its own benefits and drawbacks, and an appropriate carrier is often established by the physicochemical properties of protein or peptide, the ideal route of injection, and clinical characteristics of therapy. In this review, an attempt was made to give an overview on the chemical carriers for proteins and peptides as well as the recent advances in this field."
30671946,"The hotspot mutation H1047R in the oncogenic PIK3CA gene is frequently detected in breast cancer and enhances the enzymatic activity of PI3K to activate AKT/mTOR signaling cascade. Aberrant elevated PI3K activation has been reported to promote the tumorigenesis of breast cancer, but the mechanisms underlying are still needed to be elucidated. Here, we found that continuously activating PIK3CA<sup>H1047R</sup> conferred human mammary epithelial MCF-10A cells to cellular senescence upon serum-starvation. Similarly, breast cancer T47D and HCC1954 cells harboring H1047R mutation were senescent when cells were deprived of serum. PI3K/AKT/mTOR axis but not p53 or RB might be required for the induction of senescence. Notably, membrane metallo-endopeptidase (MME) was identified as a downstream effector of PI3K to mediate the induction of senescence, which might be associated with its glycosylation. Senescent cells elicited a distinct secretome dependent on PI3K and MME. Specifically, IL-6 promoted the proliferation of normal cells and CCL2 induced the M2-like polarization of macrophages, which might create an immunosuppressive microenvironment during the initiation and/or development of breast cancer. This study shed new light on the tumorigenesis induced by hyper-activated PI3K and might provide new clues for the prevention and therapy of breast cancer. This article is protected by copyright.

30671931,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women worldwide. Due to its complexity in nature, effective breast cancer treatment can encounter many challenges. Traditional methods of cancer detection such as tissue biopsy are not comprehensive enough to capture the entire genomic landscape of breast tumors. However, with the introduction of novel techniques, the application of liquid biopsy has been enhanced, enabling the improvement of various aspects of breast cancer management including early diagnosis and screening, prediction of prognosis, early detection of relapse, serial sampling and efficient longitudinal monitoring of disease progress and response to treatment. Various components of tumor cells released into the blood circulation can be analyzed in liquid biopsy sampling, some of which include circulating tumor cells (CTCs), circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), cell free RNA (cfRNA), tumor-educated platelets (TEPs) and exosomes. These components can be utilized for different purposes. As an example, ctDNA can be sequenced for genetic profiling of the tumors to enhance individualized treatment and longitudinal screening. CTC plasma count analysis or ctDNA detection after curative tumor resection surgery could facilitate early detection of minimal residual disease (MRD), aiding in the initiation of adjuvant therapy to prevent recurrence. Furthermore, CTC plasma count can be assessed to determine the stage and prognosis of breast cancer. In this review, we discuss the advantages and limitations of the various components of liquid biopsy used in breast cancer diagnosis and will expand on aspects that require further focus in future research.

30671880,"Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) transplantation has shown to be effective in treating chronic kidney disease. However, the effectiveness of this strategy is constrained by low homing and survival rate of transplanted cells in the injured organs. Therefore, developing strategies to improve homing and cell survival rate and therapeutic potential in cell-based therapies seems necessary. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of pretreating BMMSCs with melatonin (MT) on the prosurvival and renoprotective of transplanted cells into the irreversible model of unilateral ureteral obstruction. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four groups: Sham, UUO, UUO + BMMSCs, and UUO + BMMSCs + MT. The results of our study demonstrated that preconditioning with MT enhanced homing of BMMSCs into the injured kidney. MT reduced the number of TUNEL positive transplanted cells in the UUO + BMMSCs + MT group. The UUO + BMMSCs + MT group showed lower expressions of TGF-β1, α-SMA and TNF-α at both gene and protein levels but higher expression of E-cadherin compared with the UUO + BMMSCs group. In addition, MT preconditioned BMMSCs ameliorated basement membrane disruption and histological status of injured renal tubules and also reduced fibrosis in damaged kidneys. In conclusion, our results show that stem cells pretreated by MT may represent a feasible approach for improving the beneficial effects of stem cell therapy and significantly enhance their survival after transplantation to the injured kidney."
30671696,"Globally, the central nervous system (CNS) disorders appear as the most critical pathological threat with no proper cure. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one such condition frequently observed with the aged population and sometimes in youth too. Most of the research utilizes different animal models for in vivo study of AD pathophysiology and to investigate the potency of the newly developed therapy. These in vivo models undoubtably provide a powerful investigation tool to study human brain. Although, it sometime fails to mimic the exact environment and responses as the human brain owing to the distinctive genetic and anatomical features of human and rodent brain. In such condition, the in vitro cell model derived from patient specific cell or human cell lines can recapitulate the human brain environment. In addition, the frequent use of animals in research increases the cost of study and creates various ethical issues. Instead, the use of in vitro cellular models along with animal models can enhance the translational values of in vivo models and represent a better and effective mean to investigate the potency of therapeutics. This strategy also limits the excessive use of laboratory animal during the drug development process. Generally, the in vitro cell lines are cultured from AD rat brain endothelial cells, the rodent models, human astrocytes, human brain capillary endothelial cells, patient derived iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells) and also from the non-neuronal cells. During the literature review process, we observed that there are very few reviews available which describe the significance and characteristics of in vitro cell lines, for AD investigation. Thus, in the present review article, we have compiled the various in vitro cell lines used in AD investigation including HBMEC, BCECs, SHSY-5Y, hCMEC/D3, PC-2 cell line, bEND3 cells, HEK293, hNPCs, RBE4 cells, SK-N-MC, BMVECs, CALU-3, 7W CHO, iPSCs and cerebral organoids cell lines and different types of culture media such as SCM, EMEM, DMEM/F12, RPMI, EBM and 3D-cell culture."

In this study, we investigated the efficiency of gene transfer by AAV-DJ injections into the retina."
30671294,"The fight against cancer has been a never-ending battle. Limitations of conventional therapies include lack of selectivity, poor penetration and highly toxic to the host. Using genetically modified bacteria as a tumour therapy agent has gained the interest of scientist from the past few decades. Low virulence and highly tolerability of <i>Salmonella</i> spp. in animals and humans make it as the most studied pathogen with regards to anti-tumour therapy. The present study aims to construct a genetically modified <i>S.</i> Agona auxotroph as an anti-tumour agent. <i>LeuB</i> and <i>ArgD</i> metabolic genes in Δ<i>SopB</i>Δ<i>SopD</i> double knockout <i>S.</i> Agona were successfully knocked out using a Targetron gene knockout system. The knockout was confirmed by colony PCR and the strains were characterized <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The knockout of metabolic genes causes significant growth defect in M9 minimal media. Quadruple knockout Δ<i>SopB</i>Δ<i>SopD</i>Δ<i>LeuB</i>Δ<i>ArgD</i> (BDLA) exhibited lowest virulence among all of the strains in all parameters including bacterial load, immunity profile and histopathology studies. <i>In vivo</i> anti-tumour study on colorectal tumour bearing-BALB/c mice revealed that all strains of <i>S.</i> Agona were able to suppress the growth of the large solid tumour as compared with negative control and Δ<i>LeuB</i>Δ<i>ArgD</i> (LA) and BDLA auxotroph showed better efficacy. Interestingly, higher level of tumour growth suppression was noticed in large tumour. However, multiple administration of bacteria dosage did not increase the tumour suppression efficacy. In this study, the virulence of BDLA knockout strain was slightly reduced and tumour growth suppression efficacy was successfully enhanced, which provide a valuable starting point for the development of <i>S.</i> Agona as anti-tumour agent."
30671208,"Sickle cell disease (SCD; ORPHA232; OMIM # 603903) is a chronic and invalidating disorder distributed worldwide, with high morbidity and mortality. Given the disease complexity and the multiplicity of pathophysiological targets, development of new therapeutic options is critical, despite the positive effects of hydroxyurea (HU), for many years the only approved drug for SCD. New therapeutic strategies might be divided into (1) pathophysiology-related novel therapies and (2) innovations in curative therapeutic options such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and gene therapy. The pathophysiology related novel therapies are: a) Agents which reduce sickling or prevent sickle red cell dehydration; b) Agents targeting SCD vasculopathy and sickle cell-endothelial adhesive events; c) Anti-oxidant agents. This review highlights new therapeutic strategies in SCD and discusses future developments, research implications, and possible innovative clinical trials."
30671136,"Upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) accounts for 5% of urothelial carcinomas (UCs), the estimated annual incidence being 1-2 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Similarly to bladder UC, divergent differentiations and histologic variants confer an adverse risk factor in comparison with pure UTUC. Molecular and genomic characterization studies on UTUC have shown changes occurring at differing frequencies from bladder cancer, with unique molecular and clinical subtypes, potentially with different responses to treatment. Systemic chemotherapy is the standard approach for patients with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic UCs. Although initial response rates are high, the median survival with combination chemotherapy is about 15 months. In first-line chemotherapy several cisplatin-based regimens have been proposed. For patients with advanced UC who progress to first-line treatment, the only product licensed in Europe is vinflunine, a third-generation, semisynthetic, vinca alkaloid. Better response rates (15-60%), with higher toxicity rates and no overall survival (OS) benefit, are generally achieved in multidrug combinations, which often include taxanes and gemcitabine. The US FDA has recently approved five agents targeting the programmed death-1 and programmed death ligand-1 pathway as a second-line therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC with disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy. Potential therapeutic targets are present in 69% of tumours analyzed. Specific molecular alterations include those involved in the RTK/Ras/PI(3)K, cell-cycle regulation and chromatin-remodeling pathways, many of them have either targeted therapies approved or under investigation. Angiogenic agents, anti-epidermal growth factor receptor therapy, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway inhibitors and immunotherapeutic drugs are being successfully investigated."
30671101,"Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among woman, worldwide, despite advances in identifying novel targeted therapies and the development of treating strategies. Classification of clinical subtypes (ER+, PR+, HER2+, and TNBC (Triple-negative)) increases the complexity of breast cancers, which thus necessitates further investigation. Mouse models used in breast cancer research provide an essential approach to examine the mechanisms and genetic pathway in cancer progression and metastasis and to develop and evaluate clinical therapeutics. In this review, we summarize tumor transplantation models and genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of breast cancer and their applications in the field of human breast cancer research and anti-cancer drug development. These models may help to improve the knowledge of underlying mechanisms and genetic pathways, as well as creating approaches for modeling clinical tumor subtypes, and developing innovative cancer therapy."
30670828,"Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is a genetic disease caused by mutations in the ATM gene but the mechanisms underlying AT are not completely understood. Key functions of the ATM protein are to sense and regulate cellular redox status and to transduce DNA double-strand break signals to downstream effectors. ATM-deficient cells show increased ROS accumulation, activation of p38 protein kinase, and increased levels of DNA damage. GSE24.2 peptide and a short derivative GSE4 peptide corresponding to an internal domain of Dyskerin have proved to induce telomerase activity, decrease oxidative stress, and protect from DNA damage in dyskeratosis congenita (DC) cells. We have found that expression of GSE24.2 and GSE4 in human AT fibroblast is able to decrease DNA damage, detected by γ-H2A.X and 53BP1 foci. However, GSE24.2/GSE4 expression does not improve double-strand break signaling and repair caused by the lack of ATM activity. In contrast, they cause a decrease in 8-oxoguanine and OGG1-derived lesions, particularly at telomeres and mitochondrial DNA, as well as in reactive oxygen species, in parallel with increased expression of SOD1. These cells also showed lower levels of IL6 and decreased p38 phosphorylation, decreased senescence and increased ability to divide for longer times. Additionally, these cells are more resistant to treatment with H<sub>2</sub>0<sub>2</sub> and the radiomimetic-drug bleomycin. Finally, we found shorter telomere length (TL) in AT cells, lower levels of TERT expression, and telomerase activity that were also partially reverted by GSE4. These observations suggest that GSE4 may be considered as a new therapy for the treatment of AT that counteracts the cellular effects of high ROS levels generated in AT cells and in addition increases telomerase activity contributing to increased cell proliferation."

30670791,"Angiosarcoma is a deadly neoplasm of the vascular endothelium. Metastatic disease is often present at diagnosis, and 5-year survival is only 10-35%. Although there exist no immunocompetent mouse models of angiosarcoma with which to study immune-based approaches to therapy, angiosarcoma is a major killer of companion dogs, responsible for up to 2% of all canine deaths in some susceptible breeds or an estimated 120,000 per year in the US. The canine disease (HSA) often presents in the spleen as acute hemoabdomen secondary to splenic rupture. Even if life-saving splenectomy is performed, median overall survival (OS) is only 48 days, and 1-year survival is negligible. Here we report the analysis of a pilot phase I open-label trial of chemo-immunotherapy performed on consecutively presenting splenectomized canines with histologically verified HSA. Subjects received an abbreviated course of low-dose doxorubicin plus alpha interferon and an autologous dendritic cell-therapy reported to enhance durable CD8<sup>+</sup> memory. Disease was monitored monthly by abdominal ultrasound, chest X-ray, and echocardiogram. Median OS in the per protocol population was 109 days including one of five animals that died cancer-free at 16 months after documented resolution of relapsed disease. These results indicate that therapeutic administration of chemo-immunotherapy is both feasible and safe, substantiating the rationale for additional veterinary and human clinical studies."
30670701,"Fifty percent of inner ear disorders are caused by genetic mutations. To develop treatments for genetic inner ear disorders, we designed gene replacement therapies using synthetic adeno-associated viral vectors to deliver the coding sequence for Transmembrane Channel-Like (Tmc) 1 or 2 into sensory hair cells of mice with hearing and balance deficits due to mutations in Tmc1 and closely related Tmc2. Here we report restoration of function in inner and outer hair cells, enhanced hair cell survival, restoration of cochlear and vestibular function, restoration of neural responses in auditory cortex and recovery of behavioral responses to auditory and vestibular stimulation. Secondarily, we find that inner ear Tmc gene therapy restores breeding efficiency, litter survival and normal growth rates in mouse models of genetic inner ear dysfunction. Although challenges remain, the data suggest that Tmc gene therapy may be well suited for further development and perhaps translation to clinical application."
30670657,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has a dismal prognosis, and survival benefits of recent multimodality treatments remain small. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are known to contribute to poor outcome by conferring therapy resistance to various cancer types, but this has not been explored in EAC. Importantly, a targeted strategy to circumvent CAF-induced resistance has yet to be identified. By using EAC patient-derived CAFs, organoid cultures, and xenograft models we identified IL-6 as the stromal driver of therapy resistance in EAC. IL-6 activated epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in cancer cells, which was accompanied by enhanced treatment resistance, migratory capacity, and clonogenicity. Inhibition of IL-6 restored drug sensitivity in patient-derived organoid cultures and cell lines. Analysis of patient gene expression profiles identified ADAM12 as a noninflammation-related serum-borne marker for IL-6-producing CAFs, and serum levels of this marker predicted unfavorable responses to neoadjuvant chemoradiation in EAC patients. These results demonstrate a stromal contribution to therapy resistance in EAC. This signaling can be targeted to resensitize EAC to therapy, and its activity can be measured using serum-borne markers."
30670634,"Genetic approaches to cancer research have dramatically advanced our understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease, leading to similar genetics-based approaches for precision therapy, which have been less successful.

30670569,"Ring sideroblasts are a hallmark of sideroblastic anemia, though little is known about their characteristics. Here, we first generated mutant mice by disrupting the GATA-1 binding motif at the intron 1 enhancer of the <i>ALAS2</i> gene, a gene responsible for X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA). Although heterozygous female mice showed an anemic phenotype, ring sideroblasts were not observed in their bone marrow. Next, we established human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived proerythroblast (HiDEP) clones harboring the same <i>ALAS2</i> gene mutation. Through coculture with sodium ferrous citrate (SFC), mutant clones differentiated into mature erythroblasts and became ring sideroblasts with upregulation of metal transporters (<i>MFRN1</i>, <i>ZIP8</i>, and <i>DMT1</i>), suggesting a key role for ferrous iron in erythroid differentiation. Interestingly, holo-transferrin (holo-Tf) did not induce erythroid differentiation as well as ring sideroblast formation, and mutant cells underwent apoptosis. Despite massive iron granule content, ring sideroblasts were less apoptotic than holo-Tf-treated undifferentiated cells. Microarray analysis revealed upregulation of antiapoptotic genes in ring sideroblasts, a profile partly shared with erythroblasts from a patient with XLSA. These results suggest that ring sideroblasts exert a reaction to avoid cell death by activating antiapoptotic programs. Our model may become an important tool to clarify the pathophysiology of sideroblastic anemia."
30670492,"Both EGFR and PI3K-Akt signalling pathway have been used as therapeutically actionable targets, but resistance is frequently reported.

30670336,"With advances in multimodality therapy, childhood cancer cure rates approach 80%. However, both radiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause debilitating or even fatal late adverse events that are critical to understand, mitigate or prevent. QUANTEC (Quantitative Analysis of Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) identified radiation dose constraints for normal tissues in adults and pointed out the uncertainties in those constraints. The range of adverse events seen in children is different from that in adults, in part due to the vulnerability/characteristics of radiation damage to developing tissues, and in part due to the typical body sites affected by childhood cancer that lead to collateral irradiation of somewhat different normal tissues and organs compared with adults. Many childhood cancer survivors have a long life expectancy and may develop treatment-induced secondary cancers and severe organ/tissue injury 10, 20 or more years after treatment. Collaborative long-term observational studies and clinical research programmes for survivors of paediatric and adolescent cancer provide adverse event data for follow-up periods exceeding 40 years. Data analysis is challenging due to the interaction between therapeutic and developmental variables, the lack of radiation dose-volume data and the fact that most childhood malignancies are managed with combined modality therapy. PENTEC (Pediatric Normal Tissue Effects in the Clinic) is a volunteer research collaboration of more than 150 physicians, medical physicists, mathematical modellers and epidemiologists organised into 18 organ-specific working groups conducting a critical review and synthesis of quantitative data from existing studies aiming to: (1) establish quantitative, evidence-based dose/volume/risk guidelines to inform radiation treatment planning and, in turn, improve outcomes after radiation therapy for childhood cancers; (2) explore the most relevant risk factors for toxicity, including developmental status; (3) describe specific physics and dosimetric issues relevant to paediatric radiotherapy; and (4) propose dose-volume outcome reporting standards for publications on childhood cancer therapy outcomes. The impact of other critical modifiers of normal tissue radiation damage, including chemotherapy, surgery, stem cell transplantation and underlying genetic predispositions are also considered. The aims of the PENTEC reports are to provide clinicians with an analysis of the best available data to make informed decisions regarding radiation therapy normal organ dose constraints for planning childhood cancer treatment, and to define future research priorities."

30670058,"Tumour hypoxia is a driver of breast cancer progression associated with worse prognosis and more aggressive disease. The cellular response to hypoxia is mediated by the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2, whose transcriptional activity is canonically regulated through their oxygen-labile HIF-α subunits. These are constitutively degraded in the presence of oxygen; however, HIF-1α can be stabilised, even at high oxygen concentrations, through the activation of HER receptor signalling. Despite this, there is still limited understanding on how HER receptor signalling interacts with HIF activity to contribute to breast cancer progression in the context of tumour hypoxia."
30669933,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a new arm of gene regulatory mechanism as discovered by sequencing techniques and follow-up functional studies. There are only few studies on lncRNAs as related to gene expression regulation and anti-viral activity during influenza virus infection. We sought to identify and characterize lncRNAs involved in influenza virus replication. Using RNA sequencing analysis, we found that 1,912 lncRNAs were significantly changed in human lung epithelial A549 cells infected with influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34. Gene ontology analysis on neighboring genes of these lncRNAs revealed that the genes involved in type I interferon signaling and cellular response were highly enriched. Seven selected up-regulated lncRNAs (AC015849.2, RP-1-7H24.1, PSMB8-AS1, CTD-2639E6.9, PSOR1C3, AC007283.5 and RP11-670E13.5) were verified by real-time PCR. These lncRNAs were also induced by other two influenza H1N1 virus strains (A/WSN/1933 and A/Oklahoma/3052/09) and interferon β1. Repression of PSMB8 antisense RNA 1 (PSMB8-AS1) using CRISPR interference reduced viral mRNA and protein levels as well as the release of progeny influenza virus particles. Our study suggests that lncRNA PSMB8-AS1 could be a new host factor target for developing antiviral therapy against influenza virus infection."
30669818,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects around 71 million people worldwide and in 2018 it is still a major health problem. Since 2011, anti-HCV therapy with availability of direct-acting antiviral drugs has revolutionized the clinical response and paved the way to eradication strategies. However, despite the high rate of sustained virological response, treatment failure may occur in a limited percentage of patients, possibly due to resistance-associated substitutions (RASs), either emergent or pre-existent even in minority viral populations. Clearly this problem may impair success of eradication strategies. With this background, several questions marks still exist around HCV treatment, including whether pan-genotypic treatments with complete effectiveness in any clinical conditions really exist outside clinical trials, the actual cost-effectiveness of genotyping testing, and utility of RAS detection in viral quasispecies by next generation sequencing approach. In this review, we describe these critical points by discussing recent literature data and our research experience."
30669787,"<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of DCV-based DAAs therapy for chronic HCV infected Chinese patients. <b>Methods:</b> An open-label, non-randomized, prospective study was designed. Fifty-two patients with chronic HCV infection were enrolled. Among them, there was one patient after liver transplantation, 2 patients after kidney transplantation, 3 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, and 4 patients with HBV infection. Thirteen cases with chronic hepatitis C (one compensated cirrhosis) who were negative for resistance-related variants [NS5A RAS (-)] of gene 1b and NS5A were treated with daclatasvir (DCV) + asunaprevir (ASV) for 24 weeks. Twenty-five cases of CHC (six compensated cirrhosis) with GT 1b, 2a, 3a, 3b, 6a were treated with DCV + SOF ± RBV for 24 weeks. 8 cases with decompensated cirrhosis of gene 1b and NS5A RAS(-) were given DCV + SOF + RBV regimen for 12 weeks. Six cases with decompensated cirrhosis, of gene 2a, 1b, 2a, 3a, 3b, were given DCV + SOF + RBV regimen for 24 weeks. HCV RNA, blood routine test, liver and kidney function, and upper abdominal ultrasound/MRI were measured at baseline, 4 weeks of treatment, end of treatment, and 12 weeks of follow-up. The incidence of adverse events and laboratory abnormalities during treatment were recorded. A t-test was used to compare the measurement data between two groups, and analysis of variance was used to compare the measurement data between multiple groups. <b>Results:</b> Sixteen patients (100%) achieved SVR12 after treatment, with 0% recurrence rate. Rapid virological response (RVR) of the four treatment regimens were 76.92%, 54.17%, 87.50%, and 83.33%, respectively, and 32 patients achieved 100% virological response after the completion of treatment. The incidence of adverse events of chronic hepatitis C with cirrhosis and decompensated cirrhosis was 62.5% and 64.29%, respectively. The most common adverse event was fatigue in CHC (25.00%), and elevated indirect bilirubin in decompensated cirrhosis (42.86%). No serious adverse drug events, deaths or adverse reactions occurred. <b>Conclusion:</b> DCV-based DAAs regimen is promising option for the treatment of HCV genotypes, compensated cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and HCV infection after liver/kidney transplantation in china. Above all, it has high SVR12 with good tolerability and safety profile."
30669747,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the clinical outcomes of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated by apatinib regimens and the influence of VEGFR2-906T>C polymorphism. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 109 patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated by apatinib after three and more lines from March 2015 to December 2017 in the Department of Oncology of the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University were included in this study. Overall response rates were evaluated after 2 cycles, then progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were investigated, and safety data were recorded. Additionally, peripheral blood and the biopsy tissue specimens of some NSCLC patients were collected for the genotyping of genetic variation and VEGFR2 gene mRNA expression, respectively. The association between genotype and other characteristics and VEGFR2 gene mRNA expression were analyzed. The univariate analysis of genotypes and prognosis was carried out by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and multivariate analysis were adjusted by Cox regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> The treatment effect could be evaluated in all the 109 patients, among them, complete remission (CR) 0 case, partial remission (PR) 19 case, stable disease (SD) 58 case, progression disease (PD) 32 case. Overall response rate (ORR) was 17.43%, disease control rate (DCR) was 70.64%, median PFS was 4.35 months, median OS was 8.35 months. Of the polymorphisms analyzed, only -906T>C was of clinical significance. The prevalence of -906T>C in VEGFR2 among the study population were as follows: TT genotype 64 cases (58.72%), TC genotype 37 cases (33.94%), CC genotype 8 cases (7.34%), minor allele frequency of -906T>C was 0.24. The distribution of three genotypes was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (<i>P=</i>0.418). CC and TC genotype patients were merged in the comparison of clinical outcomes. The analysis of patients with different genotypes found that the ORR of CC/TC genotypes and TT genotypes were 13.33% and 20.31% (<i>P=</i>0.377), respectively. And the median PFS of patients with CC/TC genotype and TT genotype were 3.25 and 5.35 months, respectively, which was statistically significant (<i>P=</i>0.007). In terms of OS, the median OS of the two genotypes were 7.35 and 9.15 (<i>P=</i>0.014), respectively. Adjusted in multivariate Cox regression analysis of PFS, TC/CC genotypes were an independent factor for PFS (<i>OR=</i>1.83, <i>P=</i>0.015). The correlation between -906T>C and adverse reactions was not found in the safety analysis. Additionally, of the 69 biopsy tissue specimens, gene expression analysis was conducted. And the results show that the mRNA expression of VEGFR2 in cancer tissues of the patients with CC/TC genotypes were significantly higher than those of the TT genotype patients (<i>P<</i>0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Apatinib is safe and effective for patients with advanced non-small cell in multiline therapy. VEGFR2 -906T>C CC/TC genotype has a worse effect on apatinib multiline treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC."
30669662,"Nivolumab is one of the most commonly used monoclonal antibodies for advanced non-small cell lung cancer treatment, to the extent that the presence of its anti-antibody is considered a negative prognostic factor. Vitamin D (VD) modulates expression of the genes involved in drug metabolism and elimination. Immune system regulation and immunodeficiency is frequent in non-small cell lung cancer patients. To date, no data have been reported about the relationship between nivolumab and VD. The aim of this study was to quantify plasma 25-hydroxyVD (25-VD) and 1,25-VD, nivolumab, and its anti-antibody before starting treatment (baseline) and at 15, 45 and 60 days of therapy. VD-pathway-associated gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were also evaluated. Molecules were quantified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and SNPs through real-time PCR. Forty-five patients were enrolled. Median nivolumab concentrations were 12.5 ug/mL, 22.3 ug/mL and 27.1 ug/mL at 15, 45 and 60 days respectively. No anti-nivolumab antibodies were found. Correlations were observed between nivolumab concentrations and 25-VD levels. Nivolumab concentrations were affected by VD-pathway-related gene SNPs. <i>VDBP</i> AC/CC genotype and baseline 25-VD < 10 ng/mL predicted a nivolumab concentration cut-off value of <18.7ug/mL at 15 days, which was associated with tumor progression. This is the first study showing VD marker predictors of nivolumab concentrations in a real-life context of non-small cell lung cancer treatment."
30669647,"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) sequencing can identify resistance mechanisms and guide next-line therapy in ALK+ non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the clinical significance of other rebiopsy findings remains unclear. We analysed all stage-IV ALK+ NSCLC patients with longitudinally assessable TP53 status treated in our institutions (n = 62). Patients with TP53 mutations at baseline (TP53mutbas, n = 23) had worse overall survival (OS) than patients with initially wild-type tumours (TP53wtbas, n = 39, 44 vs. 62 months in median, p = 0.018). Within the generally favourable TP53wtbas group, detection of TP53 mutations at progression defined a ""converted"" subgroup (TP53mutconv, n = 9) with inferior OS, similar to that of TP53mutbas and shorter than that of patients remaining TP53 wild-type (TP53wtprogr, 45 vs. 94 months, p = 0.043). Progression-free survival (PFS) under treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) for TP53mutconv was comparable to that of TP53mutbas and also shorter than that of TP53wtprogr cases (5 and 8 vs. 13 months, p = 0.0039). Fewer TP53wtprogr than TP53mutbas or TP53mutconv cases presented with metastatic disease at diagnosis (67% vs. 91% or 100%, p < 0.05). Thus, acquisition of TP53 mutations at progression is associated with more aggressive disease, shorter TKI responses and inferior OS in ALK+ NSCLC, comparable to primary TP53 mutated cases."
30669514,"Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynecological cancer. It is initially responsive to cisplatin and carboplatin, two DNA damaging agents used in first line therapy. However, almost invariably, patients relapse with a tumor resistant to subsequent treatment with platinum containing drugs. Several mechanisms associated with the development of acquired drug resistance have been reported. Here we focused our attention on DNA repair mechanisms, which are fundamental for recognition and removal of platinum adducts and hence for the ability of these drugs to exert their activity. We analyzed the major DNA repair pathways potentially involved in drug resistance, detailing gene mutation, duplication or deletion as well as polymorphisms as potential biomarkers for drug resistance development. We dissected potential ways to overcome DNA repair-associated drug resistance thanks to the development of new combinations and/or drugs directly targeting DNA repair proteins or taking advantage of the vulnerability arising from DNA repair defects in EOCs."
30669483,"Malignant mesothelioma (MMe) is a cancer with poor prognosis and resistance to standard treatments. Recent reports have highlighted the role of the <i>BRCA1 associated protein 1 gene</i> (<i>BAP1</i>) in the development of MMe. In this study, the chemosensitivity of human mesothelioma cell lines carrying <i>BAP1</i> wild-type (WT), mutant and silenced was analysed. The <i>BAP1</i> mutant cells were significantly less sensitive than <i>BAP1</i> WT cell lines to the clinically relevant drug gemcitabine. Silencing of <i>BAP1</i> significantly increased resistance of MMe cells to gemcitabine. Cell cycle analysis suggested that gemcitabine induced Sub-G1 phase accumulation of the <i>BAP1</i> WT cells and increased in the S-phase in both <i>BAP1</i> WT and mutant cells. Analysis of the role of BAP1 in apoptosis suggested that gemcitabine induced early apoptosis in both <i>BAP1</i> WT and <i>BAP1</i> mutant cells but with a much higher degree in the WT cells. Effects on the population of cells in late apoptosis, which can mark necrosis and necroptosis, could not be seen in the mutant cells, highlighting the possibility that BAP1 plays a role in several types of cell death. Significantly decreased DNA damage in the form of double-strand breaks was observed in gemcitabine-treated <i>BAP1</i> mutant cells, compared to <i>BAP1</i> WT cells under the same conditions. After <i>BAP1</i> silencing, a significant decrease in DNA damage in the form of double-strand breaks was observed compared to cells transfected with scramble siRNA. Taken together, the results presented in this manuscript shed light on the role of BAP1 in the response of MMe cells to gemcitabine treatment and in particular in the control of the DNA damage response, therefore providing a potential route for more efficient MMe therapy."
30668814,"A feature of glioblastoma (GBM) is cellular and molecular heterogeneity, both within and between tumors. This variability causes a risk for sampling bias and potential tumor escape from future targeted therapy. Heterogeneous intra-tumor gene expression in GBM is well documented, but little is known regarding the epigenetic heterogeneity. Variability in DNA methylation within tumors would have implications for diagnostics, as methylation can be used for tumor classification, subtyping and determination of the clinically used biomarker MGMT promoter methylation. We therefore aimed to profile the intra-tumor DNA methylation heterogeneity in GBM and its effect on diagnostic properties."
30668709,"The role of comparative oncology in translational research is receiving increasing attention from drug developers and the greater biomedical research community. Pet dogs with spontaneous cancer are important and underutilized translational models, owing to dogs' large size and relative outbreeding, combined with their high incidence of certain tumor histotypes with significant biological, genetic, and histological similarities to their human tumor counterparts. Dogs with spontaneous tumors naturally develop therapy resistance and spontaneous metastasis, all in the context of an intact immune system. These fundamental features of cancer biology are often lacking in induced or genetically engineered preclinical tumor models and likely contribute to their poor predictive value and the associated overall high failure rate in oncology drug development. Thus, the conduct of clinical trials in pet dogs with naturally occurring cancer represents a viable surrogate and valuable intermediary step that should be increasingly incorporated into the cancer drug discovery and development pipeline. The development of molecular-targeted therapies has resulted in an expanded role of the pathologist in human oncology trials, and similarly the expertise of veterinary pathologists will be increasingly valuable to all phases of comparative oncology trial design and conduct. In this review, we provide a framework of clinical, ethical, and pathology-focused considerations for the increasing integration of translational research investigations in dogs with spontaneous cancer as a means to accelerate clinical cancer discovery and drug development."
30668686,"In presently licensed vaccines, killed or attenuated organisms act as a source of immunogens except for peptide-based vaccines. These conventional vaccines required a mass culture of associated or related organisms and long incubation periods. Special requirements during storage and transportation further add to the cost of vaccine preparations. Availability of complete genome sequence, well established genetic, inherent natural adjuvant, and nonpathogenic nature of yeast species viz Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pichia pastoris makes them an ideal model system for the development of vaccines both for public health and for on-farm consumption. In this review, we compile the work in this emerging field during last two decades with major emphases on S. cerevisiae and P. pastoris which are routinely used worldwide for expression of heterologous proteins with therapeutic value against infectious diseases along with possible use in cancer therapy. We also pointed towards the developments in use of whole recombinant yeast (WRY), yeast surface display (YSD) and virus-like particles (VLPs) as a novel strategy in the fight against infectious diseases and cancer along with other aspects including suitability of yeast in vaccine preparations, yeast cell wall component as an immune stimulator or modulator and present status of yeast-based vaccines in clinical trials."
30668646,"Altered flux through major metabolic pathways is a hallmark of cancer cells and provides opportunities for therapy. Stem cell-like cancer (SCLC) cells can cause metastasis and therapy resistance. They possess metabolic plasticity, theoretically enabling resistance to therapies targeting a specific metabolic state. The C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) transcriptional regulators are potential therapeutic targets in highly glycolytic cancer cells, as they are activated by the glycolytic coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). However, SCLC cells commonly exist in an oxidative state with low rates of glycolysis. Metformin inhibits complex I of the mitochondrial electron transport chain; it can kill oxidative SCLC cells and has anti-cancer activity in patients. SCLC cells can acquire resistance to metformin through increased glycolysis. Given the potential for long-term metformin therapy, we have studied acquired metformin resistance in cells from the claudin-low subtype of breast cancer. Cells cultured for 8 weeks in sub-IC50 metformin concentration proliferated comparably to untreated cells and exhibited higher rates of glucose uptake. SCLC cells were enriched in metformin-adapted cultures. These SCLC cells acquired sensitivity to multiple methods of inhibition of CtBP function, including a cyclic peptide inhibitor of NADH-induced CtBP dimerization. Single-cell mRNA sequencing identified a reprogramming of epithelial-mesenchymal and stem cell gene expression in the metformin-adapted SCLC cells. These SCLC cells demonstrated an acquired dependency on one of these genes, Tenascin C. Thus, in addition to acquisition of sensitivity to glycolysis-targeting therapeutic strategies, the reprograming of gene expression in the metformin-adapted SCLC cells renders them sensitive to potential therapeutic approaches not directly linked to cell metabolism."
30668579,"Phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) deficiency is responsible for most cases of phenylketonuria (PKU). Furthermore, numerous studies on BH4-sensitive PAH deficiency have been conducted. To date, BH4, a cofactor of PAH, has not been used to treat PKU in Russia.Genotype data of patients with PKU can be used to predict their sensitivity to BH4 therapy. A cohort of 2579 patients with PKU from Russia was analyzed for 25 common PAH gene mutations using custom allele-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification-based technology. A mutation detection rate of 84.1% chromosomes was accomplished. Both pathogenic alleles were identified in 73.1% of patients. The most frequent pathogenic variants were p.Arg408Trp (50.9%), p.Arg261Gln (5.3%), p.Pro281Leu (3.5%), IVS12+1G>A (3.1%), IVS10-11G>A (2.6%), and p.Arg158Leu (2.4%). The exact boundaries of a PAH exon 5 deletion were defined as EX5del4154ins268 (c.442-2913_509+1173del4154ins268). Severe phenotypes prevailed in the cohort, and classical PKU was observed in 71.8% cases. Due to the genotype-based prediction, 55.9% of the probands were non-responders to the BH4-treatment, and 20.2% were potential responders. Analysis of genotype data is useful to predict BH4 response in PKU patients. The high rate of non-responders among Russian patients was due to the high allele frequency of severe PAH mutations."
30668566,"We determined if HIV-1 expression in transgenic (HIV-1-Tg) rats enhanced hepatic genomic changes related to oxidative/nitrosative stress and lipogenesis during cART-treatment, and assessed effects of Mg-supplementation. A clinically used cART (atazanavir-ritonavir+Truvada) was given orally to control and HIV-1-Tg rats (18 weeks) with normal or 6-fold dietary-Mg. Oxidative/nitrosative and lipogenic genes were determined by real-time RT-PCR. cART induced a 4-fold upregulation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) in HIV-1-Tg-rats, but not in controls; Tg rats displayed a 2.5-fold higher expression. Both were completely prevented by Mg-supplementation. Nrf2 (Nuclear erythroid-derived factor 2), a master transcription factor controlling redox homeostasis, was down-regulated 50% in HIV-Tg rats, and reduced further to 25% in Tg+cART-rats. Two downstream antioxidant genes, heme oxygenase-1(HmOX1) and Glutathione-S-transferase(GST), were elevated in HIV-Tg alone but were suppressed by cART treatment. Decreased Nrf2 in Tg±cART were normalized by Mg-supplementation along with the reversal of altered HmOX1 and GST expression. Concomitantly, iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) was upregulated 2-fold in Tg+cART rats, which was reversed by Mg-supplementation. In parallel, cART-treatment led to substantial increases in plasma 8-isoprostane, nitrotyrosine, and RBC-GSSG (oxidized glutathione) levels in HIV-1-Tg rats; all indices of oxidative/nitrosative stress were suppressed by Mg-supplementation. Both plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels were elevated in Tg+cART rats, but were lowered by Mg-supplementation. Thus, the synergistic effects of cART and HIV-1 expression on lipogenic and oxidative/nitrosative effects were revealed at the genomic and biochemical levels. Down-regulation of Nrf2 in the Tg+cART rats suggested their antioxidant response was severely compromised; these abnormal metabolic and oxidative stress effects were effectively attenuated by Mg-supplementation at the genomic level."
30668544,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are known to affect the occurrence and progression of cancer. We therefore evaluated the involvement of miR-223-3p in renal cell cancer. MiR-223-3p was highly expressed in clear cell renal cell cancer tissues. Clear cell renal cell cancer patients with higher miR-223-3p expression had higher tumor stages and grades and poorer prognoses. In renal cancer cells, overexpression of miR-223-3p enhanced cell proliferation and metastasis, while inhibition of miR-223-3p reduced the malignant capacity of the cells. MiR-223-3p was found to bind directly to solute carrier family 4, member 4 (<i>SLC4A4</i>) mRNA, thereby reducing SLC4A4 mRNA and protein expression. SLC4A4 overexpression restrained cell proliferation and metastasis by suppressing Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene (KRAS) expression in renal cancer cells. <i>SLC4A4</i> expression correlated negatively with miR-223-3p expression in patient samples. Given that miR-223-3p suppressed the SLC4A4/KRAS axis, miR-223-3p gene therapy could be an effective treatment for renal cancer."

30668344,"Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder associated with persistent increased level of glucose in the blood. According to a report by World Health Organisation (WHO), prevalence of diabetes among adults over 18 years of age had reached to 8.5% in year 2014 which was 4.7% in 1980s. The Prolong increased level of glucose in blood leads to development of microvascular (blindness, nephropathy and neuropathy) and macrovascular (cardiovascular and stroke) degenerative complications because of uncontrolled level of glucose in blood. This also leads to the progression of oxidative stress and affecting metabolic, genetic and haemodynamic system by activation of polyol pathway, protein kinase C pathway, hexosamine pathway and increases advanced glycation end products (AGEs) formation. Diabetes mellitus and its associated complications are one of the major leading causes of mortality worldwide. Various natural products like alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, terpenoids and polyphenols are reported for their activity in management of diabetes and its associated diabetic complications. Tannins are systematically studied by many researchers in past few decades for their effect in diabetes and its complications."

30667562,"People of all backgrounds are susceptible to bone and cartilage damage, and these injuries can be debilitating. Current treatments for bone and cartilage injuries are less than optimal, and we are interested in developing new approaches to treat these diseases, specifically using human muscle-derived stem cells (hMDSCs). Our lab previously demonstrated that sex differences exist between male and female murine MDSCs; thus, this paper sought to investigate whether sex differences also exist in hMDSCs. In the present study, we characterized the chondrogenic and osteogenic sex differences of hMDSCs in vitro and in vivo. We performed in vitro osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation using hMDSC pellet cultures. As demonstrated by microCT, histology, and immunohistochemistry, male hMDSCs were more chondrogenic and osteogenic than their female counterparts in vitro. No differences were observed based on the sex of hMDSCs in osteogenic and chondrogenic gene expression and cell surface markers. For our in vivo study, we transduced hMDSCs with lenti-BMP2/GFP and transplanted these cells into critical-sized calvarial defects in mice. MicroCT results revealed that male hMDSCs regenerated more bone at 2 weeks and demonstrated higher bone density at 4 and 6 weeks than female hMDSCs. Histology demonstrated that both male and female hMDSCs regenerated functional bone. Clinical relevance: These studies reinforce that stem cells isolated from male and female patients differ in function, and we should disclose the sex of cells used in future studies. Considering sex differences of hMDSCs may help to improve cell-based therapies for autologous cell treatment of bone and cartilage damage. This article is protected by copyright.

30667081,"Mutant TP53 is a promising therapeutic target in cancers. Considering the current challenges facing the clinical treatment of cancer, as well as the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic targets in osteosarcomas, we aimed to evaluate the clinical significance of mutant TP53 in osteosarcoma patients and to explore the therapeutic effect of targeting mutant TP53 in osteosarcomas. We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between mutant TP53 and the overall survival of patients with osteosarcoma. A CRISPR-Cas9 system and a TP53 inhibitor, NSC59984, were also used to specifically knock-out and inhibit mutant TP53 in the human osteosarcoma cell lines, KHOS and KHOSR2. The meta-analysis demonstrated that mutations in the TP53 gene could be used to predict a poor 2-year survival in osteosarcoma patients. We also demonstrated that the expression of mutant TP53 in human osteosarcoma cell lines can be efficiently knocked-out using CRISPR-Cas9, and this decreased the proliferation, migration, and tumor formation activity of these osteosarcoma cells. Moreover, drug sensitivity to doxorubicin was increased in these TP53 knock-out osteosarcoma cells. NSC59984 also showed similar anti-tumor effects as CRISPR-Cas9 targeted TP53 in the osteosarcoma cells in vitro. We have also demonstrated that the knock-out or inhibition of mutant TP53 decreased the expression of the oncogene IGF-1R, anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 and Survivin in osteosarcoma cells. Collectively, these results suggest that mutant TP53 is a promising therapeutic target in osteosarcomas. Therefore, further studies exploring novel strategies to target mutant TP53 may help improve the treatment outcomes of osteosarcoma patients in the clinic. This article is protected by copyright.

30666821,"Bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2)-loaded collagen sponges remain the clinical standard for treatment of large bone defects when there is insufficient autograft, despite associated complications. Recent efforts to negate comorbidities have included biomaterials and gene therapy approaches to extend the duration of BMP-2 release and activity. In this study, we compared the collagen sponge clinical standard to chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan (CS-GAG) scaffolds as a delivery vehicle for recombinant human BMP-2 (rhBMP-2) and rhBMP-2 expression via human BMP-2 gene inserted into mesenchymal stem cells (BMP-2 MSC). We demonstrated extended release of rhBMP-2 from CS-GAG scaffolds compared to their collagen sponge counterparts, and further extended release from CS-GAG gels seeded with BMP-2 MSC. When used to treat a challenging critically sized femoral defect model in rats, both rhBMP-2 and BMP-2 MSC in CS-GAG induced comparable bone formation to the rhBMP-2 in collagen sponge, as measured by bone volume, strength, and stiffness. We conclude that CS-GAG scaffolds are a promising delivery vehicle for controlling the release of rhBMP-2 and to mediate the repair of critically sized segmental bone defects.

30666652,"Type 1 regulatory T (Tr1) cell is a special type of T regulatory cells with surface molecular markers such as lymphocyte-activation gene 3 and CD49b. A key property of Tr1 cells is the capability to produce high-level interleukin 10 (IL-10) upon activation, in a FOXP3-independent manner. The immunosuppressive function of IL-10 producing Tr1 cells has been extensively studied for many years. Autoimmune diseases (AIDs) are conditions in which the immune system breaks down and starts to attack the body. AIDs include inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis (MS), type 1 diabetes mellitus, Greaves' disease, and so forth. In recent years, more and more studies have documented that the number of Tr1 cells is decreased and the function is inhibited in a variety of AIDs, among which MS is the most widely studied. The protocol for engineering Tr1 cell therapy has been established and is gradually being used in clinical practice in recent years. Tr1 cell therapy has been proven to be safe and effective, but it is mainly involved in myeloid leukemia, graft versus host disease currently. Its therapeutic role in AIDs still needs to be further explored. In this study, we will summarize the research advances of Tr1 cells in AIDs, which will provide useful information for treating AIDs through Tr1 cell therapy in the future."
30666556,"Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a rare malignancy, associated with poor disease prognosis with a 5-year survival of only 20%. This has been attributed to late presentation of the disease, lack of early diagnostic markers and limited efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Elucidation of molecular events in GBC can contribute to better management of the disease by aiding in the identification of therapeutic targets. To identify aberrantly activated signaling events in GBC, tandem mass tag-based quantitative phosphoproteomic analysis of five GBC cell lines was carried out. Proline-rich Akt substrate 40 kDa (PRAS40) was one of the proteins found to be hyperphosphorylated in all the invasive GBC cell lines. Tissue microarray-based immunohistochemical labeling of phospho-PRAS40 (T246) revealed moderate to strong staining in 77% of the primary gallbladder adenocarcinoma cases. Regulation of PRAS40 activity by inhibiting its upstream kinase PIM1 resulted in a significant decrease in cell proliferation, colony forming and invasive ability of GBC cells. Our results support the role of PRAS40 phosphorylation in GBC cell survival and aggressiveness. This study also elucidates phospho-PRAS40 as a clinical marker in GBC and the role of PIM1 as a therapeutic target in GBC."

30666458,"Adenovirus 5 (Ad-5) infection is a common cause of acute respiratory infections and the main vector used in gene therapy. There are few studies on the relationship of Ad-5 to obesity. In the present study, we evaluated the chronic effects of Ad-5 infection on golden (Syrian) hamsters fed either a balanced diet (BD) or a high-fat diet (HFD). After a single inoculation with Ad-5 (1 × 10<sup>7</sup> pfu), the body weight of the animals was measured weekly. Medium-term (22 weeks) serum biochemical analyses and long-term (44 weeks) liver morphology, adiposity, and locomotive functionality (movement velocity) assessments were carried out. In the animals fed the BD, adenovirus infection produced hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. In the long term, it produced a 57% increase in epididymal pad fat and a 30% body weight gain compared with uninoculated animals. In addition, morphological changes related to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were observed. The animals fed the HFD had similar but more severe changes. In addition, the hamsters presented an obesity paradox: at the end of the study, the animals that had the most morphological and functional changes (significantly reduced movement velocity) had the lowest body weight. Despite the fact that an HFD appears to be a more harmful factor in the long term than adenovirus infection alone, infection could increase the severity of harmful effects in individuals with an HFD. Epidemiological studies are needed to evaluate the effect of adenovirus as a precursor of chronic liver and cardiovascular diseases, including the chronic effects of gene therapy."

However, the nature of Tfh cell subsets that are responsible for MBCs in CHC patients has not been evaluated. This study aimed to investigate Tfh and MBC immunity before and after direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy in patients with CHC. A total of 31 CHC patients and 15 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Individual patients were treated with sofosbuvir/ribavirin (SOF/RBV) or in combination with pegylated interferon alpha-2a (PEG-IFN-α-2a) for 12 weeks. Immunofluorescence revealed the frequency of ICOS<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> active Tfh cells in liver tissue of CHC patients was higher than that of healthy control. Tfh and B cell co-culture experiments showed that Tfh2 cells from CHC patients have potential ability to induce B cell differentiation and IgG production. Flow cytometry showed that the frequencies of CD21<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> activated MBCs, ICOS<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup> activated Tfh cells, Tfh1 (IFN-γ<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) cells, and Tfh2 (IL-4<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) cells, but not of Tfh17 (IL-17<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CXCR5<sup>+</sup>) cells, increased in CHC patients before and after DAA therapy. Collectively, ICOS<sup>+</sup> Tfh, Tfh1, Tfh2 cells, and MBCs participated in the antiviral treatment process of SOF/RBV with or without PEG-IFN-α-2a in CHC patients, and their activity was further enhanced during the treatment. KEY MESSAGES: This study aimed to investigate Tfh cells and MBC immunity in CHC patients. CD21<sup>-</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> activated MBCs increased in CHC patients before and after treatment. Tfh1 and Tfh2 cells increased in CHC patients before and after antiviral treatment. Intrahepatic activated Tfh cells increased in CHC patients before treatment. Tfh2 cells from CHC patients have a stronger ability to induce B cell differentiation."
30666309,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are currently the most popular vector platform technology for ocular gene therapy. While transduction efficiency and tropism of intravitreally administered AAV has been fairly well established in various retinal conditions, its transduction pattern in diabetic retinas has not previously been characterized. Here, we describe the transduction efficiencies of four different AAV serotypes, AAV2, 5, 8, and 9, in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse retinas after intravitreal injections, which differed according to the duration of diabetic induction. STZ was intraperitoneally injected into C57/B6 diabetic mice subjected to unilateral intravitreal injection of AAV2, AAV5, AAV8, and AAV9 packaged with EGFP. Significantly enhanced AAV2 and AAV9 transduction was observed in 2-month-old diabetic mouse retinas compared to the 2-week-old diabetic mouse retinas and nondiabetic, vector uninjected or injected retinas. Intravitreal injection of AAV5 or AAV8 serotype in 2-month- and 2-week-old diabetic mouse retinas did not show any significant vector transduction enhancement compared to the nondiabetic control retinas. The tropism of AAV2 and AAV9 in diabetic mouse retinas differed. AAV2 was transduced into various retinal cells, including Müller cells, microglia, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells, whereas AAV9 was effectively transduced only into RGC and horizontal cells. The expression levels of receptors and co-receptors for AAV2 and AAV9 were significantly increased in 2-month-old diabetic mouse retinas. The results of our study demonstrated that AAV2 and AAV9 may be the vector of choice in treating diabetic retinopathy (DR) with gene therapy, and DR-related retinal changes may improve AAV vector transduction efficiency."
30666308,"Here we evaluated the utility of MRI to monitor intrathecal infusions in nonhuman primates. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) spiked with gadoteridol, a gadolinium-based MRI contrast agent, enabled real-time visualization of infusions delivered either via cerebromedullary cistern, lumbar, cerebromedullary and lumbar, or intracerebroventricular infusion. The kinetics of vector clearance from the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were analyzed. Our results highlight the value of MRI in optimizing the delivery of infusate into CSF. In particular, MRI revealed differential patterns of infusate distribution depending on the route of delivery. Gadoteridol coverage analysis showed that cerebellomedullary cistern delivery was a reliable and effective route of injection, achieving broad infusate distribution in the brain and spinal cord, and was even greater when combined with lumbar injection. In contrast, intracerebroventricular injection resulted in strong cortical coverage but little spinal distribution. Lumbar injection alone led to the distribution of MRI contrast agent mainly in the spinal cord with little cortical coverage, but this delivery route was unreliable. Similarly, vector clearance analysis showed differences between different routes of delivery. Overall, our data support the value of monitoring CSF injections to dissect different patterns of gadoteridol distribution based on the route of intrathecal administration."
30666297,"BCL2-family proteins have a central role in the mitochondrial apoptosis machinery and their expression is known to be deregulated in many cancer types. Effort in the development of small molecules that selectively target anti-apoptotic members of this family i.e., Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Mcl-1 recently opened novel therapeutic opportunities. Among these apoptosis-inducing agents, BH3-mimetics (i.e., venetoclax) led to promising preclinical and clinical activity in B cell malignancies. However, several mechanisms of intrinsic or acquired resistance have been described <i>ex vivo</i> therefore predictive markers of response as well as mechanism-based combinations have to be designed. In the present study, we analyzed the expression of the BCL2-family genes across 10 mature B cell malignancies through computational normalization of 21 publicly available Affimetrix datasets gathering 1,219 patient samples. To better understand the deregulation of anti- and pro-apoptotic members of the BCL2-family in hematological disorders, we first compared gene expression profiles of malignant B cells to their relative normal control (naïve B cell to plasma cells, <i>n</i> = 37). We further assessed BCL2-family expression according to tissue localization i.e., peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph node, molecular subgroups or disease status i.e., indolent to aggressive. Across all cancer types, we showed that anti-apoptotic genes are upregulated while pro-apoptotic genes are downregulated when compared to normal counterpart cells. Of interest, our analysis highlighted that, independently of the nature of malignant B cells, the pro-apoptotic BH3-only <i>BCL2L11</i> and <i>PMAIP1</i> are deeply repressed in tumor niches, suggesting a central role of the microenvironment in their regulation. In addition, we showed selective modulations across molecular subgroups and showed that the BCL2-family expression profile was related to tumor aggressiveness. Finally, by integrating recent data on venetoclax-monotherapy clinical activity with the expression of BCL2-family members involved in the venetoclax response, we determined that the ratio <i>(BCL2</i>+<i>BCL2L11</i>+<i>BAX)/BCL2L1</i> was the strongest predictor of venetoclax response for mature B cell malignancies <i>in vivo</i>."
30666257,"Niemann-Pick type C1 (NPC1) disease is caused by a deleterious mutation in the <i>Npc1</i> gene, causing lysosomal accumulation of unesterified cholesterol and sphingolipids. Consequently, NPC1 disease patients suffer from severe neurovisceral symptoms which, in the absence of effective treatments, result in premature death. NPC1 disease patients display increased plasma levels of cholesterol oxidation products such as those enriched in oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), a pro-inflammatory mediator. While it has been shown that inflammation precedes and exacerbates symptom severity in NPC1 disease, it is unclear whether oxLDL contributes to NPC1 disease progression. In this study, we investigated the effects of increasing anti-oxLDL IgM autoantibodies on systemic and neurological symptoms in an NPC1 disease mouse model. For this purpose, <i>Npc1</i><sup>

                        <i>nih</i>
                    </sup> mice injected with heat-inactivated pneumococci displayed an improved hepatic phenotype, including liver lipid accumulation and inflammation. In addition, regression of motor skills was delayed in immunized <i>Npc1</i><sup>
                        <i>nih</i>
                    </sup> . In line with these results, brain analyses showed an improved cerebellar phenotype and neuroinflammation in comparison with control-treated subjects. This study highlights the potential of the pneumococcal immunization as a novel therapeutical approach in NPC1 disease. Future research should investigate whether implementation of this therapy can improve life span and quality of life of NPC1 disease patients."

30666134,"Ubiquitin-like with plant homeodomain and really interesting new gene finger domains 1 (UHRF1) functions as an epigenetic regulator recruiting PCNA, DNMT1, histone deacetylase 1, G9a, SuV39H, herpes virus-associated ubiquitin-specific protease, and Tat-interactive protein by multiple corresponding domains of DNA and H3 to maintain DNA methylation and histone modifications. Overexpression of UHRF1 has been found as a potential biomarker in various cancers resulting in either DNA hypermethylation or global DNA hypo-methylation, which participates in the occurrence, progression, and invasion of cancer. The role of UHRF1 in the reciprocal interaction between DNA methylation and histone modifications, the dynamic structural transformation of UHRF1 protein within epigenetic code replication machinery in epigenetic regulations, as well as modifications during cell cycle and chemotherapy targeting UHRF1 are evaluated in this study."

30665931,"A middle-aged woman presented with a history of symptoms of depression with psychotic features severely affecting her physical health. Neuroimaging of her brain suggested pathological changes out of keeping with her age, leading to further investigations including genetic testing for cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis was also considered as a differential diagnosis as an initial serum test for anti-NMDAR autoantibodies was positive. Her symptoms resolved following treatment with electroconvulsive therapy. Despite her initial neuroimaging, her genetic test for CADASIL was negative and her subsequent test for anti-NMDAR autoantibodies was negative, suggesting that the initial test may have been a false positive."
30665891,"Bardet-Beidl Syndrome (BBS) manifests from genetic mutations encoding for one or more BBS proteins. BBS4 loss impacts olfactory ciliation and odor detection yet the cellular mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we report that <i>Bbs4</i><sup>

Within the OSN dendritic knob, the basal bodies are dynamic with incorporation of ectopically expressed centrin-2 and γ-tubulin occurring after nascent ciliogenesis. Importantly, BBS4 loss results in the reduction of basal body numbers separate from cilia loss. Adenoviral expression of BBS4 restored OSN cilia lengths and was sufficient to re-establish odor detection but failed to rescue ciliary and basal body numbers. Our results yield a model for the plurality of BBS4 functions in OSNs that includes intraciliary and periciliary roles that can explain the loss of cilia and penetrance of ciliopathy phenotypes in olfactory neurons."
30665853,"Adoptive T-cell transfer of therapeutic TCR holds great promise to specifically kill cancer cells, but relies on modifying the patient's own T cells ex vivo before injection. The manufacturing of T cells in a tailor-made setting is a long and expensive process which could be resolved by the use of universal cells. Currently, only the Natural Killer (NK) cell line NK-92 is FDA approved for universal use. In order to expand their recognition ability, they were equipped with Chimeric Antigen Receptors (CARs). However, unlike CARs, T-cell receptors (TCRs) can recognize all cellular proteins, which expand NK-92 recognition to the whole proteome."
30665552,"Hypoparathyroidism, a disorder characterized by hypocalcemia ensuing from inadequate parathyroid hormone secretion, is a rather rare disorder caused by multiple etiologies. When not caused by inadvertent damage or removal of the parathyroids during neck surgery, it is usually genetically determined. Epidemiological figures of this disease are still scarce and mainly limited to countries where non-anonymous databases are available and to surgical case series. Both the surgical and non-surgical forms pose diagnostic challenges. For surgical hypoparathyroidism, transient forms have to be ruled out even in the long term, in order to avoid unnecessary chronic replacement therapy with calcium and calcitriol. Regarding non-surgical hypoparathyroidism, once referred to as idiopathic, a systematic clinically and genetically-driven approach to define the precise diagnosis have to be pursued. In the case of syndromic hypoparathyroidism, patients have to be screened for associated abnormalities. Autoimmune, non-genetic hypoparathyroidism is still a diagnosis of exclusion, since no specific autoantibodies are specific for this condition."
30665488,"Dear Editor, Immune-checkpoint blockade is a type of passive immunotherapy aimed at enhancing preexisting anti-tumor responses of the organism, blocking self-tolerance molecular interactions between T-lymphocytes and neoplastic cells (1,2). Despite a significant increase in progression-free survival, a large proportion of patients affected by metastatic melanoma do not show durable responses even after appropriate diagnostic categorization and shared therapeutic choices (3-9). Therefore, predictive biomarkers of clinical response are urgently needed, and predictive immunohistochemistry (IHC) meets these requirements. Strong evidence suggests that DNA mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency is a frequent condition in malignant melanoma, as well as in other tumors (10). As is known, DNA MMR is a safeguard system for the detection and repair of DNA errors, which can randomly occur in the phase of DNA replication inside the cell. In humans, seven DNA MMR proteins (Mlh1, Mlh3, Msh2, Msh3, Msh6, Pms1, and Pms2) work in a coordinated and sequential manner to repair DNA mismatches. When this system is defective, the cell accumulates a series of replication errors in terms of new microsatellites; therefore, a condition of genetic hypermutability and microsatellite instability (MSI) takes place inside the cell itself (11). For this reason, my working group has started to search for MMR protein deficiency in melanoma biopsies from patients of both sexes and of all ages with metastatic spread, correlating the data with the response to pembrolizumab, the well-known anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1) human monoclonal immunoglobulin G4, capable of blocking the interaction between PD1, the surface receptor of activated T-lymphocytes, and its ligand, the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), favoring melanoma cell attack by T-lymphocytes (1) rather than its depression (12). PD-L1 is highly expressed in about half of all melanomas and thus the role of PD1 in melanoma immune evasion is now well established (13). Surprisingly, the best therapeutic results to pembrolizumab, in terms of progression-free survival and overall survival, occur precisely in those patients, approximately 7% in my database, affected by deficient MMR (dMMR) melanomas. In particular, the most important benefits to pembrolizumab-based treatment have occurred in a female patient, who developed a subungual melanoma in the second finger of the left hand at the age of 41 years, together with lymph node metastases to ipsilateral axilla at the onset. The patient was promptly submitted to amputation of the first phalanx and emptying of the axillary cable. The primary tumor was a vertical growth phase melanoma with a Breslow's depth of 1.4 mm; three mitotic figures for 1 mm2 were ascertained. There was no evidence of ulceration, regression, microsatellitosis, or lymphocytic infiltration; moreover, the surgical margins tested free of disease. Further molecular analyses did not show rearrangements in B-RAF and C-KIT genes. After four years, metastases appeared in the brain and ileum; however, at present the patient is still alive and in complete pembrolizumab response with progression-free survival and overall survival of 956 days and 2546 days, respectively. The tumor was afterwards identified as a dMMR melanoma for an exclusive loss of Msh6 expression on IHC (Figure 1). This finding is in line with the fact that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the use of pembrolizumab in 2017 for unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with MMR deficiency (14). In conclusion, dMMR melanoma seems to be a particular subset of disease that can be identified with high sensibility and specificity by predictive IHC as a complete loss of one or more DNA MMR proteins and that deserves targeted therapy."

30665327,"Hypoxia occurs frequently in human cancers and promotes stabilization and activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). HIF-1α is specific for the hypoxia response, and its degradation mediated by three enzymes EGLN1, EGLN2 and EGLN3. Although EGLNs expression has been found to be related to prognosis of many cancers, few studies examined DNA methylation in EGLNs and its relationship to prognosis of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed EGLNs DNA methylation data from tumor tissue samples of 1,230 early-stage NSCLC patients, as well as gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The sliding windows sequential forward feature selection method and weighted random forest were used to screen out the candidate CpG probes in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinomas patients, respectively, in both discovery and validation phases. Then Cox regression was performed to evaluate the association between DNA methylation and overall survival. Among the 34 CpG probes in EGLNs, DNA methylation at cg25923056<sub>EGLN2</sub> was identified to be significantly associated with LUAD survival (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, P = 9.90 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), and correlated with EGLN2 expression (r = - 0.36, P = 1.52 × 10<sup>-11</sup>). Meanwhile, EGLN2 expression was negatively correlated with HIF1A expression in tumor tissues (r = - 0.30, P = 4.78 × 10<sup>-8</sup>) and significantly (P = 0.037) interacted with HIF1A expression on overall survival. Therefore, DNA methylation of EGLN2- HIF1A is a potential marker for LUAD prognosis and these genes are potential treatment targets for further development of HIF-1α inhibitors in lung cancer therapy."
30665247,"Next-generation sequencing is a powerful diagnostic tool, yet it has proven inadequate to establish a diagnosis in all cases of congenital hypotonia or childhood onset weakness. We sought to describe the impact of whole exome sequencing (WES), which has only recently become widely available clinically, on molecular diagnosis in the Nationwide Children's Hospital Neuromuscular clinics. We reviewed records of all patients in our clinic with pediatric onset of symptoms who had WES done since 2013. Patients were included if clinical suspicion was high for a neuromuscular disease. Clinical WES was performed in 30 families, representing 31 patients, all of whom were seen for hypotonia, weakness, or gait disturbance. Probands had between 2 and 12 genetic diagnostic tests prior to obtaining WES. A genetic diagnosis was established in 11 families (37%), and in 12 patients (39%), with mutations in 10 different genes. Five of these genes have only been associated with disease since 2013, and were not previously represented on clinically available disease gene panels. Our results confirm the utility of WES in the clinical setting, particularly for genetically heterogeneous syndromes. The availability of WES can provide an end to the diagnostic odyssey for parents and allow for expansion of phenotypes."
30665184,"Synthetic microRNA (miRNA) minigenes (SMIGs) have a major potential for molecular therapy; however, their optimal architecture still needs to be determined. We have previously optimized the stem structure of miRNA hairpins for efficient gene knockdown. Here, we investigate the overall architecture of SMIGs driven by polymerase II-dependent promoters. When miRNA hairpins were placed directly behind the promoter, gene knockdown was inefficient as compared with constructs containing an intercalated sequence (""spacer""). Spacer sequence was relevant for knockdown efficiency and concatenation potential: GFP-based sequences (even when truncated or including stop codons) were particularly efficient. In contrast, a spacer of similar length based on a CD4 intronic sequence was entirely inefficient. Spacer sequences influenced miRNA steady-state levels without affecting transcript stability. We demonstrate that with an optimized spacer, up to five concatenated hairpins targeting two different genes are efficiently expressed and able to knock down their respective targets. Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells containing a CCR5 knockdown SMIG demonstrated a sustained in vivo efficacy of our approach. In summary, we have defined features that optimize SMIG efficiency. Based on these results, optimized knockdown of genes of interest, such as the HIV co-receptor CCR5 and the NADPH oxidase subunit p22<sup>phox</sup>, was achieved."
30665183,"mRNA therapeutics hold great promise for the treatment of human diseases. While incorporating naturally occurring modified nucleotides during synthesis has greatly increased their potency and safety, challenges in selective expression have hindered clinical applications. MicroRNA (miRNA)-regulated in vitro-transcribed mRNAs, called miRNA switches, have been used to control the expression of exogenous mRNA in a cell-selective manner. However, the effect of nucleotide modifications on miRNA-dependent silencing has not been examined. Here we show that the incorporation of pseudouridine, N1-methylpseudourdine, or pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine, which increases translation, tends to decrease the regulation of miRNA switches. Moreover, pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine modification enables one miRNA target site at the 3' UTR to be as effective as four target sites. We also demonstrate that the effects of pseudouridine, pseudouridine and 5-methylcytidine, and N1-methylpseudourdine modification are miRNA switch specific and do not correlate with the proportion of modified nucleotides in the miRNA target site. Furthermore, modified miRNA switches containing seed-complementary target sites are poorly regulated by miRNA. We also show that placing the miRNA target site in the 5' UTR of the miRNA switch abolishes the effect of nucleotide modification on miRNA-dependent silencing. This work provides insights into the influence of nucleotide modifications on miRNA-dependent silencing and informs the design of optimal miRNA switches."
30665019,"Despite great advances in skin wound care utilizing grafting techniques, the resulting severe scarring, deformity and ineffective vascularization remains a challenge. Alternatively, tissue engineering of new skin using patient-derived stem cells and scaffolding materials promises to greatly increase the functional and aesthetic outcome of skin wound healing. This work focused on the optimization of a polyethylene glycol modified (PEGylated) platelet-rich plasma (PRP) hydrogel for the protracted release of cytokines, growth factors, and signaling molecules and also the delivery of a provisional physical framework for stem cell angiogenesis. Freshly collected whole blood was utilized to synthesize PEGylated PRP hydrogels containing platelet concentrations ranging from 0 to 200,000 platelets/µl. Hydrogels were characterized using thromboelastography and impedance aggregometry for platelet function and were visualized using scanning electron microscopy. To assess the effects of PEGylated PRP hydrogels on cells, PRP solutions were seeded with human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) prior to gelation. Following 14 days of incubation in vitro, increased platelet concentrations resulted in higher ASC proliferation and vascular gene and protein expression (assessed via RT-PCR, ELISA, and immunochemistry). Using a rat skin excision model, wounds treated with PRP + ASC hydrogels increased the number of vessels in the wound by day 8 (80.2 vs. 62.6 vessels/mm<sup>2</sup>) compared to controls. In conclusion, the proposed PEGylated PRP hydrogel promoted both in vitro and transient in vivo angiogenesis of ASCs for improved wound healing. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings support an innovative means of cellular therapy intervention to improve surgical wound healing in a normal wound model. ASCs seeded within PEGylated PRP could be an efficacious and completely autologous therapy for treating patients who have poorly healing wounds caused by vascular insufficiency, previous irradiation, or full-thickness burns. Because wound healing is a dynamic and complex process, the application of more than one growth factor with ASCs demonstrates an advantageous way of improving healing."

30664951,"Mutations in LZTR1, already known to be causal in familial schwannomatosis type 2, have been recently involved in a small proportion of patients with autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive Noonan syndrome. LZTR1 is also a driver gene in non syndromal glioblastoma. We report a 26-year-old patient with typical Noonan syndrome, and the dominantly transmitted c.850C > T (p.(Arg284Cys)) variant in LZTR1. An oligoastrocytoma was diagnosed in the patient at the age of 22 years; recurrence of the tumor occurred at age 26, as a ganglioblastoma. The patient had been transiently treated with growth hormone between ages 15 and 17. Considering the implication of LZTR1 in sporadic tumors of the nervous system, we hypothesize that gliomas are a possible complication of LZTR1-related Noonan syndrome. This report also supports a possible link between occurrence of a cerebral tumor in Noonan syndrome and a previous treatment with growth hormone."
30664919,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons from substantia nigra pars compacta of basal ganglia caused due to gene mutation, misfolded protein aggregation, reactive oxygen species generation and inflammatory stress. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons results in muscle stiffness, uncoordinated body movements, sleep disturbance, fatigue, amnesia and impaired voice. Currently, levodopa (L-DOPA) administration is the most widely used therapy for PD. But prolonged administration of L-DOPA is associated with the symptoms of dyskinesia. However, emerging evidences suggest the role of cannabinoid receptors (CBRs) in curtailing the progression of PD by activating neuroprotective pathways. Hence, cannabinoid therapy could be a promising alternative to combat PD in future. In the present review we have discussed the potential role of CBRs in attenuating the key mechanisms of PD and how the existing research gaps needs to be bridged in order to understand the molecular mechanism of CBRs in detail."
30664903,"Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PIDs) are a heterogeneous group of rare immune disorders with genetic causes. Effective treatments using hematopoietic stem cells or pharmaceutical agents have been around for decades. However, for many patients, these treatment options are ineffective, partly because the rarity of these PIDs complicates the diagnosis and therapy. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer a potential solution to these problems. The proliferative capacity of iPSCs allows for the preparation of a large, stable supply of hematopoietic cells with the same genome as the patient, allowing for new human cell models that can trace cellular abnormalities during the pathogenesis and lead to new drug discovery. PID models using patient iPSCs have been instrumental in identifying deviations in the development or function of several types of immune cells, revealing new molecular targets for experimental therapies. These models are only in their early stages and for the most part have recapitulated results from existing models using animals or primary cells. However, iPSC-based models are being used to study complex diseases of other organs, including those with multigenic causes, suggesting that advances in differentiation processes will expand iPSC-based models to complex PIDs as well."
30664902,"Transplantation of dopaminergic precursors (DPs) is a promising therapeutic strategy of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, limited cell source for dopaminergic precursors has become a major obstacle for transplantation therapy. Our group demonstrated previously that mouse fibroblasts can be reprogrammed into induced dopaminergic precursors (iDPs) with high differentiation efficiency. In the current study, we hypothesized that a similar strategy can be applied to generate human iDPs for future cell therapy of PD. We overexpressed transcription factors Brn2, Sox2, and Foxa2 in human fibroblasts and observed formation of neurospheres. Subsequent characterization of the precursor colonies confirmed the generation of human induced dopaminergic precursors (hiDPs). These hiDPs were capable of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation. The hiDPs demonstrated high immunoreactivity for neural progenitor markers and high levels of gene expression for ventral mesencephalon-related neural progenitor markers such as Lmx1a, NIKX6.1, Corin, Otx2 and Mash1. Furthermore, the hiDPs could be differentiated into dopaminergic neurons with ˜80% efficiency, which significantly increased major functionally relevant proteins such as TH, DAT, AADC, Lmx1B, and VMAT2 compared to hiDPs. Additionally, hiDPs are more dopaminergic progenitor-restricted compare to those hiDP-like cells reprogrammed only by Brn2 and Sox2. Together, these results suggest that hiDPs with high differentiation efficiency can be generated by direct lineage reprogramming of fibroblasts with transcription factors Brn2, Sox2, and Foxa2. These hiDPs may serve as a safe and effective cell source for transplantation treatment of PD."
30664812,"Novel immune checkpoint blockades, including those targeting CD73 and A2aR, are being evaluated in malignancies in clinical trials. Here, we investigated the expression of CD73 and A2aR as well as tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), and analyzed their correlations with clinicopathological characteristics and survival in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). We found that CD73 expression on tumor cells, rather than the total protein and gene levels of CD73, was associated with survival. Patients with CD73<sup>+</sup> /Pax-5<sup>+</sup> (median survival, 57.8 months; 95% CI, 46.4-69.3) experienced significantly poorer outcomes than those with CD73<sup>-</sup> /Pax-5<sup>+</sup> (median survival, 73.5 months; 95% CI, 65.9-81.2). Additionally, A2aR expression on both total TILs and CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs was correlated with survival. Patients with A2aR<sup>+</sup> TILs (median survival, 53.3 months; 95% CI, 40.6-66.0) had a significantly shorter survival time than patients with A2aR<sup>-</sup> TILs (median survival, 74.5 months; 95% CI, 67.5-81.5). Spearman's rank test showed that CD73 expression on tumor cells was positively correlated with A2aR expression on TILs (R=0.395, p = 0.001). We further found that patients could be more precisely stratified through the combination of CD73 tumor cell expression and A2aR TILs expression, and patients with CD73<sup>+</sup> /Pax-5<sup>+</sup> and A2aR<sup>+</sup> TILs experienced the worst outcome. We also revealed that patients with CD73<sup>+</sup> /Pax-5<sup>+</sup> and low CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs or low absolute lymphocyte counts had unfavorable outcomes. Overall, our findings uncovered that patients with CD73<sup>+</sup> on tumor cells as well as A2aR<sup>+</sup> on TILs or low CD8<sup>+</sup> TILs exhibited inferior survival, supporting potential combination strategies using CD73/A2aR immunosuppressive blockades as treatment options for DLBCL patients.

30664805,"Interleukin-35 (IL-35) is a cytokine recently discovered to play a potent immunosuppressive role by intensifying the functions of regulatory T cells and inhibiting the proliferation and functions of T helper 1 and T helper 17 cells. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for cell-based immune therapy, and our previous study showed that IL-35 gene modification can effectively enhance the therapeutic effect of MSCs in vitro. In this study, we isolated adipose tissue-derived MSCs in vitro and infected them with lentiviral vectors overexpressing the IL-35 gene, thereby creating IL-35-MSCs. Subsequently, IL-35-MSCs were then injected into mice of the allogeneic heterotopic abdominal heart transplant model to determine their effect on allograft rejection. The results showed that IL-35-MSCs could continuously secrete IL-35 in vivo and in vitro, successfully alleviate allograft rejection and prolong graft survival. In addition, compared to MSCs, IL-35-MSCs showed a stronger immunosuppressive ability and further reduced the percentage of Th17 cells, increased the proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells, and regulated Th1/Th2 balance in heart transplant mice. These findings suggest that IL-35-MSCs have more advantages than MSCs in inhibiting graft rejection and may thus provide a new approach for inducing immune tolerance during transplantation.

30664781,"ß-thalassemia is caused by ß-globin gene mutations resulting in reduced (β<sup>+</sup>) or absent (β<sup>0</sup>) hemoglobin production. Patient life expectancy has recently increased, but the need for chronic transfusions in transfusion-dependent thalassemia (TDT) and iron chelation impairs quality of life<sup>1</sup>. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation represents the curative treatment, with thalassemia-free survival exceeding 80%. However, it is available to a minority of patients and is associated with morbidity, rejection and graft-versus-host disease<sup>2</sup>. Gene therapy with autologous HSCs modified to express ß-globin represents a potential therapeutic option. We treated three adults and six children with ß<sup>0</sup> or severe ß<sup>+</sup> mutations in a phase 1/2 trial ( NCT02453477 ) with an intrabone administration of HSCs transduced with the lentiviral vector GLOBE. Rapid hematopoietic recovery with polyclonal multilineage engraftment of vector-marked cells was achieved, with a median of 37.5% (range 12.6-76.4%) in hematopoietic progenitors and a vector copy number per cell (VCN) of 0.58 (range 0.10-1.97) in erythroid precursors at 1 year, in absence of clonal dominance. Transfusion requirement was reduced in the adults. Three out of four evaluable pediatric participants discontinued transfusions after gene therapy and were transfusion independent at the last follow-up. Younger age and persistence of higher VCN in the repopulating hematopoietic cells are associated with better outcome."
30664779,"Chordoma is a primary bone cancer with no approved therapy<sup>1</sup>. The identification of therapeutic targets in this disease has been challenging due to the infrequent occurrence of clinically actionable somatic mutations in chordoma tumors<sup>2,3</sup>. Here we describe the discovery of therapeutically targetable chordoma dependencies via genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 screening and focused small-molecule sensitivity profiling. These systematic approaches reveal that the developmental transcription factor T (brachyury; TBXT) is the top selectively essential gene in chordoma, and that transcriptional cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors targeting CDK7/12/13 and CDK9 potently suppress chordoma cell proliferation. In other cancer types, transcriptional CDK inhibitors have been observed to downregulate highly expressed, enhancer-associated oncogenic transcription factors<sup>4,5</sup>. In chordoma, we find that T is associated with a 1.5-Mb region containing 'super-enhancers' and is the most highly expressed super-enhancer-associated transcription factor. Notably, transcriptional CDK inhibition leads to preferential and concentration-dependent downregulation of cellular brachyury protein levels in all models tested. In vivo, CDK7/12/13-inhibitor treatment substantially reduces tumor growth. Together, these data demonstrate small-molecule targeting of brachyury transcription factor addiction in chordoma, identify a mechanism of T gene regulation that underlies this therapeutic strategy, and provide a blueprint for applying systematic genetic and chemical screening approaches to discover vulnerabilities in genomically quiet cancers."
30664764,"Immune checkpoint blockade therapy has shifted the paradigm for cancer treatment. However, the majority of patients lack effective responses due to insufficient T cell infiltration in tumors. Here we show that expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in tumor cells determines the immunostimulatory feature of the tumor microenvironment (TME) and is positively associated with prolonged survival. UCP2 reprograms the immune state of the TME by altering its cytokine milieu in an interferon regulatory factor 5-dependent manner. Consequently, UCP2 boosts the conventional type 1 dendritic cell- and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dependent anti-tumor immune cycle and normalizes the tumor vasculature. Finally we show, using either a genetic or pharmacological approach, that induction of UCP2 sensitizes melanomas to programmed cell death protein-1 blockade treatment and elicits effective anti-tumor responses. Together, this study demonstrates that targeting the UCP2 pathway is a potent strategy for alleviating the immunosuppressive TME and overcoming the primary resistance of programmed cell death protein-1 blockade."
30664691,"One of the mechanisms by which advanced prostate cancer develops resistance to androgen deprivation therapy is the elevated expression of C-terminally truncated androgen receptor (AR) variants. These variants, such as AR-V7, originate from aberrant splicing of the AR pre-mRNA and the inclusion of a cryptic exon containing a premature stop codon in the mRNA. The resulting loss of the ligand-binding domain allows AR-V7 to act as a constitutively active transcription factor. Here, we designed two antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) directed against cryptic splicing signals within the AR pre-mRNA. These two AONs, AON-ISE and AON-ESE, demonstrated high efficiency in silencing AR-V7 splicing without affecting full-length AR expression. The subsequent downregulation of AR-V7-target gene UBE2C was accompanied by inhibition of androgen-independent cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC)-derived cell line models 22Rv1, DuCaP, and VCaP. Our results show that splicing-directed AONs can efficiently prevent expression of AR-V7, providing an attractive new therapeutic option for the treatment of CRPC."
30664630,"The molecular pathogenesis of salivary gland acinic cell carcinoma (AciCC) is poorly understood. The secretory Ca-binding phosphoprotein (SCPP) gene cluster at 4q13 encodes structurally related phosphoproteins of which some are specifically expressed at high levels in the salivary glands and constitute major components of saliva. Here we report on recurrent rearrangements [t(4;9)(q13;q31)] in AciCC that translocate active enhancer regions from the SCPP gene cluster to the region upstream of Nuclear Receptor Subfamily 4 Group A Member 3 (NR4A3) at 9q31. We show that NR4A3 is specifically upregulated in AciCCs, and that active chromatin regions and gene expression signatures in AciCCs are highly correlated with the NR4A3 transcription factor binding motif. Overexpression of NR4A3 in mouse salivary gland cells increases expression of known NR4A3 target genes and has a stimulatory functional effect on cell proliferation. We conclude that NR4A3 is upregulated through enhancer hijacking and has important oncogenic functions in AciCC."
30664620,"Alterations of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor and BDNF have consistently been associated with affective disorders. Two functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs6295 of the serotonin 1A receptor gene (HTR1A) and rs6265 of brain-derived neurotrophic factor gene (BDNF), may impact transcriptional regulation and expression of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor. Here we investigated interaction effects of rs6295 and rs6265 on 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor binding. Forty-six healthy subjects were scanned with PET using the radioligand [carbonyl-<sup>11</sup>C]WAY-100635. Genotyping was performed for rs6265 and rs6295. Subjects showing a genotype with at least three risk alleles (G of rs6295 or A of rs6265) were compared to control genotypes. Cortical surface binding potential (BP<sub>ND</sub>) was computed for 32 cortical regions of interest (ROI). Mixed model was applied to study main and interaction effects of ROI and genotype. ANOVA was used for post hoc analyses. Individuals with the risk genotypes exhibited an increase in 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor binding by an average of 17% (mean BP<sub>ND</sub> 3.56 ± 0.74 vs. 2.96 ± 0.88). Mixed model produced an interaction effect of ROI and genotype on BP<sub>ND</sub> and differences could be demonstrated in 10 ROI post hoc. The combination of disadvantageous allelic expression of rs6295 and rs6265 may result in a 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor profile comparable to affective disorders as increased 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> receptor binding is a well published phenotype of depression. Thus, epistasis between BDNF and HTR1A may contribute to the multifactorial risk for affective disorders and our results strongly advocate further research on this genetic signature in affective disorders."
30664619,"Deletions in the 15q11.2 region of the human genome are associated with neurobehavioral deficits, and motor development delay, as well as in some cases, symptoms of autism or schizophrenia. The cytoplasmic FMRP-interacting protein 1 (CYFIP1) is one of the four genes contained within this locus and has been associated with other genetic forms of autism spectrum disorders (ASD). In mice, Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency leads to alteration of dendritic spine morphology and defects in synaptic plasticity, two pathophysiological hallmarks of mouse models of ASD. At the behavioral level, however, Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency leads to minor phenotypes, not directly relevant for 15q11.2 deletion syndrome or ASD. A fundamental question is whether neuronal phenotypes caused by the mutation of Cyfip1 are relevant for the human condition. Here, we describe a synaptic cluster of ASD-associated proteins centered on CYFIP1 and the adhesion protein Neuroligin-3. Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency in mice led to decreased dendritic spine density and stability associated with social behavior and motor learning phenotypes. Behavioral training early in development resulted in alleviating the motor learning deficits caused by Cyfip1 haploinsufficiency. Altogether, these data provide new insight into the neuronal and behavioral phenotypes caused by Cyfip1 mutation and proof-of-concept for the development of a behavioral therapy to treat phenotypes associated with 15q11.2 syndromes and ASD."
30664289,"When considering the clinical applications of autologous cell replacement therapy of human iPSC-derived cells there is a clear need to better understand what the immune response will be before we embark on extensive clinical trials to treat or model human disease. We performed a detailed assessment comparing human fibroblast cell lines (termed F1) reprogrammed into human iPSC and subsequently differentiated back to fibroblast cells (termed F2) or other human iPSC-derived cells including neural stem cells made from either retroviral, episomal or synthetic mRNA cell reprogramming methods. Global proteomic analysis reveals the main differences in signal transduction and immune cell protein expression between F1 and F2 cells, implicating wild type toll like receptor protein 3 (TLR3). Furthermore, global methylome analysis identified an isoform of the human TLR3 gene that is not epigenetically reset correctly upon differentiation to F2 cells resulting in a hypomethylated transcription start site in the TLR3 isoform promoter and overexpression in most human iPSC-derived cells not seen in normal human tissue. The human TLR3 isoform in human iPSC-NSC functions to suppress NF-KB p65 signaling pathway in response to virus (Poly IC), suggesting suppressed immunity of iPSC-derived cells to viral infection. The sustained wild type TLR3 and TLR3 isoform over expression is central to understanding the altered immunogenicity of human iPSC-derived cells calling for screening of human iPSC-derived cells for TLR3 expression levels before applications. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: The cell reprogramming process alters the immune response of most iPSC-derived cells highlighting human TLR3 isoform over expression that functions to suppress innate immune signal transduction and provides an insight for future clinical applications of autologous human iPSC-derived cell transplantation. We propose that screening human iPSC clones and their derived cells for alterations in the genome of patient cells that include expression levels of human TLR3 and its shorter TLR3 isoform identified in this work is essential before embarking on ""first in man"" clinical trials or human disease modeling using human iPSC. © AlphaMed Press 2019."
30664199,"Sodium houttuyfonate (SH) has been indicated to play an important anti‑inflammatory role. Previous studies have confirmed that SH can inhibit the NF‑κB pathway in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)‑induced mastitis in bovine mammary epithelial cells. However, the effects of SH on LPS‑induced mastitis in animals should be verified to further evaluate its actual value. In the present study, the anti‑inflammatory effects of SH were investigated in mouse models and a mouse mammary epithelial cell line. Hematoxylin and eosin staining (H&E) showed that SH therapy significantly alleviated the pathological changes in mammary glands. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity analysis demonstrated that SH substantially decreased MPO activity in vivo. RT‑qPCR results showed that SH reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)‑1, IL‑6 and tumor necrosis factor α both in vivo and in vitro. In addition, western blot results indicated that SH suppressed the phosphorylation of nuclear factor kappa‑light‑chain‑enhancer of activated B‑cells (NF‑κB) p65 protein and reduced the degradation of inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B‑cells alpha protein in vivo and in vitro. These results demonstrated that SH ameliorates LPS‑induced mastitis by inhibiting the NF‑κB pathway."
30664189,"A significant percentage (~30%) of estrogen receptor‑α (ERα)‑positive tumors become refractory to endocrine therapies; however, the mechanisms responsible for this resistance remain largely unknown. Chronic exposure to arsenic through foods and contaminated water has been linked to an increased incidence of several tumors and long‑term health complications. Preclinical and population studies have indicated that arsenic exposure may interfere with endocrine regulation and increase the risk of breast tumorigenesis. In this study, we examined the effects of sodium arsenite (NaAsIII) exposure in ERα‑positive breast cancer cells in vitro and in mammary tumor xenografts. The results revealed that acute (within 4 days) and long‑term (10 days to 7 weeks) in vitro exposure to environmentally relevant doses reduced breast cancer 1 (BRCA1) and ERα expression associated with the gain of cyclin D1 (CCND1) and folate receptor 1 (FOLR1), and the loss of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) expression. Furthermore, long‑term exposure to NaAsIII induced the proliferation and compromised the response of MCF7 cells to tamoxifen (TAM). The in vitro exposure to NaAsIII induced BRCA1 CpG methylation associated with the increased recruitment of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and the loss of RNA polymerase II (PolII) at the BRCA1 gene. Xenografts of NaAsIII‑preconditioned MCF7 cells (MCF7NaAsIII) into the mammary fat pads of nude mice produced a larger tumor volume compared to tumors from control MCF7 cells and were more refractory to TAM in association with the reduced expression of BRCA1 and ERα, CpG hypermethylation of estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) and BRCA1, and the increased expression of FOLR1. These cumulative data support the hypothesis that exposure to AsIII may contribute to reducing the efficacy of endocrine therapy against ERα‑positive breast tumors by hampering the expression of ERα and BRCA1 via CpG methylation, respectively of ESR1 and BRCA1."
30664186,"RNA‑binding proteins (RBPs) play a fundamental role in the recurrence and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In this study, we identified muscleblind‑like 1 (MBNL1), an RBP implicated in developmental control, as a robust suppressor of CRC cell metastasis in vitro. By using a scratch assay coupled with time‑lapse live cell imaging, our findings revealed that the knockdown of MBNL1 induced epithelial‑to‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑like morphological changes in the HCT‑116 cells, accompanied by an enhanced cell motility, and by the downregulation of E‑cadherin and the upregulation of Snail expression. By contrast, the ectopic overexpression of MBNL1 suppressed EMT, characterized by the upregulation of E‑cadherin and the downregulation of Snail expression. Mechanistically, Snail rather than E‑cadherin, was identified as a direct downstream target gene of MBNL1. The ectopic the overexpression of MBNL1 markedly enhanced the recruitment of Snail transcripts to processing bodies (P‑bodies), leading to the increased degradation of Snail mRNA and consequent translational silencing. Furthermore, the effect of MBNL1 on CRC cell migration was confirmed in additional CRC cell lines. SW480 and HT‑29 cells exhibited similar changes in migratory capacity and the expression of Snail/E‑cadherin to those observed in HCT‑116 cells. On the whole, this study demonstrates that MBNL1 destabilizes Snail transcripts and, in turn, suppresses the EMT of CRC cells through the Snail/E‑cadherin axis in vitro. Therefore, this EMT‑related MBNL1/Snail/E‑cadherin axis may prove to be a novel therapeutic target for CRC metastasis."
30664157,"The present study aimed to investigate the biological function and underlying molecular mechanisms of miR-31 in osteoarthritis (OA). Reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to detect miR‑31 expression, and it was found that miR‑31 was downregulated in the cartilage tissues of OA patients. microRNA.org was used to predict the gene targets of miR‑31, and dual luciferase reporter assays were used to verify that C‑X‑C motif chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) was a direct target of miR‑31. The human chondrocyte cell line CHON‑001 was used to perform MTT and cell migration assays. Western blotting was used to measure the protein expression of CXCL12, type I collagen and aggrecan. The results suggested that CXCL12 was a target of miR‑31, and the expression of CXCL12 was negatively regulated by miR‑31 in CHON‑001 cells. miR‑31 increased CHON‑001 cell viability and migration, as well as the expression of type I collagen and aggrecan. Furthermore, the overexpression of CXCL12 eliminated the effects of miR‑31 mimics on CHON‑001 cells. In conclusion, the data indicated that miR‑31 promoted chondrocyte viability and migration by directly targeting CXCL12, which provided evidence for CXCL12 as a potential target in OA therapy."
30664150,"Temozolomide (TMZ) is an alkylating agent commonly used as a first‑line treatment for high‑grade glioblastoma. However, TMZ has short half‑life and frequently induces tumor resistance, which can limit its therapeutic efficiency. In the present study, it was hypothesized that combined treatment with TMZ and acteoside has synergistic effects in glioblastoma therapy. Using cell viability and wound‑healing assays, it was determined that this treatment regimen reduced cell viability and migration to a greater extent than either TMZ or acteoside alone. Following previous reports that TMZ affected autophagy in glioma cells, the present study examined the effects of TMZ + acteoside combination treatment on apoptosis and autophagy. The TMZ + acteoside combination treatment increased the cleavage of caspase‑3 and levels of B‑cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl‑2)‑associated X protein and phosphorylated p53, and decreased the level of Bcl‑2. The combination treatment increased microtubule‑associated protein 1 light chain 3 and apoptosis‑related gene expression. It was also determined that TMZ + acteoside induced apoptosis and autophagy through the mitogen‑activated protein kinase signaling pathway. These findings suggest that acteoside has beneficial effects on TMZ‑based glioblastoma therapy."
30664001,"Fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) and ultrasonography are the most common modalities for the diagnosis and follow up of thyroid nodules. FNAB is able to distinguish benign from malignant nodules with high sensitivity and specificity; however, 20% to 30% of nodules are diagnosed as indeterminate with a risk of malignancy varying from 10% to 75% based on the 2017 revision of the Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. Molecular tests are being increasingly used to triage this group of nodules. Several molecular tests are commercially available and newer upgrades are being developed to either ""rule in"" or ""rule out"" malignancy with greater accuracy. The Afirma gene expression classifier and its recent upgrade (the Afirma gene sequencing classifier), Thryoseq v2, a next generation sequencing test and its recent upgrade (the v3), RosettaGX Reveal based on microRNA alterations, and ThyGenX/ThyraMIR, a combination test, are currently on the market. Familiarity with these tests, their performance, and postvalidation publications will enable appropriate test selection and improve triage of patients for appropriate therapy. The underlying rate of malignancy at different institutions and the interobserver variability in cytologic and histologic diagnosis of thyroid lesions are important factors that impact the performance of the various molecular tests."
30663951,"The majority of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) in Australia is of the vanB genotype. An outbreak of vanA VREfm emerged in our haematology/oncology unit between November 2014 and May 2015. The first case of daptomycin non-susceptible E. faecium (DNSEfm) detected was a patient with vanA VREfm bacteraemia who showed clinical failure of daptomycin therapy, prompting microbiologic testing confirming daptomycin non-susceptibility."
30663928,Bacteriotherapy aimed at addressing dysbiosis may be therapeutic for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBDs). We sought to determine if defined Bacteroides-based bacteriotherapy could be an effective and consistent alternative to fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) in a murine model of IBD.
30663656,"The demonstration of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in treating chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) has heralded a new era in cancer therapeutics. However, a small population of cells does not respond to TKI treatment, resulting in minimal residual disease (MRD); even the most potent TKIs fail to eradicate these cells. These MRD cells serve as a reservoir to develop resistance to therapy. Why TKI treatment is ineffective against MRD cells is not known. Growth factor signaling is implicated in supporting the survival of MRD cells during TKI treatment, but a mechanistic understanding is lacking. Recent studies demonstrated that an elevated c-Fos and Dusp1 expression as a result of convergent oncogenic and growth factor signaling in MRD cells mediate TKI resistance. The genetic and chemical inhibition of c-Fos and Dusp1 renders CML exquisitely sensitive to TKIs and cures CML in both genetic and humanized mouse models. We identified these target genes using multiple microarrays from TKI-sensitive and -resistant cells. Here, we provide methods for target validation using in vitro and in vivo mouse models. These methods can easily be applied to any target for genetic validation and therapeutic development."
30663638,"Ethical regulations and technical challenges for research in human pathology, immunology, and therapeutic development have placed small animal models in high demand. With a close genetic and behavioral resemblance to humans, small animals such as the mouse are good candidates for human disease models, through which human-like symptoms and responses can be recapitulated. Further, the mouse genetic background can be altered to accommodate diverse demands. The NOD/SCID/IL2rγ<sup>null</sup> (NSG) mouse is one of the most widely used immunocompromised mouse strains; it allows engraftment with human hematopoietic stem cells and/or human tissues and the subsequent development of a functional human immune system. This is a critical milestone in understanding the prognosis and pathophysiology of human-specific diseases such as HIV/AIDS and aiding the search for a cure. Herein, we report a detailed protocol for generating a humanized NSG mouse model (hu-NSG) by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation into a radiation-conditioned neonatal NSG mouse. The hu-NSG mouse model shows multi-lineage development of transplanted human stem cells and susceptibility to HIV-1 viral infection. It also recapitulates key biological characteristics in response to combinatorial antiretroviral therapy (cART)."
30663491,"Platelets play important roles in vascular health. Activation of platelet may contribute to coagulation and inflammation. Evidence suggests circulating platelets are chronically activated in sickle cell disease (SCD) patients with steady state and further activated in vaso-occlusive crisis. However, the molecular basis of sickle platelet dysfunction remains obscure. Here, we used weighted gene coexpression network analysis combined with differentially expressed genes (DEGs) analysis to further investigate this basis. We found 57 DEGs were closely related to platelet dysfunction in SCD. Enrichment analysis showed that these 57 genes were mostly related to protein synthesis, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase activity and inflammation, suggesting a hyperactivation status of platelets in SCD. We identified six hub genes from the 57 DEGs according to their Gene Significance value ranking, including CRYM, CCT6P1, SUCNR1, PRKAB2, GSTM3 and FCGR2C. Altogether, our results offered some new insight into platelet activation and identified novel potential targets for antiplatelet therapy in SCD."

30662937,"Adoptive transfer of T cells expressing a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is a promising cell-based anticancer therapy. Although clinical studies of this approach show therapeutic efficacy, additional genetic modification is necessary to enhance the efficacy and safety of CAR-T cells. For example, production of an antitumor cytokine from CAR-T cells can potentially enhance their tumor-killing activity, but there are concerns that constitutive expression of anticancer molecules will cause systemic side effects. Therefore, it is important that exogenous gene expression is confined to the tumor locality. Here, we aimed to develop an inducible promoter driven by activation signals from a CAR. Transgene expression in T cells transduced with the CD19-targeted CAR and an inducible promoter, including inducible reporter genes (CAR-T/iReporter), was only induced strongly by co-culture with CD19-positive target cells. CAR-T/iReporter cells also showed redirected cytolysis toward CD19-positive, but not CD19-negative, tumor cells. Overall, our study indicated that the inducible promoter was selectively driven by activation signals from the CAR, and transduction with the inducible promoter did not affect original effector activities including interleukin-2 and interferon-γ production and the antitumor activity of CAR-redirected cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Moreover, this inducible promoter permits visualization and quantification of the activation status in CAR-T cells."
30662813,"Incense burning is common in Asian countries due to the religious beliefs. Environmental exposure to incense burning smoke is a potential risk factor for tumor development and progression of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Eastern Asia ethnic origin is strongly associated the clinical benefits of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in NSCLC patients. However, the impact of the oriental custom of incense burning on the cancer progression and the EGFR TKI-sensitivity of NSCLC remains unclear. Our results showed that long-term exposure to incense burning extract (IBE) increases the cellular proliferation with S phase accumulation and the motility activity of NSCLCs. Interestingly, IBE enhances EGFR signaling activity without affecting its genetic status, and increases the cellular sensitivity of NSCLC cell lines to EGFR TKIs. Auramine, a yellow dye for making incense sticks, was identified as a residual composition in the burning incense smoke, and showed similar EGFR TKI-sensitizing effects. Furthermore, IBE or auramine transcriptionally induce EGFR ligand amphiregulin (AREG) expression for the enhancement of EGFR activity. Neutralization of AREG reduced the viability of IBE-treated cells. These results indicated that exposure to incent smoke may enhance NSCLC progression and their sensitivity to EGFR TKIs through increasing their oncogenic addiction to AREG-induced EGFR signaling."
30662669,"Cisplatin is the first-line chemotherapy drug for gastric cancer (GC), but treatment failure often occurs due to development of resistance. The mechanism of cisplatin resistance remains a mystery. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 5A2 (eIF5A2) is an important tumor-promoting factor and has been rarely studied in GC. This study aimed to investigate the role of eIF5A2 in cisplatin resistance of GC cells and its relationship with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). We found that it is negative correlation between cisplatin resistance and eIF5A2's expression in GC cells. Silencing of eIF5A2 enhanced the sensitivity of GC cells to cisplatin, while overexpression of eIF5A2 decreased sensitivity. Cisplatin treatment induced gene expression changes consistent with EMT. EMT was blocked and the sensitivity of GC cells to cisplatin was increased by inhibiting the expression of Twist, indicating that EMT regulates the sensitivity of GC cells to cisplatin. Knockdown of eIF5A2 was associated with upregulation of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and β-catenin, while the expression of mesenchymal markers vimentin and N-cadherin decreased, indicating that eIF5A2 can reverse the EMT process and block the effect of cisplatin on EMT-related markers. Knockdown or overexpression of eIF5A2 did not affect the sensitivity of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin by Twist siRNA. Altogether, these data suggest that eIF5A2 regulates the resistance of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin by mediating EMT, and support the conclusion that eIF5A2 may be a molecular target for anti-tumor therapy."
30662658,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major life-threatening malignancy worldwide. HCC has an unfavorable prognosis, mainly due to late diagnosis, early metastasis, and post-surgical recurrence. Recent studies have demonstrated that beta-lactamases (LACTB) plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis and progression of several malignant tumors, but its expression and functional role in HCC has not been reported. In this study, we explored the expression of LACTB using The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets and two independent tissues microarrays. We then analyzed the correlation between LACTB expression and clinical outcomes in HCC. We demonstrated that LACTB mRNA and protein levels were both down-regulated in HCC, and decreased LACTB expression was associated with TNM stage, histologic grade, and overall survival of patients. Additionally, through Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, we found that the genes negatively related to the survival of HCC patients were enriched in the low LACTB expression group. Furthermore, we confirmed that overexpression of LACTB inhibited HCC cell proliferation, invasion, and migration <i>in vitro</i>, as well as decreased tumor growth <i>in vivo</i>. Online prediction results suggested that the LACTB gene was markedly correlated with genes involved in the lipid metabolism pathway. In conclusion, these findings suggest that down-regulated LACTB could function as a novel biomarker for diagnosis and prognosis prediction, and LACTB could serve as a promising target in HCC therapy."
30662653,"AMPK-related kinase 5 (ARK5) is a member of the human AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family, which is associated with increased tumor survival and drug resistance in many cancers. However, the function of ARK5 in pancreatic carcinoma (PC) is unclear. Our study investigated the role of ARK5 in the chemo-resistance of PC and its underlying mechanism. PC cell lines that displayed high expression levels of ARK5 had low sensitivity to gemcitabine (GEM). Suppression of ARK5 increased sensitivity to GEM in PC cell lines. Western blotting and immunofluorescence showed that suppression of ARK5 upregulated expression of E-cadherin and downregulated vimentin expression. Suppression of ARK5 also inhibited the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) efficiency associated with GEM in PC cell lines and upregulation of ARK5 expression enhanced GEM resistance in PC cell lines by inducing Twist-mediated EMT. In addition, we found that suppression of ARK5 increased GEM sensitivity in PC cell lines under hypoxic conditions. ARK5 increases GEM resistance in PC cell lines via EMT, and suppression of ARK5 increases sensitivity to GEM under both normoxic and hypoxic conditions."
30662645,"Hyperhomocysteinemia is an independent risk factor for multiple cardiovascular diseases. The pathogenesis of homocysteine-induced vascular remodeling has not yet been elucidated. <i>In vivo</i>, we established hyperhomocysteinemia model with high L-methionine diet and found that the accumulation of macrophages, proliferation of VSMCs and decreased expression of A20 in the aorta of mice fed with high methionine diet. <i>In vitro</i>, we found that the overexpression of A20 suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p65 and attenuated homocysteine-induced proliferation and migration of VSMCs. However, down-regulation of A20 reversed the protective effects above. Moreover, A20 attenuated homocysteine-induced vascular remodeling by alleviating the activation of inflammation and suppressing the proliferation and migration of VSMCs through enhanced nuclear translocation of IRF3 and binding to PPAR-γ."
30662633,"Here, we describe the case of a motor developmental disorder associated with intellectual disability accompanied by <i>MYH2</i> mutations (c.2266G>A and c.4258C>T) in a female child in China. Her initial detailed functional rehabilitation evaluation gauged motor skills, balance, verbal language, and daily living skills. A general therapy plan was then established to enhance balance, muscle strength in the lower extremities, walking, gross and fine motor function, and family education. Clinicians and therapists later modified her rehabilitation regimen after her <i>MYH2</i> mutations were identified by adding specific mobility and endurance exercise to the original plan. The clinical remission of myopathy with <i>MYH2</i> missense mutations was observed in the patient after this targeted rehabilitation, indicating that precision therapy is very effective for developing a suitable rehabilitation program for patients with unexplained myopathies."
30662625,"The knowledge of individual response to a therapy, which can be assesed by <i>in vitro</i> screening, is essential for the development of therapeutics. Chaperone therapy is based on the ability of small molecules to fold the mutant protein to recover its function. As a novel approach for the treatment of Gaucher disease (GD), ambroxol was recently identified as a chaperone for GD, caused by the pathogenic variants in <i>GBA</i> gene, resulting in lysosomal enzyme glucocerebrosidase (GCase) deficiency. Since ambroxol activity is mutation-dependent, the assessment of the chaperone action requires adaptation of a cell model with genetic format identical to the patient. We compared the chaperone activity of ambroxol using different primary cells derived from GD patients with different <i>GBA</i> genotypes. Ambroxol enhanced GCase activity in cells with wild type <i>GBA</i> and in those, compound heterozygous for N370S, but was ineffective in cell lines with complex GBA alleles. In cells from patients with neuropathic GD and L444P/L444P genotype, the response to ambroxol was varied. We conclude that chaperone activity depends on diverse factors in addition to a particular <i>GBA</i> genotype. We showed that PBMCs and macrophages are the most relevant cell-based methods to screen the efficacy of ambroxol therapy. For pediatric patients, a non-invasive source of primary cells, urine derived kidney epithelial cells, have a vast potential for drug screening in GD. These findings demonstrate the importance of personalized screening to evaluate efficacy of chaperone therapy, especially in patients with neuronopathic GD."
30662543,"Small cell carcinoma of the ovary, hypercalcemic type (SCCOHT) is a highly aggressive cancer in young women. The histogenesis remains unclear although a potential origin of germ cells has been suggested recently. The high throughput next generation sequencing techniques have facilitated the identification of inactivating SMARCA4 mutations as the driver of SCCOHT. These findings may greatly impact on the prevention, diagnosis, molecular classification and treatment of SCCOHTs. The SMARCA4 mutations, typically associated with dual loss of BRG1 and BRM expression, are highly sensitive and specific for the diagnosis of SCCOHT. Germline mutations of SMARCA4 support familial SCCOHT with a critical requirement of genetic counseling and possible prophylactic surgery for carriers. SCCOHT, malignant atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, thoracic sarcomas and some undifferentiated carcinomas harbor rhabdoid morphology and mutations in the SMARC genes, generating an emerging molecular classification of SMARC-mutated tumors. A multi-modality treatment approach consisting of surgery and high dose multi-agent chemotherapy in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors may have potential benefits for SCCOHT patients. Preliminary studies have implicated that the inhibitors targeting EZH2 and the receptor tyrosine kinase, and anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy might be potentially effective for SCCOHT patients. These recent advances on molecular genetics, diagnosis and treatment of SCCOHT address the necessity of multiple institutional collaboration work among oncologist, pathologist, genomic scientist, geneticist, molecular biologist, and pharmacologist."
30662526,A number of mutations in key oncogenes have been identified as important for the initiation and maintenance of lung adenocarcinoma (LAC).

30662466,"The immunomodulatory and self-renewable features of human adipose mesenchymal stem cells (hAD-MSCs) mark their importance in regenerative medicine. Interleukin 23 (IL- 23) as a proinflammatory cytokine suppresses T regulatory cells (Treg) and promotes the response of T helper 17 (Th17) and T helper 1 (Th1) cells. This pathway starts inflammation and immunosuppression in several autoimmune diseases. The current study for producing recombinant IL- 23 decoy receptor (RIL- 23R) using hAD-MSCs as a good candidate for ex vivo cell-based gene therapy purposes reducing inflammation in autoimmune diseases. hAD-MSCs was isolated from lipoaspirate and then characterized by differentiation. RIL- 23R was designed and cloned into a pCDH-813A- 1 lentiviral vector. The transduction of hAD-MSCs was performed at MOI (multiplicity of infection) = 50 with pCDH- EFI <i>α</i>- RIL- 23R- PGK copGFP. Expressions of RIL- 23R and octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (OCT- 4) were determined by real-time polymerase chain reaction (real time-PCR). Self-renewing properties were assayed with OCT- 4. Bioactivity of the designed RIL- 23R was evaluated by IL- 17 and IL- 10 expression of mouse splenocytes. Cell differentiation confirmed the true isolation of hAD-MSCs from lipoaspirate. Restriction of the enzyme digestion and sequencing verified the successful cloning of RIL- 23R in the CD813A-1 lentiviral vector. The green fluorescent protein (GFP) positive transduction rate was up to 90%, and real-time PCR showed the expression level of RIL-23R. Oct-4 had a similar expression pattern with nontransduced hAD-MSCs and transduced hAD-MSCs/ RIL-23R indicating that lentiviral vector did not affect hAD-MSCs characteristics. Downregulation of IL-17 and upregulation of IL-10 showed the correct activity of the engineered hAD-MSCs. The results showed that the transduced hAD-MSCs/ RIL- 23R, expressing IL-23 decoy receptor, can give a useful approach for a basic research on cell-based gene therapy for autoimmune disorders."
30662451,"Artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been utilized for classification and prediction task with remarkable accuracy. However, its implications for unsupervised data mining using molecular data is under-explored. We found that embedding can extract biologically relevant information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) gene expression dataset by learning a vector representation through gene co-occurrence. Ground truth relationship, such as cancer types of the input sample and semantic meaning of genes, were showed to retain in the resulting entity matrices. We also demonstrated the interpretability and usage of these matrices in shortlisting candidates from a long gene list as in the case of immunotherapy response. 73 related genes are singled out while the relatedness of 55 genes with immune checkpoint proteins (PD-1, PD-L1, and CTLA-4) are supported by literature. 16 novel genes (<i>ACAP1, C11orf45, CD79B, CFP, CLIC2, CMPK2, CXCR2P1, CYTIP, FER, MCTO1, MMP25, RASGEF1B, SLFN12, TBC1D10C, TRAF3IP3, TTC39B</i>) related to immune checkpoint proteins were identified. Thus, this method is feasible to mine big volume of biological data, and embedding would be a valuable tool to discover novel knowledge from omics data. The resulting embedding matrices mined from TCGA gene expression data are interactively explorable online (http://bit.ly/tcga-embedding-cancer) and could serve as an informative reference for gene relatedness in the context of cancer and is readily applicable to biomarker discovery of any molecular targeted therapy."
30662343,"To evaluate the antitumor effect of sinoporphyrin sodium mediated photodynamic therapy (DVDMS-PDT) against human colorectal cancer (CRC) and to investigate the role of autophagy in its effect. Shrunken cells, condensed nuclei and increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and Bax were observed in DVDMS-PDT treated HCT116 cells, reminiscent of apoptosis. DVDMS-PDT showed better antitumor efficiency in HCT116 cells than Photofrin mediated photodynamic therapy (PF-PDT) both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. And DVDMS-PDT caused autophagic characteristics: double membrane autophagosome structures and changes in autophagy-related protein expression (ATG7, P62, Bcl-2 and LC3-Ⅱ). In addition, inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine (CQ) promoted apoptosis, suggesting a possible protective role of autophagy in DVDMS-PDT-treated HCT116 cells, which was proved by flow cytometry and western blotting. The results of xenograft mouse model showed markedly increased apoptosis and significantly reduced tumor size in DVDMS-PDT treated group than Control, and DVDMS-PDT exhibited better antitumor efficiency than PF-PDT. Further, no visible tumor was observed in the CQ+DVDMS-PDT group at the end of the xenograft mouse experiment, which confirmed the hypothesis that autophagy was protective to DVDMS-PDT treated HCT116 cells. Our findings suggest that DVDMS is a promising photosensitizer and the combined use of autophagy inhibitor can remarkably enhance the DVDMS-PDT mediated anti-cancer efficiency in HCT116 cells both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>."
30662324,"<b>Introduction:</b> Most chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients in China are primitively treated with a combination of lamivudine (LAM) and adefovir dipivoxil (ADV). Although antiviral resistance can be avoided with this combination therapy, using it can have harmful side effects related to ADV, specifically kidney and bone injury. This study was designed to compare viral suppression and kidney safety when switching LAM and ADV combination therapy <i>de novo</i> to entecavir (ETV) monotherapy in patients with CHB and compensated hepatic cirrhosis. <b>Materials and methods:</b> In total, 360 CHB and compensated liver cirrhosis patients who received treatment of LAM and ADV combination therapy for more than 1 year were included in this study. One hundred and eighty patients continued combination therapy to serve as a control group and the other 180 patients were switched to ETV monotherapy to serve as the experimental group. The total course of therapy was 3 years. Laboratory studies were done every 3 months to measure liver and kidney function. Studies included glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), HBV-DNA, urine β2-microglobulin (β2-M) and retinol binding protein (RBP). <b>Results:</b> In the experimental group, an HBV-DNA level below 20 IU/ml was found in 77.65%, 85.88%, and 94.77% in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In the control group, HBV-DNA levels were below 20 IU/ml in 69.66%, 75.42%, and 85.80% in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Low HBV-DNA levels in the experimental group were significantly less common than in the control group on the second and third year; <i>P</i> values were 0.009 and 0.006 for years 2 and 3, respectively. The cumulative genetic mutation rate was 3.49% in the experimental group and 8.88% in the control group (<i>P</i>=0.044). Decreases in eGFR more than 30% from baseline were found in 0%, 0.56%, and 1.74% of patients in the experimental group and 4.49%, 9.14% and 14.79% in patients in the control group in the first, second, and third year, respectively. Serum creatinine more than 50 μmol/L above baseline was found in 0%, 0% and 1.74% of patients in the experimental group and 1.12%, 4.00% and 5.32% of patients in the control group in years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The urine β2-M and RBP levels were abnormal more often in the experimental group than in the control group. <b>Conclusion:</b> Switching to ETV monotherapy can decrease HBV-DNA levels, reduce the genetic mutation rate, and prevent renal damage caused by LAM and ADV combination therapy in patients with CHB and compensated liver cirrhosis. Patients receiving LAM and ADV combination therapy <i>de novo</i> should be switched to ETV monotherapy immediately."

30661994,"The hostile environment of an injured spinal cord makes it challenging to achieve higher viability in a grafted tissue-engineered neural network used to reconstruct the spinal cord circuit. Here, we investigate whether cell survival and synaptic transmission within an NT-3 and TRKC gene-overexpressing neural stem cell-derived neural network scaffold (NN) transplanted into transected spinal cord could be promoted by electroacupuncture (EA) through improving the microenvironment. Our results showed that EA facilitated the cell survival, neuronal differentiation, and synapse formation of a transplanted NN. Pseudorabies virus tracing demonstrated that EA strengthened synaptic integration of the transplanted NN with the host neural circuit. The combination therapy also promoted axonal regeneration, spinal conductivity, and functional recovery. The findings highlight EA as a potential and safe supplementary therapeutic strategy to reinforce the survival and synaptogenesis of a transplanted NN as a neuronal relay to bridge the two severed ends of an injured spinal cord."
30661654,"The finalization of the Human Genome Project in 2003 paved the way for a deeper understanding of cancer, favouring a faster progression towards ""personalized"" medicine. Research in oncology has progressively focused on the sequencing of cancer genomes, to better understand the genetic basis of tumorigenesis and identify actionable alterations to guide cancer therapy. Thanks to the development of next-generation-sequencing (NGS) techniques, sequencing of tumoral DNA is today technically easier, faster and cheaper. Commercially available NGS panels enable the detection of single or global genomic alterations, namely gene mutation and mutagenic burden, both on germline and somatic DNA, potentially predicting the response or resistance to cancer treatments. Profiling of tumor DNA is nowadays a standard in cancer research and treatment. In this review we discuss the history, techniques and applications of NGS in cancer care, under a ""personalized tailored therapy"" perspective."
30661213,"The proto-oncogene KRAS belongs among the most frequently mutated genes in all types of cancer and is also very important oncogene related to colorectal tumors. The detection of mutations in this gene in primary tumor is a predictive biomarker for the anti-EGFR therapy in metastatic CRC (mCRC); however, the patients with wild-type KRAS can also show resistance to the personalized medicine. The droplet-based digital PCR technology has improved the analytical sensitivity of the mutations detection, which led us to the idea about the optimization of this approach for KRAS testing. In this study, we report the application of ddPCR technology in order to analyze the presence of KRAS mutations in primary tumor and matched metastasis in lymph nodes (LNs) from patients with mCRC and address the question, whether the improvement in the detection method can lower the discrepancies of KRAS mutations detection between the primary tumor and regional LNs. Genomic DNA with wtKRAS and commercial DNA with mtKRAS (G12D) were used to set up the ddPCR reaction. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues from primary tumor and positive lymph node from 31 patients with mCRC were analyzed using ddPCR and Sanger sequencing. KRAS status of primary tumors was known; however, the mutation status of lymph nodes was not detected previously. From 31 samples of primary tumors, our results corresponded to results from IVD kit in 30 cases. For one patient, ddPCR detected KRAS mutation in comparison with negative result of the IVD kit. In the samples of metastatic infiltrated LNs, ddPCR detected 16 samples as a WT KRAS and 15 lymph nodes showed positivity for KRAS mutation, whereby Sanger sequencing found KRAS mutations in 8 cases only. We also found two cases where genetic conditions of KRAS gene differed between primary tumor and infiltrated lymph node, both ""low-grade"" adenocarcinoma. Our study approved that ddPCR method is adequate technique with high sensitivity and in the future may be used as a diagnostic tool for evaluation of KRAS mutations, especially in infiltrated LNs of patients with mCRC."

30660961,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a heterogeneous group of fast growing cancers of myeloid progenitor cells, for which effective treatments are still lacking. Identification of signaling inhibitors that block their proliferation could reveal the proliferative mechanism of a given leukemia cell, and provide small molecule drugs for targeted therapy for AML. In this study, kinase inhibitors that block the majority of cancer signaling pathways are evaluated for their inhibition of two AML cell lines of the M5 subtypes, CTV-1 and THP-1. While THP-1 cells do not respond to any of these inhibitors, CTV-1 cells are potently inhibited by dasatinib, bosutinib, crizotinib, A-770041, and WH-4-23, all potent inhibitors for Lck, a Src family kinase. CTV-1 cells contain a kinase activity that phosphorylates an Lck-specific peptide substrate in an Lck inhibitor-sensitive manner. Furthermore, the Lck gene is over-expressed in CTV-1, and it contains four mutations, two of which are located in regions critical for Lck negative regulation, and are confirmed to activate Lck. Collectively, these results provide strong evidence that mutated and overexpressed Lck is driving CTV-1 proliferation. While Lck activation and overexpression is rare in AML, this study provides a potential therapeutic strategy for treating patients with a similar oncogenic mechanism."
30660796,"Lung cancer patients with tumors harboring actionable alterations can achieve very durable responses to first-line targeted therapy. However, identifying targetable alterations using next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a complex and time-intensive process.

30660753,"Cytochrome B is the mitochondrial protein, which functions as part of the electron transport chain and is the main subunit of transmembrane cytochrome bc1 and b6f complexes affecting energy metabolism through oxidative phosphorylation. The present study was conducted to study the effect of mutation of Cytochrome B gene on the health condition of sheep, which the first report of association of mitochondrial gene with disease traits in livestock species. Non-synonymous substitutions (F33 L and D171N) and Indel mutations were observed for Cytochrome B gene, leading to a truncated protein, where anemia, malfunctioning of most of the vital organs as liver, kidney and mineral status was observed and debility with exercise intolerance and cardiomyopathy in extreme cases were depicted. These findings were confirmed by bioinformatics analysis, haematological and biochemical data analysis, and other phenotypical physiological data pertaining to different vital organs. The molecular mechanism of cytochrome B mutation was that the mutant variant interferes with the site of heme binding (iron containing) domain and calcium binding essential for electron transport chain. Mutation at amino acid site 33 is located within transmembrane helix A, a hydrophobic environment at the Qi site and close to heme binding domain, and mutation effects these domain and diseases occur. Thermodynamic stability was also observed to decrease in mutant variant. Sheep Cytochrome B being genetically more similar to the human, it may be used as a model for studying human diseases related to cytochrome B defects. Future prospect of the study includes the therapeutic application of recombinant protein, gene therapy and marker-assisted selection of disease-resistant livestock."
30660730,"In the previous decade, comprehensive genomic analyses have yielded important insights about the genetic alterations that underlie pancreatic tumorigenesis. Whole exome and whole genome sequencing of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas have confirmed the critical driver genes altered in the majority of pancreatic cancers, as well as identifying numerous less frequently altered driver genes and has delineated cancer subgroups with unique biological and clinical features. It is now appreciated that pancreatic susceptibility gene alterations are often identified in patients with pancreatic cancer without family histories suggestive of a familial cancer syndrome, prompting recent efforts to expand gene testing to all patients with pancreatic cancer. Studies of pancreatic cancer precursor lesions have begun to elucidate the evolutionary history of pancreatic tumorigenesis and help to understand the utility of biomarkers for early detection as well as targets to develop new therapeutic strategies. In this review, we discuss the results of comprehensive genomic characterization of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma and its precursor lesions, and we highlight translational applications in early detection and therapy."
30660679,"DNA methylation is a well-defined epigenetic modification that regulates gene transcription. However, the role of DNA methylation in the cardiac hypertrophy seen in hypertension is unclear. This study was performed to investigate genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), and the cardioprotective effect of choline. Eight-week-old male SHRs received intraperitoneal injections of choline (8 mg/kg/day) for 8 weeks. SHRs showed aberrant methylation distribution on chromosomes and genome regions, with decreased methylation levels at CHG and CHH sites. A total of 91,559 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected between SHRs and WKY rats, of which 28,197 were demethylated and 63,362 were methylated. Choline treatment partly restored the DMRs in SHRs, which were related to 131 genes. Gene ontology analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis of DMRs suggested that choline partly reversed the dysfunctions of biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions in SHRs. Moreover, the inhibition of 2-oxoglutarate accumulation by choline, thereby inhibiting excessive activation of ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase enzymes, may correlate with the beneficial effects of choline on methylation levels, cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac function of SHRs, as indicated by decreased heart rate and blood pressure, and increased ejection fraction and fractional shortening. This study provides the first genome-wide DNA methylation profile of the hypertrophic myocardium of SHRs and suggests a novel role for this epigenetic modification in hypertension. Choline treatment may represent a promising approach for modification of DNA methylation and optimization of the epigenetic profile for antihypertensive therapy."

In addition, the high prevalence of viral infections in this population exposes patients to an increased risk of CKD. The risk of hemorrhage in hemophiliac patients is a challenge for their clinical management, both for diagnostic procedures (kidney biopsy in particular) and for renal replacement therapy (dialysis or renal transplantation) when it is needed. This work provides an update of the literature data concerning the management of hemophiliac patients in nephrology, illustrated by the cases of two patients."
30660184,"Antibiotic therapy is commonly used in animal agriculture. Antibiotics excreted by the animals can contaminate farming environments, resulting in long term exposure of animals to sub-inhibitory levels of antibiotics. Little is known on the effect of this exposure on antibiotic resistance. In this study, we aimed to investigate the long term effects of sub-inhibitory levels of antibiotics on the gut microbiota composition and resistome of veal calves in vivo. Forty-two veal calves were randomly assigned to three groups. The first group (OTC-high) received therapeutic oral dosages of 1 g oxytetracycline (OTC), twice per day, during 5 days. The second group (OTC-low) received an oral dose of OTC of 100-200 μg per day during 7 weeks, mimicking animal exposure to environmental contamination. The third group (CTR) did not receive OTC, serving as unexposed control. Antibiotic residue levels were determined over time. The temporal effects on the gut microbiota and antibiotic resistance gene abundance was analysed by metagenomic sequencing."
30660010,"Myocardial infarction (MI) leads to the loss of cardiomyocytes, left ventricle (LV) dilation, and cardiac dysfunction, eventually developing into heart failure. Most of the strategies for MI therapy require biomaterials that can support tissue regeneration. In this study, we hypothesized that the extracellular matrix (ECM)-derived collagen I hydrogel loaded with histone deacetylase 7 (HDAC7)-derived-phosphorylated 7-amino-acid peptide (7Ap) could restrain LV remodeling and improve cardiac function after MI. An MI model was established by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) of C57/B6 mice. The 7Ap-loaded collagen I hydrogel was intramyocardially injected to the infarcted region of the LV wall of the heart. After local delivery, the 7Ap-collagen increased neo-microvessel formation, enhanced stem cell antigen-1 positive (Sca-1<sup>+</sup>) stem cell recruitment and differentiation, decreased cellular apoptosis, and promoted cardiomyocyte cycle progression. Furthermore, the 7Ap-collagen restricted the fibrosis of the LV wall, reduced the infarct wall thinning, and improved cardiac performance significantly at 2 weeks post-MI. These results highlight the promising implication of 7Ap-collagen as a novel candidate for MI therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The mammalian myocardium has a limited regenerative capability following myocardial infarction (MI). MI leads to extensive loss of cardiomyocytes, thus culminating in adverse cardiac remodeling and congestive heart failure. In situ tissue regeneration through endogenous cell mobilization has great potential for tissue regeneration. A 7-amino-acid-peptide (7A) domain encoded by a short open-reading frame (sORF) of the HDAC7 gene. The phosphorylated from of 7A (7Ap) has been reported to promote in situ tissue repair via the mobilization and recruitment of endogenous stem cell antigen-1 positive (Sca-l<sup>+</sup>) stem cells. In this study, 7Ap was shown to improve H9C2 cell survival, in vitro. In vivo investigations in a mouse MI model demonstrated that intra-myocardial delivery of 7Ap-loaded collagen hydrogel promoted neovascularization, stimulated Sca-l<sup>+</sup> stem cell recruitment and differentiation, reduced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and promoted cell cycle progression. As a result, treated infarcted hearts had increased wall thickness, had improved heart function and exhibited attenuation of adverse cardiac remodeling, observed for up to 2 weeks. Overall, these results highlighted the positive impact of implanting 7Ap-collagen as a novel constituent for MI repair."
30660009,"Low back pain is often caused by intervertebral disc degeneration, which is characterized by nucleus pulposus (NP) and extracellular matrix (ECM) degeneration. Human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) induced by growth and differentiation factor-5 (GDF5) can differentiate into an NP-like phenotype. Although stem cell-based therapy with prolonged exposure to growth factors is regarded as a promising treatment, the efficacy of this approach in attenuating the disc degeneration process is limited by the short lifespan of growth factors. In our study, a unique growth factor delivery vehicle composed of heparin and the synthetic polycation poly(ethylene argininylaspartate diglyceride) (PEAD) was used to sustain GDF5 release. The results showed that sustained release of GDF5 by the PEAD:heparin delivery system promoted hADSC differentiation to an NP-like phenotype in vitro. After injection of the PEAD:heparin:GDF5 delivery platform and hADSCs into intervertebral spaces of coccygeal (Co) vertebrae Co7/Co8 and Co8/Co9 of the rat, the disc height, water content, and structure of the NPs decreased more slowly than other treatment groups. This new strategy may be used as an alternative treatment for attenuating intervertebral disc degeneration with hADSCs without the need for gene therapy.

Numerous groups have explored IDD regeneration methods in vitro and in vivo. Our study differs in that GDF5 was incorporated into a vehicle through charge attraction and exhibited a sustained release profile. Moreover, GDF-5 seeded coacervate combined with hADSC injection could be a minimally invasive approach for tissue engineering that is suitable for clinical application. We investigated the stimulatory effects of our GDF-5 seeded coacervate on the differentiation of ADSCs in vitro and the reparative effect of the delivery system on degenerated NP in vivo."
30659978,"Cellular senescence refers to a process induced by various types of stress that causes irreversible cell cycle arrest and distinct cellular alterations, including profound changes in gene expression, metabolism, and chromatin organization as well as activation/reinforcement of anti-apoptotic pathways and development of a pro-inflammatory secretome or senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP). However, because of challenges and technical limitations in identifying and characterizing senescent cells in living organisms, only recently have some of the diverse in vivo roles of these unique cells been discovered. New findings indicate that senescent cells and their SASP can have acute beneficial functions, such as in tissue regeneration and wound healing. However, in contrast, when senescent cells accumulate in excess chronically at sites of pathology or in old tissues they drive multiple age-associated chronic diseases. Senotherapeutics that selectively eliminate senescent cells (""senolytics"") or inhibit their detrimental SASP (""senomorphics"") have been developed and tested in aged preclinical models. These studies have established that targeting senescence is a powerful anti-aging strategy to improve ""healthspan"" - i.e., the healthy period of life free of chronic disease. The roles of senescence in mediating age-related bone loss have been a recent focus of rigorous investigation. Studies in mice and humans demonstrate that with aging, at least a subset of most cell types in the bone microenvironment become senescent and develop a heterogeneous SASP. Furthermore, age-related bone loss can be alleviated in old mice, with apparent advantages over anti-resorptive therapy, by reducing the senescent cell burden genetically or pharmacologically with the first class of senolytics or a senomorphic. Collectively, these findings point to targeting senescence as a transformational strategy to extend healthspan, therefore providing strong rationale for identifying and optimizing senotherapeutics to alleviate multiple chronic diseases of aging, including osteoporosis, and set the stage for translating senotherapeutics to humans, with clinical trials currently ongoing."
30659533,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), now the leading cause of liver damage worldwide, is epidemiologically associated with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, and is a potentially progressive condition to advanced liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, there is a huge interindividual variability in liver disease susceptibility. Inherited factors play also an important role in determining disease predisposition. During the last years, common variants in PNPLA3, TM6SF2, MBOAT7 and GCKR have been demonstrated to predispose to the full spectrum of NAFLD pathology by facilitating hepatic fat accumulation in the presence of environmental triggers. Other variants regulating inflammation and fibrogenesis then modulate liver disease progression in those at higher risk. Evidence is also accumulating that rare variants may be involved in disease predisposition. In the future, evaluation of genetic risk factors may be exploited to stratify the risk of liver-related complications of the disease, and to guide hepatocellular carcinoma surveillance and choose pharmacological therapy."
30659409,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are a promising strategy in the treatment of cancer, especially advanced types. However, not all patients are responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

The cellular mechanisms by which energy loss and inhibition of effector function occur in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) are ill-defined, and methods to identify tumor-antigen-specific TILs that experience such stress are unknown. Processes upstream of the mitochondria guide cell-intrinsic energy depletion. We hypothesized that a mechanism of T cell-intrinsic energy consumption was the process of oxidative protein folding and disulfide-bond formation that takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) guided by protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and downstream PERK axis target ER oxidoreductase 1 (ERO1α). To test this hypothesis, we created TCR transgenic mice with a T cell-specific PERK gene deletion (OT1+Lckcre+PERKf/f, PERK KO). We found that PERK KO and T cells that were pharmacologically inhibited by PERK or ERO1α maintained reserve energy and exhibited a protein profile consistent with reduced oxidative stress. These T cell groups displayed superior tumor control compared to T effectors. We identified a biomarker of ER-induced mitochondrial exhaustion in T cells as mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS), and found that PD-1+ tumor antigen-specific CD8+ TILs express mtROS. In vivo treatment with a PERK inhibitor abrogated mtROS in PD-1+ CD8+ TILs and bolstered CD8+ TIL viability. Combination therapy enabled 100% survival and 71% tumor clearance in a sarcoma mouse model. Our data identify the ER as a regulator of T cell energetics and indicate that ER elements are effective targets to improve cancer immunotherapy."
30658988,"In rare diseases, health-related quality of life (HRQL) data can be difficult to capture. Given the ultrarare nature of <i>RPE65</i>-mediated inherited retinal disease (IRD), it was not feasible to recruit a patient sample and collect HRQL data prospectively. The objectives of this study were to develop health state descriptions of <i>RPE65</i>-mediated IRD, and to estimate associated patient utilities."
30658734,"While liver transplantation (LT) has become a standard therapy for life-threatening alcohol related cirrhosis, LT as a treatment for severe alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has remained a taboo owing to concerns about the limited organ supply and the risk that the AH liver recipient will return to harmful drinking. The adoption of a 6-month abstinence requirement (the so-called '6-month rule') by many centres made AH a contraindication to LT. Given the high short-term mortality of severe AH, the lack of effective medical therapies and an increasing recognition that the 6-month rule unfairly excluded otherwise favourable candidates, a seminal European pilot study of LT for AH was performed. The success of the European study, which has been corroborated in retrospective analyses from the United States, represented a paradigm shift in therapy for highly selected patients with severe AH who are not responding to medical therapy. However, prospective studies are urgently needed to resolve the controversies that still surround the criteria for selection of patients with AH for LT and the long-term outcomes of the associated alcohol use disorder."
30658596,"Major symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are chronic bronchitis and emphysema leading from lung tissue destruction, that is an effect of an imbalance between metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their tissue inhibitors activity. As potential factor involved in this COPD pathogenesis, MMP-12 is considered. We investigated the role of genetic polymorphism and protein level of MMP-12 in the COPD development among Poles."
30658513,"Direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) have shown an upward prescribing trend in recent years due to favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics without requirement for routine coagulation monitoring. However, recent studies have documented inter-individual variability in plasma drug levels of DOACs. Pharmacogenomics of DOACs is a relatively new area of research. There is a need to understand the role of pharmacogenomics in the interpatient variability of the four most commonly prescribed DOACs, namely dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. We performed an extensive search of recently published research articles including clinical trials and in-vitro studies in PubMed, particularly those focusing on genetic loci, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and DNA polymorphisms, and their effect on inter-individual variation of DOACs. Additionally, we also focused on commonly associated drug-drug interactions of DOACs. CES1 and ABCB1 SNPs are the most common documented genetic variants that contribute to alteration in peak and trough levels of dabigatran with demonstrated clinical impact. ABCB1 SNPs are implicated in alteration of plasma drug levels of rivaroxaban and apixaban. Studies conducted with factor Xa, ABCB1, SLCOB1, CYP2C9, and VKORC1 genetic variants did not reveal any significant association with plasma drug levels of edoxaban. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions of dabigatran are mainly mediated by p-glycoprotein. Strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 and p-glycoprotein should be avoided in patients treated with rivaroxaban, apixaban, and edoxaban. We conclude that some of the inter-individual variability of DOACs can be attributed to alteration of genetic variants of gene loci and drug-drug interactions. Future research should be focused on exploring new genetic variants, their effect, and molecular mechanisms that contribute to alteration of plasma levels of DOACs."
30658453,"Recent advances in radiological imaging and genomic analysis are profoundly changing the way to manage lung cancer patients. Screening programs which couple lung cancer risk prediction models and low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) recently showed their effectiveness in the early diagnosis of lung tumors. In addition, the emerging field of radiomics is revolutionizing the approach to handle medical images, i.e., from a ""simple"" visual inspection to a high-throughput analysis of hundreds of quantitative features of images which can predict prognosis and therapy response. Yet, with the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the establishment of large genomic consortia, the whole mutational and transcriptomic profile of lung cancer has been unveiled and made publicly available via web services interfaces. This has tremendously accelerated the discovery of actionable mutations, as well as the identification of cancer biomarkers, which are pivotal for development of personalized targeted therapies. In this review, we will describe recent advances in cancer biomarkers discovery for early diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of chemotherapy response."
30657978,"Werner syndrome (WS) is a cancer-prone disease caused by deficiency of Werner protein (WRN). WRN maintains genome integrity by promoting replication-fork stability after various forms of replication stress. Under mild replication stress, WS cells show impaired ATR-mediated CHK1 activation. However, it remains unclear if WS cells elicit other repair pathway. We demonstrate that loss of WRN leads to enhanced ATM phosphorylation upon prolonged exposure to aphidicolin, a specific inhibitor of DNA polymerases, resulting in CHK1 activation. Moreover, we find that loss of WRN sensitises cells to replication-transcription collisions and promotes accumulation of R-loops, which undergo XPG-dependent cleavage responsible for ATM signalling activation. Importantly, we observe that ATM pathway limits chromosomal instability in WS cells. Finally, we prove that, in WS cells, genomic instability enhanced upon chemical inhibition of ATM kinase activity is counteracted by direct or indirect suppression of R-loop formation or by XPG abrogation. Together, these findings suggest a potential role of WRN as regulator of R-loop-associated genomic instability, strengthening the notion that conflicts between replication and transcription can affect DNA replication, leading to human disease and cancer."
30657954,"Acral melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that affects world populations irrespective of skin color and has worse survival than other cutaneous melanomas. It has relatively few single nucleotide mutations without the UV signature of cutaneous melanomas, but instead has a genetic landscape characterized by structural rearrangements and amplifications. BRAF mutations are less common than in other cutaneous melanomas, and knowledge about alternative therapeutic targets is incomplete."
30657900,"Protein-engineering is a means to optimize protein therapeutics developed for the treatment of so far incurable diseases including cancers and genetic disorders. Here we report on an engineering approach in which we successfully increased the catalytic rate constant of an enzyme that is presently evaluated in enzyme replacement therapies (ERT) of a lysosomal storage disease (LSD). Although ERT is a treatment option for many LSDs, outcomes are lagging far behind expectations for most of them. This has been ascribed to insufficient enzyme activities accumulating in tissues difficult to target such as brain and peripheral nerves. We show for human arylsulfatase A (hARSA) that the activity of a therapeutic enzyme can be substantially increased by reversing activity-diminishing and by inserting activity-promoting amino acid substitutions that had occurred in the evolution of hominids and non-human mammals, respectively. The potential of this approach, here designated as evolutionary redesign, was highlighted by the observation that murinization of only 1 or 3 amino acid positions increased the hARSA activity 3- and 5-fold, respectively, with little impact on stability. The two kinetically optimized hARSA variants showed no immunogenic potential in ERT of a humanized ARSA knockout mouse model of metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) and reduced lysosomal storage of kidney, peripheral and central nervous system up to 3-fold more efficiently than wildtype hARSA. Due to their safety profile and higher therapeutic potential the engineered hARSA variants might represent major advances for future enzyme-based therapies of MLD and stimulate analogous approaches for other enzyme therapeutics."
30657883,"Gastroenteropancreatic Neuroendocrine Neoplasms (GEP-NENs) are heterogeneous regarding site of origin, biological behavior and malignant potential. There has been a rapid increase in data publication over the last 10 years, mainly driven by high-throughput studies on pancreatic and small intestinal NETs. This review summarizes the present knowledge on genetic and epigenetic alterations. We integrated the available information from each compartment to give a pathway-based overview. This provided a summary of the critical alterations sustaining neoplastic cells. It also highlighted similarities and differences across anatomical locations and points that need further investigation. GEP-NENs include well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC). NENs are graded as G1, G2 or G3 based on mitotic count and/or Ki-67 labelling index, NECs are G3 by definition. The distinction between NETs and NECs is also linked to their genetic background, as TP53 and RB1 inactivation in NECs set them apart from NETs. A large number of genetic and epigenetic alterations have been reported. Recurrent changes have been traced back to a reduced number of core pathways including DNA damage repair, cell cycle regulation, PI3K/mTOR signaling. In pancreatic tumors, chromatin remodeling/histone methylation and telomere alteration are also affected. However, also due to the paucity of disease models, further research is necessary to fully integrate and functionalize data on deregulated pathways to recapitulate the large heterogeneity of behaviors displayed by these tumors. This is expected to impact diagnostics, prognostic stratification and planning of personalized therapy."
30657762,"Sanfilippo syndrome type B (Sanfilippo B; Mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIB) occurs due to genetic deficiency of lysosomal alpha-N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU) and subsequent lysosomal accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS), which coincides with devastating neurodegenerative disease. Because NAGLU expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells is not mannose-6-phosphorylated, we developed an insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2)-tagged NAGLU molecule (BMN 250; tralesinidase alfa) that binds avidly to the IGF2 / cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) for glycosylation independent lysosomal targeting. BMN 250 is currently being developed as an investigational enzyme replacement therapy for Sanfilippo B. Here we distinguish two cellular uptake mechanisms by which BMN 250 is targeted to lysosomes. In normal rodent-derived neurons and astrocytes, the majority of BMN250 uptake over 24 hours reaches saturation, which can be competitively inhibited with IGF2, suggestive of CI-MPR-mediated uptake. Kuptake, defined as the concentration of enzyme at half-maximal uptake, is 5 nM and 3 nM in neurons and astrocytes, with a maximal uptake capacity (Vmax) corresponding to 764 nmol/hr/mg and 5380 nmol/hr/mg, respectively. Similar to neurons and astrocytes, BMN 250 uptake in Sanfilippo B patient fibroblasts is predominantly CI-MPR-mediated, resulting in augmentation of NAGLU activity with doses of enzyme that fall well below the Kuptake (5 nM), which are sufficient to prevent HS accumulation. In contrast, uptake of the untagged recombinant human NAGLU (rhNAGLU) enzyme in neurons, astrocytes and fibroblasts is negligible at the same doses tested. In microglia, receptor-independent uptake, defined as enzyme uptake resistant to competition with excess IGF2, results in appreciable lysosomal delivery of BMN 250 and rhNAGLU (Vmax = 12,336 nmol/hr/mg and 5469 nmol/hr/mg, respectively). These results suggest that while receptor-independent mechanisms exist for lysosomal targeting of rhNAGLU in microglia, BMN 250, by its IGF2 tag moiety, confers increased CI-MPR-mediated lysosomal targeting to neurons and astrocytes, two additional critical cell types of Sanfilippo B disease pathogenesis."

30656973,"p53, The tumour suppressor protein encoded by P53 gene, is the most commonly altered protein in the human malignancies. MDM2 controls the p53 activity through an autoregulatory feedback loop. p53 activates the expression of MDM2 and in return, MDM2 blocks the p53 activity through various mechanisms. Nutlins, including nutlin-3, are a new class of small molecules that bind to MDM2 and prevent its interaction with p53. This antagonism results in increased p53 activity and can also re-activates the p53 pathway and resensitize the glioblastoma cells to apoptosis. Here we used nutlin-3 in combination with another potent anticancer drug, doxorubicin, to investigate the synergism between these drugs. We encapsulated both water-insoluble drugs in the PEG-PE-based micellar nanocarriers efficiently and evaluate their efficacy against U87MG cells in 2 D and 3 D models. These nanomedicine formulations successfully re-activated the p53 levels in cells, increased the apoptosis and showed strong synergistic cytotoxic effect."
30656916,"Haemophilia is a bleeding disorder (usually congenital) caused by the deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (haemophilia A) or IX (haemophilia B). The genes encoding factors VIII and IX are located on the X chromosome, so the symptoms of congenital haemophilia A and B occur predominantly in males. Recurring episodes of spontaneous bleeding into joints are the main symptom of haemophilia, which lead to haemophilic artropathy. Historically, patients with haemophilia were treated with whole blood transfusions and then with blood plasma. The first big breakthrough in treatment efficacy was the advent of cryoprecipitate, followed by lyophilized coagulation factor concentrates, derived from plasma. The latter dramatically improved patients' quality of life and allowed for prophylactic self-infusions at home (home treatment). Since the 1990s, the standard treatment has also included recombinant coagulation factor concentrates derived from cell cultures. Today, the main challenges are the need for frequent venipunctures (factor concentrates must be administered intravenously) to maintain successful prophylaxis and emergence of neutralizing antibodies in response to exogenous coagulation factors. Several novel recombinant factors with extended half-life were approved in recent years. Clinical trials of other new technologies are ongoing. These are non-replacement therapies with different mechanisms of action (e.g. emicizumab, a bispecific antibody that mimics the procoagulant activity of factor VIII; fitusiran, siRNA downregulating antithrombin III) and gene therapies using AAV vectors."
30656896,"BRCA1 (breast cancer 1 susceptibility protein) is one of main regulators of cellular genomic stability. It is responsible for proper segregation of chromatides to daughter cells during mitosis as well as DNA double strand breaks repair by homologous recombination (HR). Genetic alterations of BRCA1 gene are cancer predisposition markers. Mutations or epigenetic alterations have been noticed in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers, significantly increasing risk of cancer development. Such gene alterations are not connected with leukemias. Importantly, BRCA1 deficiency is a factor which makes patients susceptible for personalized therapy with PARP1 inhibitors, which is based on the phenomenon called synthetic lethality. In this review we present our discoveries of novel mechanism leading to BRCA1 deficiency in leukemia, which is not connected with BRCA1 gene mutations or epigenetic alterations, but with attenuated translation of BRCA1 protein linked to the cellular stress response and controlled by RNA binding proteins. Moreover, we found that some treatments or genetic alterations in leukemias might also result in BRCA1 deficits. Our studies provide evidence that PARP1 inhibitors should be considered as efficient treatment in BRCA1-deficient leukemias, leading to elimination of cancer cells, including stem and progenitor cells. Finally we propose a strategy to select leukemia patients which might be sensitive to therapy with PARP1 inhibitors."
30656695,"The incidence of postmenopausal osteoporosis research 50% in middle-aged and older women, however, effects of existing therapy are not ideal. Emerging evidence have proved that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) was correlated with multiple physiological and pathology processes including development, carcinogenesis, and osteogenesis. However, reports on lncRNAs regulating bone formation were relatively limited. In this study, we screened osteogenic lncRNAs through mRNA/lncRNA microarray combined with gene coexpression analysis. The biological function of the screened lncRNA was assessed both in vitro and in vivo. The effects of the lncRNA on osteogenic transcription factors were also evaluated. We identified AK016739, which was correlated with osteogenic differentiation and enriched in skeletal tissues of mice. The expression levels of AK016739 in bone-derived mesenchymal stem cells were increased with age and negatively correlated with osteogenic differentiation marker genes. Experiments showed that AK016739 inhibited osteoblast differentiation, and in vivo inhibition of AK016739 by its small interfering RNA would rescue bone formation in ovariectomized osteoporosis mice model. In addition, AK016739 suppressed both expression levels and activities of osteogenic transcription factors. This newly identified lncRNA AK016739 has revealed a new mechanism of osteogenic differentiation and provided new targets for treatment of skeletal disorders."
30656691,"Vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) is a common observed infection, affecting approximately 75% of women of reproductive age. Drug resistance represents a troublesome stumbling block associated with VVC therapy. Thus the aim of the present study was to provide information regarding the selection of potential drug targets for VVC. CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR/CXCR4 double-deficient mouse models of VVC were subsequently established, with changes to the load of Candida Albicans evaluated accordingly. The biological behaviors of the vaginal epithelial cells were characterized in response to the CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout in vivo. Our initial observations revealed that in mice with VVC, CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3 - CXCR4 double-knockout resulted in a decreased load of C. Albicans as well as reduced levels and proportion of Th17 cells. Proinflammatory cytokine production was found to be inhibited by CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout whereby the mRNA and protein expressions CXCR3, CXCR4, IL-17, IL-6, and TNF-α exhibited decreased levels. CXCR3-, CXCR4-, or CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout appeared to function as positive proliferation factors, while playing a negative role in the processes of apoptosis and the cell cycle of vaginal epithelial cells. Taken together, the key findings of the study suggested that CXCR3/CXCR4 double-knockout could act to hinder the progression of VVC, highlighting its promise as a novel therapeutic target in the treatment of VVC. CXCR3 and CXCR4 genes may regulate Th17/IL-17 immune inflammatory pathways to participate in antifungal immunity."
30656632,"Lentiviral vectors are increasingly used as efficient gene transfer tools in the experimental and clinical gene therapy treatment of acquired and inherited genetic diseases. Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are characterized by the capacity for self-renewal, as well as multi-lineage differentiation and maintenance of the lymphohematopoietic system throughout life. As such, HSC transplantation (HSCT) has proven to be a powerful therapeutic modality for the treatment of both malignant and nonmalignant disorders. Transduction of lentiviral vectors into HSCs may offer long-term stable expression of a therapeutic gene in both preclinical and clinical settings. The purpose of this chapter is to describe an optimized procedure for lentiviral transduction of mouse HSCs followed by HSCT."

30655991,"The prognosis of childhood cancers has improved markedly, and the proportion of long-term survivors has increased in recent years. However, with the increase in the number of long-term survivors, the development of latent treatment-related adverse effects, such as secondary malignancies, has generated new problems. Secondary cancer is defined as a histologically distinct malignancy that develops at least 2 months after the completion of treatment for primary cancer. Genetic factors and acquired conditions associated with treatment modalities are possible causes of secondary malignancy development. Genetic factors include the presence of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) and retinoblastoma. In terms of acquired factors, radiation and chemotherapy have been reported to be the most strongly associated with secondary malignancy development. The use of alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors for the treatment of childhood cancer increases the subsequent risk of secondary tumors. We herein investigated three cases of secondary osteosarcoma several years after treatment for primary cancer. In the three patients, the familial history did not appear to fit the clinical diagnostic criteria of LFS or retinoblastoma. The patients had not received previous radiation therapy to the anatomical site of the secondary cancer. However, high dosages of alkylating agents and topoisomerase II inhibitors had been administered for the treatment of primary cancer. The exact link between chemotherapy and secondary cancer remains elusive, but the possibility of an association should be considered. Following the development of multidisciplinary therapies, long-term follow-up and monitoring of latent adverse effects may be necessary for childhood cancer survivors."
30655972,"Paraganglioma and pheochromocytoma are rare neuroendocrine neoplasms that originate from chromaffin cells. In many of these tumors, several mutations are reported to occur in the genes of germline and/or somatic cells. A case of paraganglioma in the posterior mediastinum with highly malignant potential is reported. The patient had a rapid clinical course, and it was difficult to reach the final diagnosis. The initial diagnosis on fine-needle aspiration biopsy was a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) arising from the esophagus. Although radiation therapy was effective for the main tumor, the lung metastases did not respond sufficiently to several tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Autopsy and immunohistochemical examination using a battery of different markers resulted in a final diagnosis of malignant paraganglioma. Next-generation sequencing revealed several gene mutations and copy number variations, including of fumarate hydratase (<i>FH</i>), <i>neurofibromatosis type-1</i> (<i>NF1</i>) and <i>RET</i>. Those gene alterations may contribute to the pathogenesis of this malignant phenotype to a certain extent. To confirm this, further cases and studies are required. In addition, it should be noted that histological examination of a small piece of tumor might have sampling bias and could cause misdiagnosis."
30655903,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is a major type of human lung cancer and the primary cause of cancer-associated cases of mortality worldwide. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (<i>PTEN</i>) is a potent tumor suppressor gene in various human cancer types. The aim of the current study was to explore the role of PTEN and its associated regulatory mechanisms in NSCLC. Firstly, the expression of PTEN was detected using western blotting in a variety of NSCLC cell lines. The results revealed that compared with normal control cells, PTEN levels were significantly decreased in NSCLC cell lines (P<0.01). Short hairpin (sh)RNAs specific to PTEN were also used to knockdown endogenous PTEN in NSCLC cells. The results indicated that cell viability was significantly increased in PTEN-knockdown cells compared with those transfected with negative control shRNA (P<0.01). Conversely, overexpression of PTEN in A549 and SK-MES-1 cells significantly decreased the optical density of NSCLC cells (P<0.01). Flow cytometry was used to investigate the cell cycle; the results revealed that PTEN knockdown significantly increased the percentage of cells at G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase (P<0.01) and decreased the number of cells at S phase (P<0.01). The molecular mechanism was further explored using western blotting and the results demonstrated that PTEN overexpression increased the levels of cleaved caspase-3 (P<0.01). These results suggest that PTEN may be a potential target gene for gene therapy in patients with NSCLCs."
30655894,"Traditional Chinese medicine applied to cancer therapy has a long history. This study aimed to investigate the effect and underlying mechanism of the traditional Chinese medicine, Yuxiao San, in combination with cisplatin, on Lewis lung cancer mice. Lewis lung cancer mouse models were were established in mice, and were randomly divided into model (normal saline + egg white), cisplatin (cisplatin injection + egg white), traditional Chinese medicine (Yuxiao San + egg white) and combined medication (Yuxiao San + cisplatin injection + egg white) groups. The weight and tumor size of mice was measured every 3 days, and the number of lung surface metastasis nodules were calculated after 14 days. Nucleoside diphosphate kinase (nm-23) and K-ras expression levels in tumor tissues were determined by immunohistochemical methods and reverse transcription- quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results suggested that compared with the model group, cisplatin, traditional Chinese medicine and combined medication groups significantly inhibited growth of transplanted tumors, reduced the number of lung metastasis nodules, increased the inhibition rate of lung metastasis (P<0.05 or P<0.01), significantly increased tumor suppressor gene nm-23 expression and significantly downregulated oncogene K-ras expression. Among all groups, the effect of the combined medication group for inhibiting tumor growth was most favorable (P<0.01). Compared with the cisplatin group, nm-23 expression in the traditional Chinese medicine group and the combined medication group was significantly increased, and K-ras expression in the traditional Chinese medicine and combined medication groups was significantly reduced (P<0.01). To conclude, Yuxiao San and cisplatin injection effectively inhibited growth of the transplanted tumor. The underlying mechanism may be associate with nm-23 upregulation and K-ras downregulation. Therefore, the Yuxiao San and cisplatin injection may become a potential therapeutic strategy for tumor treatment."
30655893,"The PRL-3 gene is involved in the liver metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC) and oncogene addiction to anticancer therapy. In the present study genomic gains in PRL-3 and its pathway genes, c-myc and EGFR, were investigated in order to determine their clinical relevance during metastatic formation in primary CRC and corresponding liver metastases. The genomic gain statuses of PRL-3, EGFR, and c-myc were investigated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis in 35 samples of CRC and corresponding liver metastases. In the primary CRC specimens, genomic gains in PRL-3, c-myc, and EGFR were observed in 4, 4, and 13 cases, respectively. A genomic gain in one gene was observed in 18 cases, and these genomic gains were mutually exclusive. In the liver metastasis specimens, genomic gains were observed in 14, 8, and 13 cases, respectively. The copy numbers of PRL-3 and c-myc were significantly higher in the liver metastases than in the primary CRC specimens (P=0.03, P=0.009, respectively). A genomic gain in PRL-3 was the most frequent gain in the liver metastases (P=0.004) and was partially redundant with a c-myc genomic gain. EGFR genomic gains were consistent between the primary CRC and the liver metastases (P=0.0000008). In addition, a genomic gain in any of the 3 genes was observed in 23 cases (66%). Among the clinicopathological factors that were assessed, an EGFR genomic gain was significantly associated with tumour size in the primary CRC and the liver metastases (P=0.04). A c-myc genomic gain was also significantly associated with the v factor of the primary tumours in the liver metastases (P<0.01). In conclusion, the genomic copy numbers of PRL-3, c-myc and EGFR were frequently characterised by aberrations in genomic gain in liver metastases from CRC; thus, these gene statuses exhibit potential for the identification of patients who are likely to respond positively to anticancer therapies."
30655863,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of malignant brain tumor, and is associated with poor patient prognosis. A comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying GBM may help to guide the identification of novel diagnoses and treatment targets. The gene expression profile of the GSE4290 GBM dataset was analyzed in order to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Enriched pathways were identified through Gene Ontology and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed in order to identify hub genes and for module analysis. Expression and survival analyses were conducted in order to screen and validate critical genes. A total of 1,801 DEGs were recorded, including 620 upregulated and 1,181 downregulated genes. Upregulated DEGs were enriched in the terms 'mitotic cell cycle process', 'mitotic cell cycle' and 'cell cycle process'. Downregulated genes were enriched in 'transsynaptic signaling', 'anterograde transsynaptic signaling' and 'synaptic signaling'. A total of 15 hub genes, which displayed a high degree of connectivity, were selected. These genes included vascular endothelial growth factor A, cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (CDK1), cell-division cycle protein 20 (CDC20), aurora kinase A (AURKA), and budding uninhibited by benzimidazoles 1 (BUB1). The identified DEGs and hub genes may help guide investigations on the mechanisms underlying the development and progression of GBM. CDK1, CDC20, AURKA and BUB1, which are involved in cell cycle pathways, may be potential targets in the diagnosis and therapy of GBM."
30655848,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is defined by a lack of ER, PgR, and HER2 expression, and to date there have been no significant advances in treatment by targeted therapies against those molecules. Therefore, primary systemic therapy (PST) followed by surgery is the standard therapy for patients with advanced TNBC. According to gene expression analysis, TNBC has a distinct profile when compared with non-TNBC, suggesting that a unique gene affects the treatment efficacy of PST. Cell adhesion molecule (CADM) genes encode an immunoglobulin superfamily molecule involved in cell-to-cell adhesion in a variety of human epithelial cells. While it has been reported that inactivation of CADM1 and CADM4 serves a pivotal role in the progression of breast cancer, a full analysis has not been completed for TNBC. Previous studies have reported that CADM1 and CADM4 expression is less likely to be decreased in TNBC than in non-TNBC. In the present study, CADM1 and CADM4 expression was evaluated in patients with TNBC who had received PST. The present study revealed that loss or weak expression of CADM1 was frequently observed in non-pathological complete response patients. Furthermore, while the majority of TNBC cases exhibited high CADM1 expression, a small number of cases exhibited low CADM1 expression and low therapeutic response of PST for TNBC. These results suggest that CADM1 has a pivotal role in anti-PST efficacy in patients with TNBC."
30655810,"In the present study, the functions and mechanisms of rotundic acid (RA) underlying its induction of apoptosis in caspase-3-transfected MCF-7 human breast cancer cells (Cas3-MCF-7 cells) were investigated. RA induced apoptosis in Cas3-MCF-7 cells more efficiently compared with that in MCF-7 cells transfected with control plasmid. The results from an MTT assay demonstrated that RA effectively inhibited Cas3-MCF-7 cell viability in a dose-dependent manner and induced cell apoptosis via caspase-3 activity within 12 to 48 h. Western blotting and fluorescence-activated cell sorting demonstrated that RA initiated Cas3-MCF-7 cell apoptosis via p53 activation. The silencing of the p53 gene in the Cas3-MCF-7 cell line led to decreased RA-induced Cas3-MCF-7 cell caspase-3 activity and cell apoptosis. Collectively, the results of the present study indicate that caspase-3 serves a critical function in rotundic acid-induced apoptosis, and suggest that caspase-3 deficiency may contribute to the chemotherapy-resistance of breast cancer. Reconstitution of caspase-3 sensitizes MCF-7 breast cancer cells to chemotherapy. RA has the potential for development as a novel drug combined with reconstitution of caspase-3 gene therapy for the treatment of human breast cancer with caspase-3 deficiency."
30655808,"Gene profiling has identified at least 4 breast cancer subtypes, including Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched and basal-like, and immunohistochemistry is used as a guide to determine these subtypes. In the present study, patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative and negative nodes were classified into 4 groups according to the PgR and the Ki-67 status and were retrospectively examined. The analysis was based on the clinicopathological findings, and includes the recurrence score (RS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates. Patients with invasive breast cancer (n=1866) were classified as LA (high PgR/low Ki-67), LB-1 (high PgR/high Ki-67), LB-2 (low PgR/high Ki-67), and LB-3 (low PgR/low Ki-67). In addition, 41 of the cases underwent a 21-gene expression assay. The data revealed that T1 tumors were more prevalent in the LA group and rare in the LB-2 group. Furthermore, nuclear grade 3 and p53 overexpression was revealed to be significantly correlated with LB-2. In terms of prognosis, LA had a significantly more favorable DFS; however, no differences were observed in the LB-3 group. LB-2 had a significantly worse DFS in all cases, and in the cases administered with endocrine therapy alone. Chemotherapy in combination with endocrine therapy was administered to cases with a higher risk of recurrence. In the LB-2 group, there was no difference in the DFS rates between the cases with endocrine therapy and chemo-endocrine therapy. These findings suggest that chemotherapy could improve the DFS in the LB-2 group. In addition, the majority of cases with LA, LB-3 and LB-1 had a RS of ≤25 and the majority of the LB-2 cases had a RS of >25. The patients with LA and LB-3 had a favorable DFS even in the group that received endocrine therapy alone. LB-2 was significantly correlated with a higher degree of malignancy and benefited from chemotherapy. These data suggest that the PgR and the Ki-67 status are effective in predicting prognosis, and for deciding on the most effective treatment strategy in patients with breast cancer."
30655785,"Previous studies have suggested that cancer stem cells serve crucial functions in tumorigenesis, metastasis and therapy failure. Stem cell signaling transduction pathways are frequently dysregulated in cancer and associated with tumorigenesis, metastasis and the cell cycle, which are necessary for cancer proliferation. However, cancer stem cell-associated gene signatures have not been established for predicting patient outcomes in colorectal cancer. Using a gene-mining approach, the present study performed mRNA expression profiling in large colorectal cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, including a TCGA colorectal cancer cohort (n=383) and three independent validation series GSE39582 (n=582), GSE17536 (n=177) and GSE17537 (n=55). The present study identified that an eight-gene signature in cancer stem cell signaling was associated with the overall survival and disease/recurrence-free survival of patients with colorectal. On the basis of this signature, patients in the TCGA training sets were divided into high-risk and low-risk subgroups with a significantly different overall survival rate (hazard ratio, 2.38; P=0.0005). The prognostic value of this signature was confirmed using three independent GEO colorectal cancer sets. Identifying this prognostic stem cell signaling signature may provide an efficient classification tool for clinical prognosis evaluation, and facilitate cancer stem cell-targeted therapy."
30655773,"This study investigated the inhibitory effects of <i>miR-124</i> and <i>miR-152</i> on the growth of human ovarian cancer (OC) SKOV3 cell line subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice. Twenty-eight healthy nude mice were selected and divided into the experimental group 1 (n=4), experimental group 2 (n=4), negative control group 1 (n=4), negative control group 2 (n=4), blank control group 1 (n=4), blank control group 2 (n=4) and observation group (n=4) according to the principle of similarity in body weight. The transfected SKOV3 cells were inoculated subcutaneously into the nape of the nude mice. After tumorigenesis, <i>miR-124</i> mimics, <i>miR-152</i> mimics, and their negative controls were transiently transfected into human OC SKOV3 cells via lipofection method. The expression levels of <i>miR-124</i> and <i>miR-152</i> were detected via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and those of Ki-67 and caspase-3 were detected by western blotting. After transfection, the expression levels of <i>miR-124</i> and <i>miR-152</i> in the SKOV3 cells were significantly upregulated. The nude mice were sacrificed 36 days later, and tumor nodes of nude mice transfected with <i>miR-124</i> and <i>miR-152</i> grew slowly. Compared with that in the experimental groups, tumor size in the blank control and negative control groups was gradually increased with the increment of days (P<0.05). The volume of subcutaneous xenografts in nude mice of <i>miR-124</i> and <i>miR-152</i> experimental groups was obviously smaller than that in the blank control and negative control groups (P<0.05). Besides, the inhibition of tumor size in the observation group was more significant than that in the experimental groups (P<0.05). Thus, <i>miR-124</i> and <i>miR-152</i> inhibit the growth of human epithelial OC xenografts in nude mice, and they are expected to become new targets for gene-based therapy of OC."
30655772,"Accumulating evidence indicates that the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab significantly improves the clinical prognosis of patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. However, a number of patients relapse or fail to respond to rituximab. To further understand the cause of this, polymorphisms of FcγRIIIa were initially detected in healthy volunteers. Subsequently, the rituximab-dependent natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity of different FcγRIIIa genotypes was assessed by a cytotoxicity assay <i>in vitro</i>. Ultimately, the effect of human serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G and complement on rituximab-dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity was evaluated <i>in vitro</i>. It was revealed that FcγRIIIa polymorphisms were associated with the antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of NK cells. In addition, the ADCC of NK cells with FcγRIIIa-158 V/V was increased compared with that of FcγRIIIa-158 V/F. The serum IgG and rituximab Fc segment was able to bind competitively with NK cell FcγRIIIa. It was observed that serum IgG inhibited, whereas complement enhanced rituximab-induced NK-cell mediated ADCC. Therefore, various agents administered synchronously with rituximab may modulate the efficacy of this agent and ultimately its toxicity against tumor cells."
30655744,"Long noncoding RNA FOXF1 adjacent non-coding developmental regulatory RNA (FENDRR) dysregulation associates with multiple types of human cancer. However, the biological functions of FENDRR in renal cell carcinoma are unresolved. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine the expression level of FENDRR in renal cell carcinoma tissues. An RNA interference assay and ectopic expression experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of FENDRR on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and colony formation <i>in vitro</i>. RNA immunoprecipitation was conducted to identify proteins associated with FENDRR. It was observed that FENDRR is frequently downregulated in renal cell carcinoma and overexpression of FENDRR attenuated proliferation, migration, invasion and colony growth of renal carcinoma cells. Conversely, knockdown of FENDRR promotes proliferation and invasiveness of renal carcinoma cells. Downregulation of FENDRR associates with poor prognosis of renal cell carcinoma. Mechanistically, it was identified that FENDRR may bind to Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 and lysin methyltransferase 2A histone modifying complexes. In summary, FENDRR acts as an tumor suppressor in renal cell carcinoma and may serve as a candidate target for gene therapy."
30655732,"Patient-derived xenograft (PDX) mouse models involve the direct transfer of fresh human tumor samples into immunodeficient mice following surgical resection or other medical operations. Gene expression in tumors may be maintained by serial passages of tumors from mouse to mouse. These models aid research into tumor biology and pharmacology without manual manipulation of cell cultures <i>in vitro</i>. and are widely used in individualized cancer therapy/translational medicine, drug development and coclinical trials. PDX models exhibit higher predictive values for clinical outcomes than cell line-derived xenograft models and genetically engineered mouse models. However, PDX models are associated with certain challenges in clinical application. The present study reviewed current collections of PDX models and assessed the challenges and future directions of this field."
30655613,"One of the most severe complications after successful cancer therapy is the development of therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN). Constitutional genetic variation is likely to impact on t-MN risk. We aimed to evaluate if polymorphisms in the p53 pathway can be useful for predicting t-MN susceptibility. First, an association study revealed that the Pro variant of the TP53 Arg72Pro polymorphism and the G allele of the MDM2 SNP309 were associated with t-MN risk. The Arg variant of TP53 is more efficient at inducing apoptosis, whereas the Pro variant is a more potent inductor of cell cycle arrest and DNA repair. As regards MDM2 SNP309, the G allele is associated with attenuation of the p53 apoptotic response. Second, to evaluate the biological effect of the TP53 polymorphism, we established Jurkat isogenic cell lines expressing p53Arg or p53Pro. Jurkat p53Arg cells presented higher DNA damage and higher apoptotic potential than p53Pro cells, after treatment with chemotherapy agents. Only p53Pro cells presented t(15;17) translocation and del(5q). We suggest that failure to repair DNA lesions in p53Arg cells would lead them to apoptosis, whereas some p53Pro cells, prone to cell cycle arrest and DNA repair, could undergo misrepair, generating chromosomal abnormalities typical of t-MN."
30655605,"Although head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has in the past been largely associated with tobacco use, human papillomavirus (HPV+) oropharynx cancer has in recent years emerged as the fastest growing type of HNSCC. Patients with HPV+ HNSCC have a better prognosis; however, the 5-year survival for both HPV+ and HPV- subtypes with recurrent or metastatic disease is poor. To gain insights into the tumor microenvironments of both HNSCC subtypes and identify potential therapeutic targets, we performed epigenomic deconvolution on 580 HNSCC samples from the TCGA dataset. Deconvolution revealed distinct molecular and histoepigenetic profiles of the two tumor subtypes, including their cellular composition, epigenomic profiles and gene expression for constituent cell types, and potential cancer cell-specific targets. Our analyses show that high abundance of both CD8 T-cells and B-cells explains better prognosis in HPV+ HNSCC. Deconvolution of gene expression profiles revealed higher expression of the immunotherapy target PD-1 in HPV+ immune cells compared to HPV- cells, suggesting that HPV+ tumors may preferentially benefit from PD-1 targeted therapy. Further analyses identified HPV+ and HPV- cancer cell surface proteins that can also serve as potential targets for therapy. Specifically, Wnt pathway receptor ROR2 is preferentially overexpressed in HPV+ subtypes, suggesting opportunities for development of targeted therapy based on HPV status. In summary, the comprehensive molecular and histoepigenetic analysis of tumor microenvironments by epigenomic deconvolution reveals potential novel biomarkers and targets for precision therapy of HNSCC."
30655510,"Mutations in exon 9 of the calreticulin gene (CALR) frequently occur in patients with chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN). Patients exhibit spontaneous cellular immune responses to epitopes derived from the mutant CALR C-terminus, and CALR-mutant-specific T cells recognize autologous CALR-mutant malignant cells. This study investigated whether CALR-mutant-specific T cells occur naturally in CALRwt MPN-patients and in healthy individuals. Specific immune responses against epitopes in the mutant CALR peptide sequence were detected in both CALRwt MPN-patients and in healthy individuals. Healthy donors displayed more frequent and stronger CALR-mutant specific T-cell responses compared to the responses identified in CALR-mutant MPN-patients. Several T-cell responses were identified in healthy donors directly ex vivo. Importantly, by running functional analyses on live-sorted immune cells from healthy donors, we showed that circulating CALR-mutant-specific immune cells are T-memory cells. These findings suggest, that healthy individuals acquire a CALR exon 9 mutation, but the immune system reacts and clears the mutant cells, and during this reaction generates CALR-mutant specific T-memory cells. We believe that these findings provide the evidence for tumor immune surveillance in MPN."
30655508,"Anxiety disorders are among the leading health issues in human medicine. The complex phenotypic and allelic nature of these traits as well as the challenge of establishing reliable measures of the heritable component of behaviour from the associated environmental factors hampers progress in their molecular aetiology. Dogs exhibit large natural variation in fearful and anxious behaviour and could facilitate progress in the molecular aetiology due to their unique genetic architecture. We have performed a genome-wide association study with a canine high-density SNP array in a cohort of 330 German Shepherds for two phenotypes, fear of loud noises (noise sensitivity) and fear of strangers or in novel situations. Genome-widely significant loci were discovered for the traits on chromosomes 20 and 7, respectively. The regions overlap human neuropsychiatric loci, including 18p11.2, with physiologically relevant candidate genes that contribute to glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in the brain. In addition, the noise-sensitivity locus includes hearing-related candidate genes. These results indicate a genetic contribution for canine fear and suggest a shared molecular aetiology of anxiety across species. Further characterisation of the identified loci will pave the way to molecular understanding of the conditions as a prerequisite for improved therapy."
30655352,"Glaucoma is characterized by a progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the eye, which ultimately results in visual impairment or even blindness. As current therapies often fail to halt disease progression, there is an unmet need for novel neuroprotective therapies to support RGC survival. Various research lines suggest that visual target centers in the brain support RGC functioning and survival. We explored whether increasing neuronal activity in one of these projection areas could improve survival of RGCs in a mouse glaucoma model. Prolonged activation of an important murine RGC target area, the superior colliculus (SC), was established via a novel optogenetic stimulation paradigm. By leveraging the unique channel kinetics of the stabilized step function opsin (SSFO), protracted stimulation of the SC was achieved with only a brief light pulse. SSFO-mediated collicular stimulation was confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the immediate-early gene c-Fos and behavioral tracking, which both demonstrated consistent neuronal activity upon repeated stimulation. Finally, the neuroprotective potential of optogenetic collicular stimulation was investigated in mice of either sex subjected to a glaucoma model, and a 63% reduction in RGC loss was found. Together, this work describes a new paradigm for optogenetic collicular stimulation and a first demonstration that increasing target neuron activity can increase survival of the projecting neurons.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b>Despite glaucoma being a leading cause of blindness and visual impairment worldwide, no curative therapies exist. This study describes a novel paradigm to reduce retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration underlying glaucoma. Building on previous observations that RGC survival is supported by the target neurons to which they project, and employing an innovative optogenetic approach, we increased neuronal activity in the mouse superior colliculus, <i>i.e.</i> a main projection target of rodent RGCs. This proved to be efficient in reducing RGC loss in a glaucoma model. Our findings establish a new optogenetic paradigm for target stimulation and encourage further exploration of the molecular signaling pathways mediating retrograde neuroprotective communication."

30655164,"Immunotherapy constitutes an exciting and rapidly evolving field, and the demonstration that genetically modified T-cell receptors (TCRs) can be used to produce T-lymphocyte populations of desired specificity offers new opportunities for antigen-specific T-cell therapy. Overall, TCR-modified T cells have the ability to target a wide variety of self and non-self targets through the normal biology of a T cell. Although major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted and dependent on co-receptors, genetically engineered TCRs still present a number of characteristics that ensure they are an important alternative strategy to chimeric antigen receptors (CARs), and high-affinity TCRs can now be successfully engineered with the potential to enhance therapeutic efficacy while minimizing adverse events. This review will focus on the main characteristics of TCR gene-modified cells, their potential clinical application and promise to the field of adoptive cell transfer (ACT), basic manufacturing procedures and characterization protocols and overall challenges that need to be overcome so that redirection of TCR specificity may be successfully translated into clinical practice, beyond early-phase clinical trials."

30654767,Age-related genetic changes in lymphocyte subsets are not currently well documented. BACH2 is a transcription factor that plays an important role in immune-mediated homeostasis by tightly regulating PRDM1 expression in both B-cells and T-cells. BACH2 gene expression is highly sensitive to DNA damage in aged mice. This concept led us to investigate the variation in BACH2 and also PRDM1 expression in major lymphocyte subsets with age.
30654760,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute febrile childhood systemic vasculitis that disturbs coronary arteries. The pathogenesis remains unknown.

30654536,"Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumor. Even with aggressive treatment including surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy, patient outcomes remain poor, with five-year survival rates at only 10%. Barriers to treatment include inefficient drug delivery across the blood brain barrier and development of drug resistance. Because gliomas occur due to sequential acquisition of genetic alterations, gene therapy represents a promising alternative to overcome limitations of conventional therapy. Gene or nucleic acid carriers must be used to deliver these therapies successfully into tumor tissue and have been extensively studied. Viral vectors have been evaluated in clinical trials for glioblastoma gene therapy but have not achieved FDA approval due to issues with viral delivery, inefficient tumor penetration, and limited efficacy. Non-viral vectors have been explored for delivery of glioma gene therapy and have shown promise as gene vectors for glioma treatment in preclinical studies and a few non-polymeric vectors have entered clinical trials. In this review, delivery systems including viral, non-polymeric, and polymeric vectors that have been used in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) gene therapy are discussed. Additionally, advances in glioblastoma gene therapy using viral and non-polymeric vectors in clinical trials and emerging polymeric vectors for glioma gene therapy are discussed."
30654523,"Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including coronary artery disease (CAD) and ischemic heart disease (IHD) are the main cause of mortality in industrialized countries. Although it is well known that there is a difference in the risk of these diseases in women and men, current therapy does not consider the sexual dimorphism; i.e., differences in anatomical structures and metabolism of tissues. Here, we discuss how genetic, epigenetic, hormonal, cellular or molecular factors may explain the different CVD risk, especially in high-risk groups such as women with diabetes. We analyze whether sex may modify the effects of diabetes at risk of CAD. Finally, we discuss current diagnostic techniques in the evaluation of CAD and IHD in diabetic women."
30654522,"Checkpoint inhibitor therapy has introduced a revolution in contemporary anticancer therapy. It has led to dramatic improvements in patient outcomes and has spawned tremendous research into novel immunomodulatory agents and combination therapy that has changed the trajectory of cancer care. However, clinical benefit in patients with colorectal cancer has been generally limited to tumors with loss of mismatch repair function and those with specific germline mutations in the DNA polymerase gene. Unfortunately, tumors with these specific mutator phenotypes are in the minority. Recent pre-clinical and clinical studies have begun to reveal encouraging results suggesting that checkpoint inhibitor therapy can be expanded to an increasing number of colorectal tumors with microsatellite stability and the absence of traditional predictive biomarkers of checkpoint inhibitor response. These studies generally rely on combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy, molecular targeted therapy, radiation therapy, or other novel immunomodulatory agents. This article will review the most current data in microsatellite stable colorectal cancer."
30654448,"Sepsis is characterized by dysregulated gene expression, provoking a hyper-inflammatory response occurring in parallel to a hypo-inflammatory reaction. This is often associated with multi-organ failure, leading to the patient's death. Therefore, reprogramming of these pro- and anti-inflammatory, as well as immune-response genes which are involved in acute systemic inflammation, is a therapy approach to prevent organ failure and to improve sepsis outcomes. Considering epigenetic, i.e., reversible, modifications of chromatin, not altering the DNA sequence as one tool to adapt the expression profile, inhibition of factors mediating these changes is important. Acetylation of histones by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and initiating an open-chromatin structure leading to its active transcription is counteracted by histone deacetylases (HDACs). Histone deacetylation triggers a compact nucleosome structure preventing active transcription. Hence, inhibiting the activity of HDACs by specific inhibitors can be used to restore the expression profile of the cells. It can be assumed that HDAC inhibitors will reduce the expression of pro-, as well as anti-inflammatory mediators, which blocks sepsis progression. However, decreased cytokine expression might also be unfavorable, because it can be associated with decreased bacterial clearance."
30654437,"Tissue engineering and cell-based therapy combine techniques that create biocompatible materials for cell survival, which can improve tendon repair. This study seeks to use a new fibrin sealant (FS) derived from the venom of <i>Crotalus durissus terrificus</i>, a biodegradable three-dimensional scaffolding produced from animal components only, associated with adipose-derived stem cells (ASC) for application in tendons injuries, considered a common and serious orthopedic problem. Lewis rats had tendons distributed in five groups: normal (N), transected (T), transected and FS (FS) or ASC (ASC) or with FS and ASC (FS + ASC). The in vivo imaging showed higher quantification of transplanted PKH26-labeled ASC in tendons of FS + ASC compared to ASC on the 14th day after transection. A small number of Iba1 labeled macrophages carrying PKH26 signal, probably due to phagocytosis of dead ASC, were observed in tendons of transected groups. ASC up-regulated the <i>Tenomodulin</i> gene expression in the transection region when compared to N, T and FS groups and the expression of <i>TIMP-2</i> and <i>Scleraxis</i> genes in relation to the N group. FS group presented a greater organization of collagen fibers, followed by FS + ASC and ASC in comparison to N. Tendons from ASC group presented higher hydroxyproline concentration in relation to N and the transected tendons of T, FS and FS + ASC had a higher amount of collagen I and tenomodulin in comparison to N group. Although no marked differences were observed in the other biomechanical parameters, T group had higher value of maximum load compared to the groups ASC and FS + ASC. In conclusion, the FS kept constant the number of transplanted ASC in the transected region until the 14th day after injury. Our data suggest this FS to be a good scaffold for treatment during tendon repair because it was the most effective one regarding tendon organization recovering, followed by the FS treatment associated with ASC and finally by the transplanted ASC on the 21st day. Further investigations in long-term time points of the tendon repair are needed to analyze if the higher tissue organization found with the FS scaffold will improve the biomechanics of the tendons."
30654191,"KRAS is one of the most frequently mutated proto-oncogenes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and aberrantly activated in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). A profound role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in the pathogenesis of human cancer is being uncovered, including in cancer therapy. Using in silico prediction algorithms, we identified miR-873 as a potential regulator of KRAS, and we investigated its role in PDAC and TNBC. We found that reduced miR-873 expression is associated with shorter patient survival in both cancers. miR-873 expression is significantly repressed in PDAC and TNBC cell lines and inversely correlated with KRAS levels. We demonstrate that miR-873 directly bound to the 3' UTR of KRAS mRNA and suppressed its expression. Notably, restoring miR-873 expression induced apoptosis; recapitulated the effects of KRAS inhibition on cell proliferation, colony formation, and invasion; and suppressed the activity of ERK and PI3K/AKT, while overexpression of KRAS rescued the effects mediated by miR-873. Moreover, in vivo delivery of miR-873 nanoparticles inhibited KRAS expression and tumor growth in PDAC and TNBC tumor models. In conclusion, we provide the first evidence that miR-873 acts as a tumor suppressor by targeting KRAS and that miR-873-based gene therapy may be a therapeutic strategy in PDAC and TNBC."
30654134,"- Atrial fibrillation (AF) is sustained by reentrant mechanisms that depend, in part, on atrial structural remodeling. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) activity occurs in persistent AF. A general consensus has been that electrophysiological actions of CaMKII must be the contributing factor, but electrical remodeling in AF differs considerably with electrophysiological effects of CaMKII. CaMKII has been associated with structural remodeling in several tissues, but not the cardiac atria. The role of CaMKII in sustaining AF remains undefined."
30654105,"Active vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) has been shown to regulate numerous cell processes in mammary cells. Degradation of 1,25(OH)2D is initiated by the mitochondrial enzyme, 25-hydroxyvitamin D 24-hydroxylase (CYP24 A1), and provides local control of 1,25(OH)2D bioactivity. Several reports of the association between elevated CYP24 A1 activity and breast cancer incidence, suggest that CYP24 A1 may be a target for therapeutic intervention. Whether CYP24 A1 activity within the mammary epithelium regulates 1,25(OH)2D levels and mammary gland development is yet to shown. We have used a conditional knockout of the Cyp24a1 gene specifically in the mammary epithelium to demonstrate reduced terminal end bud number, ductal outgrowth and branching during puberty and alveologenesis at early pregnancy, by inhibiting proliferation but not apoptosis in both basal and luminal MECs. In vitro study showed increased sensitivity of luminal MECs to lower levels of 1,25(OH)2D with the ablation of Cyp24a1 activity. In summary, Cyp24a1 within MECs plays an important role in modulating postnatal and pregnancy-associated mammary gland development which provides support for inhibiting CYP24 A1 as a potential approach to activating the vitamin D pathway in breast cancer prevention and therapy."

30653853,"Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental syndrome diagnosed primarily by persistent deficits in social interactions and communication, unusual sensory reactivity, motor stereotypies, repetitive behaviors, and restricted interests. No FDA-approved medical treatments exist for the diagnostic symptoms of autism. Here we interrogate multiple pharmacological targets in two distinct mouse models that incorporate well-replicated autism-relevant behavioral phenotypes. Compounds that modify inhibitory or excitatory neurotransmission were selected to address hypotheses based on previously published biological abnormalities in each model. Shank3B is a genetic model of a mutation found in autism and Phelan-McDermid syndrome, in which deficits in excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity have been reported. BTBR is an inbred strain model of forms of idiopathic autism in which reduced inhibitory neurotransmission and excessive mTOR signaling have been reported. The GABA-A receptor agonist gaboxadol significantly reduced repetitive self-grooming in three independent cohorts of BTBR. The TrkB receptor agonist 7,8-DHF improved spatial learning in Shank3B mice, and reversed aspects of social deficits in BTBR. CX546, a positive allosteric modulator of the glutamatergic AMPA receptor, and d-cycloserine, a partial agonist of the glycine site on the glutamatergic NMDA receptor, did not rescue aberrant behaviors in Shank3B mice. The mTOR inhibitor rapamycin did not ameliorate social deficits or repetitive behavior in BTBR mice. Comparison of positive and negative pharmacological outcomes, on multiple phenotypes, evaluated for replicability across independent cohorts, enhances the translational value of mouse models of autism for therapeutic discovery. GABA agonists present opportunities for personalized interventions to treat components of autism spectrum disorder. Autism Res 2019. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Many of the risk genes for autism impair synapses, the connections between nerve cells in the brain. A drug that reverses the synaptic effects of a mutation could offer a precision therapy. Combining pharmacological and behavioral therapies could reduce symptoms and improve the quality of life for people with autism. Here we report reductions in repetitive behavior by a GABA-A receptor agonist, gaboxadol, and improvements in social and cognitive behaviors by a TrkB receptor agonist, in mouse models of autism."
30653565,"During erythropoiesis, haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) differentiate in successive steps of commitment and specification to mature erythrocytes. This differentiation process is controlled by transcription factors that establish stage- and cell type-specific gene expression. In this study, we demonstrate that FUSE binding protein 1 (FUBP1), a transcriptional regulator important for HSC self-renewal and survival, is regulated by T-cell acute lymphocytic leukaemia 1 (TAL1) in erythroid progenitor cells. TAL1 directly activates the FUBP1 promoter, leading to increased FUBP1 expression during erythroid differentiation. The binding of TAL1 to the FUBP1 promoter is highly dependent on an intact GATA sequence in a combined E-box/GATA motif. We found that FUBP1 expression is required for efficient erythropoiesis, as FUBP1-deficient progenitor cells were limited in their potential of erythroid differentiation. Thus, the finding of an interconnection between GATA1/TAL1 and FUBP1 reveals a molecular mechanism that is part of the switch from progenitor- to erythrocyte-specific gene expression. In summary, we identified a TAL1/FUBP1 transcriptional relationship, whose physiological function in haematopoiesis is connected to proper erythropoiesis."

For 49.3% of the VCZ samples, the therapeutic window between 1.5 and 5.5 μg/ml was reached. Following the first dose VCZ measurement, in subsequent samples the proportion of VCZ C0 within the therapeutic window increased, suggesting effective therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) (P = .001). The VCZ C0 was significantly different (P = .010) between patients with normal metabolism (NMs), intermediate metabolism (IMs), and poor metabolism (PMs). The VZC C0/dose was 12.2 (interquartile range (IQR), 8.33-18.2 μg·ml/kg·day), and 7.68 (IQR, 4.07-16.3 μg·ml/kg·day) in PMs and IMs patients, respectively, which was significantly higher than in NMs phenotype patients (4.68; IQR, 2.51-8.87 μg·ml/kg·day, P = .008 and P = .014).This study demonstrated that the VCZ C0/dose was significantly influenced by the CYP2C19 genotype in South-western Chinese Han patients. In this patient population, more over-exposure was observed in patients with a CYP2C19 genotype associated with poor or intermediate metabolism. CYP2C19 genotype-based dosing combined with TDM will support individualization of VCZ dosing, and potentially will minimize toxicity and maximize therapeutic efficacy."

30652956,"Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) represents a well-recognized complication associated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis therapy, characterized by a reversible epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) at the early stage. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects linked with the long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) AK089579 on the EMT of peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs) as well as the associated regulatory mechanisms of AK089579 downstream of tyrosine kinase 2 (DOK2) and microRNA-296-3p (miR-296-3p). Enrichment analysis, gene intersection association analysis, and a gene-gene intersection network were initially constructed to ascertain whether AK089579 regulated the expression of DOK2 through the mediation of miR-296-3p via the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in PF. After the PF mouse model had been constructed, the expression of the proteins associated with the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and EMT and PMC migration and invasion were all determined accordingly. Based on the obtained results, AK089579 was determined to function as a competing endogenous RNA for miR-296-3p while acting to up-regulate the expression of DOK2, which is a target gene of miR-296-3p. AK089579 was detected to confer an inhibitory effect on the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, whereby the migration and invasion of PMCs among the mice models were suppressed. Meanwhile, up-regulated miR-296-3p and down-regulated DOK2 produced contrasting effects when compared with the aforementioned findings. Treatment with wp10066, a JAK2/STAS3 signaling pathway inhibitor, was shown to reverse the effects exerted by up-regulated miR-296-3p. Taken together, the central findings of the current study present evidence highlighting the capability of the lncRNA AK089579 to bind competitively to miR-296-3p and indirectly enhance the expression of DOK2, which in turn suppresses the activation of the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, whereby the EMT, migration, and invasion of PMCs was inhibited in PF.-Zhang, X. W., Wang, L., Ding, H. Long noncoding RNA AK089579 inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition of peritoneal mesothelial cells by competitively binding to microRNA-296-3p via DOK2 in peritoneal fibrosis."
30652639,"Nanotechnology has been one of the most prominent forefront grounds in several traditional research areas of science and technology, and development of medicines at nanoscale can be reflected by the tremendous surge in market interest. Present outlook: Its applications include various research areas of medicine, drug delivery technology, diagnostic devices, tissue engineering and gene therapy. Along with immense advances, this technology comes with major limitations including potential immune reactivity and complex characterization of these products. Regulatory challenges: The lack of a proper shaped regulatory perspective due infidelities in scientific findings have led to further uncertainties and vagueness of the nanoscale domain, particularly its safety implications. Guideline scenario: Early development pathways and regulations should be a top notch priority to help researchers fail faster and more economically. This would facilitate peaking utility of these materials in medicine without compromising public health and environmental integrity. This review attempts to emphasize on regulatory rationales of key considerations in nanotechnology along with a portray of the present scenario."

30652355,"Emerging evidence has shown that the long noncoding RNA urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) plays a tumor-promoting role in colorectal cancer, while miR-28-5p shows tumor-inhibitory activity in several tumor types. However, the mechanisms both of these in colon cancer progression are still unknown. In this work, the detailed roles and mechanisms of UCA1 and its target genes in colon cancer were studied. The results showed that UCA1 was upregulated in colon cancer tissues when compared with the adjacent nonhumorous tissues, as well as in the various colon cancer cell lines, but the expression of miR-28-5p showed an opposite trend. Furthermore, a high UCA1 level in colon cancer tissues is positively associated with the tumor size and advanced tumor stages. Functional assays revealed that both UCA1 knockdown and miR-28-5p overexpression could inhibit colon cancer cell growth and migration. Further mechanistic studies indicated that UCA1 knockdown played tumor suppressive roles in SW480 and HT116 cells through binding with miR-28-5p. We also, for the first time, identified HOXB3 as the target gene of miR-28-5p and that HOXB3 overexpression could mediate the functions of UCA1 in cell proliferation and migration of colon cancer cells. In conclusion, our data provided evidence for the regulatory network of UCA1/miR-28-5p/HOXB3 in colon cancer, suggesting that UCA1, miR-28-5p, and HOXB3 are the potential targets for colon cancer therapy."
30652345,"Coronary microembolization (CME) occurs when atherosclerotic plaque debris is detached during the treatment of acute coronary syndrome with Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PCI). The complications of distal microvascular embolism, including local myocardial inflammation, are the main causes of myocardial damage and are a strong predictor of poor long-term prognosis and major cardiac adverse events. microRNAs (miRNAs) are involved in the pathophysiological processes of cardiovascular inflammatory diseases. Dysregulation of microRNA (miR)-26a-5p, in particular, is associated with a variety of cardiovascular diseases. However, the role of miR-26a-5p in CME-induced myocardial injury is unclear. In this study, we developed an animal model of CME by injecting microembolic balls into the left ventricle of rats and found that miR-26a-5p expression decreased in myocardial tissue in response. Using a miR-26a-5p mimic, echocardiography, hematoxylin-eosin staining, and Western blot analysis we found that the diminished cardiac function and myocardial inflammation induced by CME is alleviated by miR-26a-5p overexpression. Furthermore, our results show that inhibitors of miR-26a-5p have the opposite effect. In addition, in vitro experiments using real-time PCR, Western blot analysis, and a dual luciferase reporter gene show that HMGA1 is a target gene of miR-26a-5p. Thus, overexpression of miR-26a-5p could be a novel therapy to improve CME-induced myocardial damage."

30651837,"Normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) is a multifactorial optic neuropathy which, similar to open-angle glaucomas, is characterized by progressive retinal ganglion cell death and glaucomatous visual field loss. The major distinction of NTG from open-angle glaucomas is that the intraocular pressure (IOP) does not exceed the normal range. Missing the major risk factor and target of therapy, the elevated IOP, NTG poses a clinical challenge. Several insightful reviews have been published on the pathophysiology of NTG describing the possible underlying mechanisms. The current literature available also suggests that a significant percentage of patients with NTG (as high as 21%) have a family history of glaucoma, indicating a genetic predisposition to the disease. These facts strengthen the indication that NTG remains an enigmatic process. The aim of this review was to summarize the vascular, mechanical and genetic components considered to be responsible for NTG development and to discuss the mechanisms through which they are involved in the pathogenesis of NTG."
30651763,"Colon cancer is one of the most common types of gastrointestinal tumor. Previous studies have demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-(TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) reduces the aggressiveness of colon cancer tumors and promotes the apoptosis of colon carcinoma cells. In the present study, the inhibitory effects of TRAIL were investigated and the potential mechanism of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis was explored in colon cancer cells. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting, immunofluorescence, immunohistochemistry, TUNEL and flow cytometry assays were used to analyze the effects of TRAIL on the growth, migration, invasion and apoptosis of colon tumor cells. <i>In vivo</i> experiments were performed in mice to analyze the therapeutic effects of TRAIL. The results demonstrated that TRAIL significantly suppressed the growth of colorectal tumor cells in a dose-dependent manner (0.5-2.5 mg/ml) and also promoted colon tumor cell death. The migration and invasion of colon tumor cells were inhibited by the downregulation of fibronectin, Vimentin and E-cadherin. The apoptotic rate revealed that TRAIL (2.0 mg/ml) significantly promoted the apoptosis of colon tumor cells by regulating apoptosis-related gene expression. TRAIL administration promoted the apoptosis of colon tumor cells via the exogenous apoptosis signaling pathway due to the upregulation of caspase-3, caspase-8 and nuclear factor-κB protein expression. <i>In vivo</i> assays revealed that TRAIL administration significantly inhibited tumor growth and promoted apoptotic body and lymphocyte infiltration, which led to increased survival in tumor-bearing mice compared with the control group. Immunohistochemistry revealed that P53 and B-cell lymphoma-2 were downregulated in TRAIL-treated tumors. In conclusion, TRAIL treatment significantly inhibited the growth and aggressiveness of colon tumors by inducing apoptosis via the exogenous apoptosis pathway, which suggests that TRAIL may be a potential anticancer agent for colon carcinoma therapy."

30651611,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a major public health concern associated with high morbidity and mortality. Despite decades of research, the pathogenesis of AKI remains incompletely understood and effective therapies are lacking. An increasing body of evidence suggests a role for epigenetic regulation in the process of AKI and kidney repair, involving remarkable changes in histone modifications, DNA methylation and the expression of various non-coding RNAs. For instance, increases in levels of histone acetylation seem to protect kidneys from AKI and promote kidney repair. AKI is also associated with changes in genome-wide and gene-specific DNA methylation; however, the role and regulation of DNA methylation in kidney injury and repair remains largely elusive. MicroRNAs have been studied quite extensively in AKI, and a plethora of specific microRNAs have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AKI. Emerging research suggests potential for microRNAs as novel diagnostic biomarkers of AKI. Further investigation into these epigenetic mechanisms will not only generate novel insights into the mechanisms of AKI and kidney repair but also might lead to new strategies for the diagnosis and therapy of this disease."
30651530,"BACKGROUND This study aimed to investigate the effects of metastasis-associated 1 (MTA1) gene expression and gene silencing in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells in vitro and on angiogenesis in tumor xenografts in vivo in nude mice. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human H460 and H1299 NSCLC cell lines underwent transfection with lentiviral transfer plasmids (lenti) and short-interfering RNA (si-RNA) and included a control group, a lenti-MTA1 group, a lenti-si-MTA1 group, a lenti control group, and a si-RNA control group. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect MTA1 gene expression after cell transfection. MTA1 transfection was more effective in H460 cells, which were selected for further in vivo studies. Sixty Balb/c nude mice, containing human H460 cell tumor xenografts, included a control group (N=20), a lenti-MTA1 group (N=20), and a lenti-si-MTA1 group (N=20). Tumor tissue immunohistochemistry was used to detect the expression of MTA1 protein and microvessel density (MVD) using CD31. Western blot was used to quantify the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), angiopoietin 1/2 (Ang1/2), hypoxia-inducible factor 1-a (HIF-1a), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). RESULTS MTA1 silencing with si-RNA significantly reduced the tumor growth rate in nude mice (p<0.01), reduced tumor MVD, and 70% of mice survived for more than 30 days. MTA1 overexpression resulted in the death of all mice at 30 days after tumor inoculation and upregulated the expression of COX-2, Ang1/2, HIF-1a and VEGF, which were down-regulated by MTA1 silencing. CONCLUSIONS MTA1 gene expression promoted angiogenesis in mouse xenografts from human NSCLC cells."
30651367,"The adeno-associated virus (AAV) serves as a broadly used vector system for <i>in vivo</i> gene delivery. The process of AAV capsid assembly remains poorly understood. The viral co-factor assembly-activating protein (AAP) is required for maximum AAV production and has multiple roles in capsid assembly: trafficking of the structural proteins (VP) to the nuclear site of assembly, promoting stability of VP against multiple degradation pathways, and facilitating stable interactions between VP monomers. The N-terminal 60 amino acids of AAP (AAPN) are essential for these functions. Presumably, AAP must physically interact with VP to execute its multiple functions, but the molecular nature of the AAP-VP interaction is not well understood. Here, we query structurally related AAVs in how they functionally engage AAP from AAV serotype 2 (AAP2) toward virion assembly. These studies led to the identification of key residues on the lumenal capsid surface important for AAP-VP and for VP-VP interactions. Replacing a cluster of glutamic acid residues with a glutamine-rich motif on the conserved VP beta barrel structure of variants incompatible with AAP2 creates a gain-of-function mutant compatible with AAP2. Conversely, mutating positively charged residues within AAP2's hydrophobic region and conserved core domains within AAPN creates a gain-of-function AAP2 mutant that rescues assembly of the incompatible variant. Our results suggest a model for capsid assembly where surface charge/neutrality dictates an interaction between AAPN and the lumenal VP surface to nucleate capsid assembly.<b>IMPORTANCE</b>Efforts to engineer the AAV capsid to gain desirable properties for gene therapy (e.g. tropism, reduced immunogenicity, higher potency) require that capsid modifications do not affect particle assembly. The relationship between VP and the cofactor that facilitates its assembly, AAP, is central to both assembly preservation and vector production. Understanding the requirements for this compatibility can inform manufacturing strategies to maximize production and reduce costs. Additionally, library-based approaches that simultaneously examine a large number of capsid variants would benefit from a universally functional AAP, which could hedge against overlooking variants with potentially valuable phenotypes but that were lost during vector library production due to incompatibility with the cognate AAP. Studying interactions between AAV's structural and nonstructural components enhances our fundamental knowledge of capsid assembly mechanisms and the protein-protein interactions required for productive assembly of the icosahedral capsid."
30651290,"Solid tumors are refractory to cellular immunotherapies in part because they contain suppressive immune effectors such as myeloid‑derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that inhibit cytotoxic lymphocytes. Strategies to reverse the suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) should also attract and activate immune effectors with antitumor activity. To address this need, we developed gene‑modified natural killer (NK) cells bearing a chimeric receptor in which the activating receptor NKG2D is fused to the cytotoxic z-chain of the T-cell receptor (NKG2D.z). NKG2D.z-NK cells target MDSCs, which overexpress NKG2D ligands within the TME. We examined the ability of NKG2D.z-NK cells to eliminate MDSCs in a xenograft TME model and improve the antitumor function of tumor‑directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-modified T cells. We show that NKG2D.z-NK cells are cytotoxic against MDSCs, but spare NKG2D ligand‑expressing normal tissues. NKG2D.z-NK cells, but not unmodified NK cells, secrete pro‑inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to MDSCs at the tumor site and improve infiltration and antitumor activity of subsequently infused CAR-T cells, even in tumors for which an immunosuppressive TME is an impediment to treatment. Unlike endogenous NKG2D, NKG2D.z is not susceptible to TME-mediated down‑modulation and thus maintains its function even within suppressive microenvironments. As clinical confirmation, NKG2D.z-NK cells generated from patients with neuroblastoma killed autologous intra-tumoral MDSCs capable of suppressing CAR-T function. A combination therapy for solid tumors that includes both NKG2D.z-NK cells and CAR‑T cells may improve responses over therapies based on CAR‑T cells alone."
30651283,"Genetic abnormalities provide vital diagnostic and prognostic information in pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and are increasingly used to assign patients to risk groups. We recently proposed a novel classifier based on the copy-number alteration (CNA) profile of the 8 most commonly deleted genes in B-cell precursor ALL. This classifier defined 3 CNA subgroups in consecutive UK trials and was able to discriminate patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics. In this study, we sought to validate the United Kingdom ALL (UKALL)-CNA classifier and reevaluate the interaction with cytogenetic risk groups using individual patient data from 3239 cases collected from 12 groups within the International BFM Study Group. The classifier was validated and defined 3 risk groups with distinct event-free survival (EFS) rates: good (88%), intermediate (76%), and poor (68%) (<i>P</i> < .001). There was no evidence of heterogeneity, even within trials that used minimal residual disease to guide therapy. By integrating CNA and cytogenetic data, we replicated our original key observation that patients with intermediate-risk cytogenetics can be stratified into 2 prognostic subgroups. Group A had an EFS rate of 86% (similar to patients with good-risk cytogenetics), while group B patients had a significantly inferior rate (73%, <i>P</i> < .001). Finally, we revised the overall genetic classification by defining 4 risk groups with distinct EFS rates: very good (91%), good (81%), intermediate (73%), and poor (54%), <i>P</i> < .001. In conclusion, the UKALL-CNA classifier is a robust prognostic tool that can be deployed in different trial settings and used to refine established cytogenetic risk groups."

30651157,"South Africa (SA) is home to a heterogeneous population with a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors. Cholesterol reduction in combination with aggressive management of modifiable risk factors, including nutrition, physical activity, blood pressure and smoking, can help to reduce and prevent morbidity and mortality in individuals who are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. This updated consensus guide to management of dyslipidaemia in SA is based on the updated European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society dyslipidaemia guidelines published in 2016. For individuals who are not considered to be at high or very high cardiovascular risk, the decision whether to treat and which interventional strategy to use is based on a cardiovascular risk score calculated using total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), gender, age and smoking status. The cardiovascular risk score refers to the 10-year risk of any cardiovascular event and includes 4 categories of risk (low, moderate, high and very high). People with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and genetic or severe dyslipidaemias are considered to already be at high or very high risk and do not require risk scoring. Therapeutic lifestyle change is the mainstay of management for all patients. The need for and intensity of drug therapy is determined according to baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels and the target LDL-C concentration appropriate to the individual. LDL-C treatment targets are based on pre-treatment risk and are as follows: &lt;3 mmol/L in low- and moderate risk cases; &lt;2.5 mmol/L and a reduction of at least 50% if the baseline concentration is 2.5 - 5.2 mmol/L in high-risk cases; and &lt;1.8 mmol/L and a reduction of at least 50% if the baseline concentration is 1.8 - 3.5 mmol/L in very high-risk cases. A statin is usually recommended first-line; the specific agent is based on the required degree of cholesterol reduction, comorbidities and co-prescribed medication. Special attention should be paid to children with a family history of genetic or severe dyslipidaemia, who should be screened for dyslipidaemia from 8 years of age. In SA, HIV infection is not considered to be a significant cardiovascular risk factor and treatment recommendations for HIV-positive individuals are the same as for the general population, with careful choice of pharmacotherapy to avoid potential adverse drug-drug interactions. The benefit of statins in individuals older than 70 years is uncertain and clinical judgement should be used to guide treatment decisions and to avoid side-effects and overmedication in this group."
30650974,"The authors present the ocular finding in a patient sent to the Department of Paediatric Ophthalmology at the Children's University Hospital - Faculty of Medicine, Comenius University in Bratislava at the age of 3 months, with congenital glaucoma in her right eye and bilateral high myopia. The family anamnesis of the patient shows repeated occurrence of stunted growth, myopia, facial dysmorphia and cataract. The child's mother had high myopia, the mother's brother underwent cataract surgery, the child's grandmother and her sisters and the child's great grandmother had high myopia and glaucoma, and probably underwent cataract surgery at a young age. The child's mother and grandmother underwent a genetic examination, with a conclusion of Marshall syndrome. Within the framework of neonatal screening, poor cortical auditory evoked potential, a defect of the interventricular septum and bifid uvula were diagnosed in the child. With regard to the overall finding in the patient and the genetic family history, we suspected Marshall syndrome. A genetic examination determined Stickler syndrome type 1 with the presence of mutation in the COL2A gene (variant c.2710C >T (p.Arg904Cys,rs121912882)). Due to high intraocular pressure with the impossibility of compensation by medication, bilateral trabuculectomy was performed on the patient. At present the patient has intraocular pressure compensated with adjuvant medicamentous therapy. With regard to high myopia and pronounced degenerative changes on the periphery of the retina in the sense of lattice degeneration, preventive cryopexy of the retinal periphery is planned. A molecular genetic analysis helped diagnose the pathology as Stickler syndrome type 1, which manifested phenotype symptoms of Marshall syndrome or Stickler syndrome type 2. Key words: Marshall syndrome, Stickler syndrome, mid-facial dysmorfism, myopia, glaucoma, cataract."
30650942,"Acromegaly is a chronic systemic disease mainly caused by a growth hormone (GH)- secreting pituitary neuroendocrine tumor (PitNETs), which is associated with many health complications and increased mortality when not adequately treated. Transsphenoidal surgery is considered the treatment of choice in GH-secreting PitNETs, but patients in whom surgery cannot be considered or with persistent disease after surgery require medical therapy. Treatment with available synthetic somatostatin analogues (SSAs) is considered the mainstay in the medical management of acromegaly which exert their beneficial effects through the binding to a family of G-protein coupled receptors encoded by 5 genes (SSTR1- 5). However, although it has been demonstrated that the SST1-5 receptors are physically present in tumor cells, SSAs are in many cases ineffective (i.e. approximately 10-30% of patients with GH-secreting PitNET are unresponsive to SSAs), suggesting that other cellular/molecular determinants could be essential for the response to the pharmacological treatment in patients with GH-secreting PitNETs. Therefore, the scrutiny of these determinants might be used for the identification of subgroups of patients in whom an appropriate pharmacological treatment can be successfully employed (responders vs. non- responders). In this review, we will describe some of the existing, classical and novel, genetic and molecular determinants involved in the response of patients with GH-secreting PitNETs to the available therapeutic treatments, as well as new molecular/therapeutic approaches that could be potentially useful for the treatment GH-secreting PitNETs."
30650650,"Although the application of cardioprotective ischaemia/reperfusion (I/R) stimuli after myocardial infarction (MI) is a promising concept for salvaging the myocardium, translation to a clinical scenario has not fulfilled expectations. We have previously shown that in pigs, ischaemic postconditioning (IPostC) reduces myocardial oedema and microvascular obstruction (MVO), without influencing myocardial infarct size. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanisms underlying the IPostC-induced microvascular protection by transcriptomic analysis, followed by pathway analysis. Closed-chest reperfused MI was induced by 90 min percutaneous balloon occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery, followed by balloon deflation in anaesthetised pigs. Animals were randomised to IPostC (<i>n</i> = 8), MI (non-conditioned, <i>n</i> = 8), or Control (sham-operated, <i>n</i> = 4) groups. After three hours or three days follow-up, myocardial tissue samples were harvested and subjected to RNA-seq analysis. Although the transcriptome analysis revealed similar expression between IPostC and MI in transcripts involved in cardioprotective pathways, we identified gene expression changes responding to IPostC at the three days follow-up. Focal adhesion signaling, downregulated genes participating in cardiomyopathy and activation of blood cells may have critical consequences for microvascular protection. Specific analyses of the gene subsets enriched in the endothelium of the infarcted area, revealed strong deregulation of transcriptional functional clusters, DNA processing, replication and repair, cell proliferation, and focal adhesion, suggesting sustentative function in the endothelial cell layer protection and integrity. The spatial and time-dependent transcriptome analysis of porcine myocardium supports a protective effect of IPostC on coronary microvasculature post-MI."
30650588,"The SA-4-1BBL, an oligomeric novel form of the natural ligand for the 4-1BB co-stimulatory receptor of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily, as a recombinant protein has potent pleiotropic effects on cells of innate, adaptive, and regulatory immunity with demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in several tumor models. However, the production of soluble form of SA-4-1BBL protein and quality control is time and resource intensive and face various issues pertinent to clinical development of biologics. The present study sought to take advantage of the simplicity and translatability of DNA-based vaccines for the production and delivery of SA-4-1BBL for cancer immune prevention and therapy. A chimeric HPV-16 E7 DNA vaccine (SP-SA-E7-4-1BBL) was constructed that contains the signal peptide (SP) of calreticulin (CRT), streptavidin (SA) domain of SA-4-1BBL, HPV-16 E7 double mutant gene, and the extracellular domain of mouse 4-1BBL. Immunization by gene gun with SP-SA-E7-4-1BBL induced greater prophylactic as well as therapeutic effects in C57BL/6 mice against TC-1 tumor model compared with immunization with E7wt, SP-SA-4-1BBL or reference-positive control CRT-E7wt. The therapeutic efficacy of the DNA vaccine was associated with increased frequency of E7-specific T cells producing interferon (IFN)-γ. Overall, our data suggest that this DNA-based vaccine strategy might represent a translational approach because it provides a simpler and versatile alternative to a subunit vaccine based on SA-4-1BBL and E7 proteins."

Single subcutaneously injected doses of ELX-02 between 0.3 mg/kg and 7.5 mg/kg showed an acceptable safety profile without severe or serious drug-related adverse events, including a lack of renal and ototoxicity events. Injection of ELX-02 resulted in a rapid time to peak concentration and elimination phase, with complete elimination from the vascular compartment within 10 hours. ELX-02 area under the concentration-time curve to infinity showed dose-exposure linearity (24-fold increase for a 25-fold dose increase), and the maximum concentration showed dose proportionality (17-fold increase for a 25-fold increase). The mean apparent volume of distribution was dose dependent, suggesting an increased distribution and tissue uptake of ELX-02 at higher doses. The primary route of excretion was in the urine, with the majority of the compound excreted unchanged. These results support the evaluation of the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of repeat dosing in future studies."
30650148,"Bladder cancer (BC) is the 9th most common cancer diagnosis worldwide. Low grade (LG) represents 70% of all BCs, characterized by recurrence and rare ability (10-15%) to progress to high grade (HG) and invade. The remaining 30% is high grade (HG), fast invasive BC, which is resistant to therapy. Identifying biomarkers for predicting those tumors able to progress is a key goal for patient outcome improvement. This study focuses on the most promising prognostic markers."
30649896,"Triadin knockout syndrome (TKOS) is a rare, inherited arrhythmia syndrome caused by recessive null mutations in TRDN-encoded cardiac triadin. Based previously on five TRDN null patients, TKOS has been characterized by extensive T-wave inversions, transient QT prolongation, and severe disease expression of exercise-induced cardiac arrest in early childhood refractory to conventional therapy."
30649763,"Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a potential source of blood cells for transfusion therapies and a promising tool for studying the ontogeny of hematopoiesis. The development of widely varying reprogramming methods has enabled us nowadays to obtain iPSCs even from a small number of antigen-specific T cells from patients. As these T-cell-derived iPSCs (T-iPSCs) carry TCR gene rearrangements in their genomic DNA, they are likely useful for producing antigen-specific T cells and for studying T-cell development. T-cell immunotherapy is potentially an effective therapeutic strategy against many types of cancers and viral infections. If antigen-specific T cells tailored against diseases and for patients can be easily obtained, T-cell immunotherapy should become a popular choice of therapy. Here, we show the in vitro way to guide T-iPSCs sequentially to yield hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), T-lineage cells, and mature CD8 single-positive T cells. These in vitro-generated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells display antigen-specific cytotoxity and perform general T-cell functions. This novel protocol thus provides means to generate antigen-specific T cells as well as chances to study normal human lymphopoiesis. It may help identify, and then clear away, barriers to T-cell immunotherapy such as immunological tolerance and cell exhaustion. T-iPSCs can confer their juvenile status upon their descendant T cells during pluripotency reprogramming and redifferentiation. This phenomenon should help to eliminate T-cell exhaustion."
30649440,"Constitutional loss of function (LOF) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in pattern recognition receptors FPR1, TLR3, and TLR4 have previously been reported to predict oxaliplatin benefit in colorectal cancer. Confirmation of this association could substantially improve patient stratification."
30649389,"Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is a rare late onset genetic disease leading to ptosis, dysphagia, and proximal limb muscles at later stages. A short abnormal (GCN) triplet expansion in the polyA-binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) gene leads to PABPN1-containing aggregates in the muscles of OPMD patients. Here we demonstrate that treating mice with guanabenz acetate (GA), an FDA-approved antihypertensive drug, reduces the size and number of nuclear aggregates, improves muscle force, protects myofibers from the pathology-derived turnover and decreases fibrosis. GA targets various cell processes, including the unfolded protein response (UPR), which acts to attenuate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. We demonstrate that GA increases both the phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiator factor 2α subunit (eIF2α) and the splicing of Xbp1, key components of the UPR. Altogether these data show that modulation of protein folding regulation is beneficial for OPMD and promote the further development of GA or its derivatives for treatment of OPMD in humans. Furthermore, they support the recent evidences that treating ER stress could be therapeutically relevant in other more common proteinopathies."
30649349,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs), including exosomes and microvesicles, are potent and clinically valuable tools for early diagnosis, prognosis and potentially the targeted treatment of cancer. The content of EVs is closely related to the type and status of the EV-secreting cell. Circulating exosomes are a source of stable RNAs including mRNAs, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)."
30649249,"Neurosurgical repair in patients with proximal nerve lesions results in unsatisfactory recovery of function. Gene therapy for neurotrophic factors is a powerful strategy to promote axon regeneration. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) gene therapy promotes motor neuron survival and axon outgrowth; however, uncontrolled delivery of GDNF results in axon entrapment. We report that time-restricted GDNF expression (1 month) using an immune-evasive doxycycline-inducible gene switch attenuated local axon entrapment in avulsed reimplanted ventral spinal roots, was sufficient to promote long-term motor neuron survival (24 weeks) and facilitated the recovery of compound muscle action potentials by 8 weeks. These improvements were associated with an increase in long-distance regeneration of motor axons. In contrast, persistent GDNF expression impaired axon regeneration by inducing axon entrapment. These findings demonstrate that timed expression can resolve the deleterious effect of uncontrolled growth factor delivery and shows that inducible growth factor gene therapy can be employed to enhance the efficacy of axon regeneration after neurosurgical repair of a proximal nerve lesion in rats. This preclinical study is an important step in the ongoing development of a neurotrophic factor gene therapy for patients with severe proximal nerve lesions."
30649027,"Trichotillomania (TTM) is a disorder characterized by the individual pulling out his hair in a repetitive manner, resulting in significant hair loss, a feeling of tension before the hair pulling, and pleasure during it. Our understanding of the neurobiological basis of TTM is limited. However, the condition in all likelihood involves multiple pathways and a complex interaction between various genetic, psychological, and social factors. Vitamin D deficiency is thought to be linked to rickets in children and to a range of different diseases in adults, including osteoporosis, osteomalacia, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, dermatological diseases, and psychiatric disorders. We report a case of a 4-year-old girl with TTM triggered by vitamin D deficiency resolving dramatically with vitamin D therapy."
30648985,"Charles is a 10-year-old African-American male who presents to the Developmental Behavioral Pediatrics Clinic for evaluation of his learning. His primary care provider (PCP) was concerned that his developmental delays were negatively affecting his ability to engage in his homeschooling curriculum and also that his mother seemed unaware of the severity of his delays. Neuropsychological evaluation had been recommended by the PCP several times in the past, but the family declined. At one point, the PCP had considered potential child protective services (CPS) referral for medical neglect because of missed appointments and lack of follow-through on recommendations, which motivated the parent to bring him to this appointment.Medical history was significant for failure to thrive and hypotonia in infancy. Charles received physical therapy through early childhood for hypotonia and motor coordination deficits. His mother removed him from public school and initiated homeschooling in kindergarten after he suffered a dental injury at recess of which she was not notified. The current homeschooling (fourth grade) approach was described as ""off and on"" activities for 3 hours daily. His mother acknowledged that she struggled to get him to participate as he preferred using the computer and tablet rather than doing school work, and they also argued regularly about his impulsive eating. The patient's mother also described her own medical conditions that contributed to a high degree of stress and fatigue, which she felt made homeschooling more difficult.On examination, the patient was obese and had widely set, almond-shaped eyes; a wide-based gait; an immature pencil grasp; and a mild truncal and appendicular hypotonia. Performance on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test, second edition, was below average for the verbal scale (78) and low average for the nonverbal scale (89). On the Wechsler Individualized Achievement Test, third edition, he was unable to perform any multiplication, could not write his own last name (was practicing tracing at home per maternal report), and read at a below first-grade reading level (standardized scores could not be calculated). His conversations with the examiner were mainly limited to the topic of video games. He spoke in short sentences with approximately 85% intelligibility but with coordinated gaze. He appeared mentally exhausted as testing progressed.Feedback to the parent included concern for a learning disability possibly associated with a genetic condition such as Prader-Willi syndrome (because of the history of hypotonia and impulsive eating), and genetic testing was recommended. Because of Charles' difficulty accessing the homeschool curriculum, a special education evaluation through the local public school district was also recommended, but his mother resisted, stating that she felt public special education ""keeps children like him down"" by focusing primarily on African-American children and stigmatizing their differences.The mother does not return phone calls made 1 month later to follow-up on considering a special education evaluation, and team members raise concern about medical neglect. What would you do next?"
30648747,"Anastrozole is a widely prescribed aromatase inhibitor for the therapy of estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer. We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for plasma anastrozole concentrations in 687 postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer. The top single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) signal mapped across SLC38A7 (rs11648166, p = 2.3E-08) which we showed to encode an anastrozole influx transporter. The second most significant signal (rs28845026, p = 5.4E-08) mapped near ALPPL2 and displayed epistasis with the SLC38A7 signal. Both of these SNPs were cis eQTLs for these genes, and patients homozygous for variant genotypes for both SNPs had the highest drug concentrations, the highest SLC38A7 expression and the lowest ALPPL2 expression. In summary, our GWAS identified a novel gene encoding an anastrozole transporter, SLC38A7, as well as epistatic interaction between SNPs in that gene and SNPs near ALPPL2 that influenced both the expression of the transporter and anastrozole plasma concentrations.

30648470,"Although mouse models of epithelial-mesenchymal interaction-based whole tooth regeneration have been generated, whether this strategy can be applied to humans remains unknown and pre-clinical investigations using a large animal model are required. Here, we describe the development of feasible methods for whole tooth regeneration in a swine model. We characterized the odontogenesis of dissociated single cells from early stage tooth germs from miniature pigs (minipigs) in vitro by tracking the morphogenesis of re-associated cell pellets in an organ culture system. Despite loss of positional information, re-associated individual dental epithelial and mesenchymal cells retained their odontogenic potential and continued to recapitulate typical dental histogenesis and morphogenesis. Based on the developmental biology of natural teeth, we allo-transplanted re-associated tooth germs into the jawbones of minipigs and manipulated whole tooth regeneration by mimicking the process of tooth development. To overcome the challenge of allo-immune rejection, bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) were systemically infused, along with local aspirin administration, during allo-transplantation. Radiographic data confirmed the survival and growth of the explants in minipig jawbones. Histological analysis revealed that the explants formed well-developed tooth structures and contained normally arranged dental components, including organized dentin, cementum, periodontal membrane, dental pulp, vasculature, and nervous tissue, closely resembling those of natural teeth. In conclusion, this study achieved orthotopic whole tooth regeneration and development in a large mammal using a cell reassociation approach, supporting the potential for regeneration of human teeth in situ."
30648440,"Normalizing serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) levels by lifelong treatment with levothyroxine (LT4) remains the primary goal of therapy for patients with hypothyroidism. The reference ranges for TSH are derived from populations with (supposedly) normal thyroid function. But, TSH results are affected by a number of factors including alterations in TSH levels with age, concurrent illnesses, circadian rhythm, inter- and intra-assay differences, and some commonly used medications that interfere with thyroid function or the TSH test. Furthermore, some patients are complex to manage and bringing serum TSH to within its reference range does not always resolve their symptoms of hypothyroidism. Furthermore, changes in TSH within the reference range may provoke symptoms in some sensitive patients, and others may have a personal ""set point"" for thyroid hormone levels that represents normal function for that individual, but which is outside the population reference range. The introduction of updated LT4 formulations, with better dosing accuracy and stability compared with older versions, should, in theory at least, provide better stability and accuracy of dosing over time. However, the new LT4 formulations are associated with manifold increases in the number of self-reported adverse events. Therefore, patients with hypothyroidism as well as the clinicians managing them need to better understand the utility as well as the limitations of the widely used TSH measurement. In addition, both pharmaceutical companies and the prescribing clinician need to take greater care when patients are switched from older to newer formulations."
30648435,"CRISPR editing is being considered as a potential gene repair therapy to treat Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a dystrophin-deficient lethal muscle disease affecting all muscles in the body. A recent preliminary study from the Olson laboratory (Amoasii et al. 2018 Science 362:89-91) showed robust dystrophin restoration in a canine DMD model following intramuscular or intravenous delivery of the CRISPR editing machinery by adeno-associated virus serotype-9 (AAV9). Despite the limitation of the small sample size, short study duration and the lack of muscle function data, the Olson lab findings have provided important proof-of-principle for scaling up the CRISPR therapy from rodents to large mammals. Future large-scale, long-term, and comprehensive studies are warranted to establish the safety and efficacy of CRISPR editing therapy in large mammals."
30648251,"AADC deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease that may lead to movement disorder and/or autonomic dysfunction. The prognosis of AADC deficiency patients is poor, and most die in childhood. Gene therapy is the only method currently available to help alleviate related symptoms. Gene therapy involves the injection of adeno-associated viral (AV) vector into the basal ganglia of patients, helping transfer the AADC gene and leading to improved AADC production and higher numbers of neurotransmitters in the brain. Moreover, as patients are unable to produce catecholamine, they may also suffer from a disorder affecting the regulatory control of the autonomic nervous system, resulting in hypoglycemia, which often causes imbalances in thermoregulation and hemodynamic and functional adjustments during surgery. Furthermore, the use of analgesics and inhalational anesthetics increase the risks of hypotension and bradycardia. Thus, in addition to assessing cardiac and respiratory system functions, it is important to evaluate the patient's airway before administering anesthesia, as structural anomalies or other situations may be present that lead to difficulties in tracheal intubation. Various airway tools, anesthesia equipment, and alternative plans should thus be prepared to protect the airway and maintain vital signs. All of the abovementioned issues increase the risks of AADC deficiency patients undergoing general anesthesia. The development of gene transfection for genetic diseases is a future trend. This paper identifies possible problems and related responses in perioperative patient care during gene therapy. The authors hope that these experiences provide references for the administration of AADC and similar gene therapies in the future."

30647950,"The aim is to evaluate the effects of anticoagulant therapy (Enoxaparine) compared to antiaggregant therapy (Aspirin) on pregnancy outcome depending on the mutational status of clotting factors. The study was conducted prospectively over a 2 years period and included 110 pregnant women, of whom 80 patients diagnosed with hereditary thrombophilia and 30 healthy pregnant women, representing the control group. After careful observation, we concluded a positive influence of Enoxaparine on pregnancy outcome in pregnant women homozygous carriers for factor V Leiden gene mutation and compound heterozygous for Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin G20210A gene mutation. The study did not find significant positive results in women with heterozygous Factor V Leiden and G20210A prothrombin gene mutation who received anticoagulant therapy as well as pregnant women who received low-dose Aspirin compared with controls."
30647843,"KLHL family genes are noted for their involvement in the E3 ligase ubiquitination pathway through binding with Cullin-3 (CUL3) resulting in degradation of specific binding partners. KLHLs are thus intriguing genes for cancer as they can directly influence the degradation of therapeutically relevant cell cycle regulators such as Aurora Kinase, PLK1, or CDK1. However, most KLHL family members remain understudied within the literature. This study explores the relationship of expression of KLHL member, <i>KLHL5</i>, with the pharmacologic effect of anti-cancer drugs. <i>KLHL5</i> knockdown decreased the proliferation and viability of cancer cells and sensitized cancer cells to numerous anti-cancer drugs. Drugs related to cell cycle including Akt/PI3K/mTOR inhibitors were especially sensitized by <i>KLHL5</i> knockdown. The potential of KLHL5 as a prognostic or diagnostic cancer marker was compared to other KLHLs through a pan-cancer study of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) tumor groups. While KLHL5 expression shows marginal dysregulation in cancer, other KLHLs exhibit significant dysregulation in all cancer types, and exceptionally in renal carcinomas. This study advocates for further study of KLHLs as potential alternative therapeutic targets, since while <i>KLHL5</i> is a novel gene impacting anticancer drug effects, others may have a similar impact on drug effect while having greater potential as diagnostic or prognostic markers."
30647841,"Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease where the survival rate of patients decreases with progression of the disease. BC usually has a linear progression, classified into normal/benign, atypical ductal hyperplasia (ADH), ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS), and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). This study aimed to identify gene signature for each of these subgroups. We performed human transcriptome array analysis on 5 patient samples from each Normal, ADH, IDC and DCIS and 2 replicates of MCF10A cell line representative of each subgroup. We identified <i>SFRP1</i> and snoRNAs (especially <i>SNORD115</i> and <i>SNORD114</i>) as the initial regulators of cancer progression, accompanied by significant changes in extracellular matrix organization. Tumor progression to the IDC stage showed upregulation of tumor promoting genes responsible for increased invasion, inflammation, survival in stress environment and metastasis. The gene signatures identified in this study could represent potential biomarkers for each subgroup of breast cancer progression, which could assist in early diagnosis of breast cancer progression as well as treatment interventions. Moreover, these gene signatures could serve in discovery of specific targeted therapies for each subgroup."

30647685,"PKU patients react to therapy with a low phenylalanine diet, but adherence to this diet is troublesome, subsequently the expansion of alternative ways is demand. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) is one of this ways, which converts phenylalanine to harmless metabolites; trans-cinnamic acid and ammonia. In the current study, the extraction of PAL enzyme was used to investigate the efficiency for production of functional PKU egg white and mushroom flour with good quality by evaluation of colour characteristics, determination of phenylalanine concentrations and genetic materials expression of PKU related genes and DNA damage. Results indicated that the PAL enzyme treated of egg white and mushroom flour was stable colour and the calculated reduction per cent in phenylalanine concentration from female mice fed on untreated and PAL-treated samples was 22.77% in egg white and 31.37% in mushroom flour. Also, the results revealed that female mice fed on diet contained treated egg white exhibited low expression levels of PKU exons (3, 6, 7, 11, and 12) and low DNA damage which were similar to those in control mice."
30647473,"Paramyotonia congenita is a non-dystrophic myotonia, in which muscle relaxation is delayed after voluntary or evoked contraction. This condition cannot be distinguished on the basis of symptoms and signs alone. It requires consideration of genetics as more than 100 mutations in the CLCN1 gene and at least 20 mutations in the SCN4A gene are associated with the clinical features of the non-dystrophic myotonias. Only a few families with the described features but no genetic testing have been reported in Slovakia. This prompted us to investigate genetic mutations in the SCN4A gene in 3 Slovak families clinically diagnosed with paramyotonia."
30647444,"Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug given to patients before and after having a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Genomic variants in the CYP2C19 gene are associated with variable enzyme activities affecting drug metabolism and hence, patients with reduced or increased enzymatic function have increased risk of bleeding. We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare a pharmacogenomics versus a non-pharmacogenomics-guided clopidogrel treatment for coronary artery syndrome patients undergoing PCI in the Spanish healthcare setting. A total of 549 patients diagnosed with coronary artery disease followed by PCI were recruited. Dual antiplatelet therapy was administrated to all patients from 1 to 12 months after PCI. Patients were classified into two groups: the Retrospective group was treated with clopidogrel based on the clinical routine practice and the Prospective group were initially genotyped for the presence of CYP2C19 variant alleles before treatment with those carrying more than one CYP2C19 variant alleles given prasugrel treatment. We collected data on established clinical and health outcome measures, including, per treatment arm: the percentage of patients that suffered from (a) myocardial infraction, (b) major bleeding and minor bleeding, (c) stroke, (d) the number of hospitalization days, and (e) the number of days patients spent in Intensive Care Unit. Our primary outcome measure for the cost-effectiveness analysis was Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALYs). To estimate the treatment cost for each patient, individual data on its resource used were combined with unit price data, obtained from Spanish national sources. The analysis predicts a survival of 0.9446 QALYs in the pharmacogenomics arm and 0.9379 QALYs in the non-pharmacogenomics arm within a 1-year horizon. The cumulative costs per patient were €2971 and €3205 for the Prospective and Retrospective groups, respectively. The main cost driver of total cost in both arms was hospitalization costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was negative indicating that the PGx was a dominant option. Our data show that pharmacogenomics-guided clopidogrel treatment strategy may represent a cost-effective choice compared with non-pharmacogenomics-guided strategy for patients undergoing PCI."

Here, we test MIP on a third independent population."
30646988,"Synthetic biology aims to endow living cells with new functions by incorporating functional gene networks into them. By overexpressing, blocking and rewiring native gene pathways, synthetic biologists have harnessed this promising technology to reprogram cells to perform diverse tasks such as drug discovery, biopharmaceutical manufacturing, gene therapy and tissue engineering, etc. In this review, we focus on current technologies of synthetic biosensors for disease detection. We start with the design principle of synthetic biosensors. Then we move towards the characteristics of simple synthetic biosensors, which can respond to a single input signal, and complex synthetic biosensors including Boolean gate biosensors, cascade biosensors, time-delay biosensors, oscillator biosensors and hysteretic biosensors, which can respond to more than two input signals and perform complex tasks. Synthetic biosensor has showed great potential in disease detection, but it is still in its infancy stage. More efforts should be made in identifying and constructing clinically relevant regulation systems. Computational tools are also needed in the design process in order to guarantee the precision of the synthetic biosensor. The ultimate goal of a synthetic biosensor is to act as a therapeutic sensor-effector device that connects diagnostic input with therapeutic output and therefore provides all-in-one diagnostic and therapeutic solutions for future gene- and cell-based therapies."
30646957,"Chemoradiotherapy (CRT) remains one of the most common cancer treatment modalities, and recent data suggest that CRT is maximally effective when there is generation of an anti-tumoral immune response. However, CRT has also been shown to promote immunosuppressive mechanisms which must be blocked or reversed to maximize its immune stimulating effects."
30646956,"Levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) are a prevalent side effect of chronic treatment with levodopa (L-DOPA) for the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has long been hypothesized that serotonergic neurons of the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) are capable of L-DOPA uptake and dysregulated release of dopamine (DA), and that this ""false neurotransmission"" phenomenon is a main contributor to LID development. Indeed, many preclinical studies have demonstrated LID management with serotonin receptor agonist treatment, but unfortunately, promising preclinical data has not been translated in large-scale clinical trials. Importantly, while there is an abundance of convincing clinical and preclinical evidence supporting a role of maladaptive serotonergic neurotransmission in LID expression, there is no direct evidence that dysregulated DA release from serotonergic neurons impacts LID formation. In this study, we ectopically expressed the DA autoreceptor D2R<sub>s</sub> (or GFP) in the DRN of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats. No negative impact on the therapeutic efficacy of L-DOPA was seen with rAAV-D2R<sub>s</sub> therapy. However, D2R<sub>s</sub> treated animals, when subjected to a LID-inducing dose regimen of L-DOPA, remained completely resistant to LID, even at high doses. Moreover, the same subjects remained resistant to LID formation when treated with direct DA receptor agonists, suggesting D2R<sub>s</sub> activity in the DRN blocked dyskinesogenic L-DOPA priming of striatal neurons. In vivo microdialysis confirmed that DA efflux in the striatum was reduced with rAAV-D2R<sub>s</sub> treatment, providing explicit evidence that abnormal DA release from DRN neurons can affect LID. This is the first direct evidence of dopaminergic neurotransmission in DRN neurons and its modulation with rAAV-D2R<sub>s</sub> gene therapy confirms the serotonin hypothesis in LID, demonstrating that regulation of serotonergic neurons achieved with a gene therapy approach offers a novel and potent antidyskinetic therapy."

About 30%-40% BC patients who are diagnosed as invasive carcinoma HR-positive BC would eventually develop metastatic breast cancers. In 2016, FALCON trial proves Fulvestrant as an effective first-line endocrine therapy for post-menopause HR-positive advanced BC (ABC) patients. But even after FALCON published, Fulvestrant is rarely used as first-line in real world ABC patients in China."

30646512,"Colorectal Cancer is the third most common cancer diagnosed in the US. While the incidence and the mortality rate of colorectal cancer has decreased due to effective cancer screening measures, there has been an increase in number of young patients diagnosed in colon cancer due to unclear reasons at this point of time. While environmental and genetic factors play a major role in the pathogenesis of colon cancer, extensive research has suggested that nutrition may play both a causal and protective role in the development of colon cancer. In this review article, we aim to provide a review of factors that play a major role in development of colorectal cancer."
30646511,"Obstacles to effective therapies for mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs) determine the need for continuous studies in order to enhance therapeutic strategies. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is frequently utilised as a solvent in biological studies, and as a vehicle for drug therapy and the in vivo administration of water-insoluble substances. In the light of the uncertainty on the mechanisms of DMSO impact on metabolism of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) pathologically accumulated in MPSs, in this work, we made an attempt to investigate and resolve the question of the nature of GAG level modulation by DMSO, the isoflavone genistein solvent employed previously by our group in MPS treatment. In this work, we first found the cytotoxic effect of DMSO on human fibroblasts at concentrations above 3%. Also, our results displayed the potential role of DMSO in the regulation of biological processes at the transcriptional level, then demonstrated a moderate impact of the solvent on GAG synthesis. Interestingly, alterations of lysosomal ultrastructure upon DMSO treatment were visible. As there is growing evidence in the literature that DMSO can affect cellular pathways leading to numerous changes, it is important to expand our knowledge concerning this issue."

30645967,"South Africa (SA) is home to a heterogeneous population with a wide range of cardiovascular risk factors. Cholesterol reduction in combination with aggressive management of modifiable risk factors, including nutrition, physical activity, blood pressure and smoking, can help to reduce and prevent morbidity and mortality in individuals who are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. This updated consensus guide to management of dyslipidaemia in SA is based on the updated European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society dyslipidaemia guidelines published in 2016. For individuals who are not considered to be at high or very high cardiovascular risk, the decision whether to treat and which interventional strategy to use is based on a cardiovascular risk score calculated using total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), gender, age and smoking status. The cardiovascular risk score refers to the 10-year risk of any cardiovascular event and includes 4 categories of risk (low, moderate, high and very high). People with established cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease and genetic or severe dyslipidaemias are considered to already be at high or very high risk and do not require risk scoring. Therapeutic lifestyle change is the mainstay of management for all patients. The need for and intensity of drug therapy is determined according to baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) levels and the target LDL-C concentration appropriate to the individual. LDL-C treatment targets are based on pre-treatment risk and are as follows: &lt;3 mmol/L in low- and moderate risk cases; &lt;2.5 mmol/L and a reduction of at least 50% if the baseline concentration is 2.5 - 5.2 mmol/L in high-risk cases; and &lt;1.8 mmol/L and a reduction of at least 50% if the baseline concentration is 1.8 - 3.5 mmol/L in very high-risk cases. A statin is usually recommended first-line; the specific agent is based on the required degree of cholesterol reduction, comorbidities and co-prescribed medication. Special attention should be paid to children with a family history of genetic or severe dyslipidaemia, who should be screened for dyslipidaemia from 8 years of age. In SA, HIV infection is not considered to be a significant cardiovascular risk factor and treatment recommendations for HIV-positive individuals are the same as for the general population, with careful choice of pharmacotherapy to avoid potential adverse drug-drug interactions. The benefit of statins in individuals older than 70 years is uncertain and clinical judgement should be used to guide treatment decisions and to avoid side-effects and overmedication in this group."
30645726,"Levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID) is the main side effect associated with levodopa treatment and represents the biggest challenge for Parkinson's disease therapy. While the overexpression of ΔFosB transcription factor is related to the development of LID, few studies have been undertaken on fosB gene transcriptional regulation induced by levodopa in vivo. The aim of this study is to evaluate the expression of ΔFosB mRNA and FosB mRNA in the striatum after acute, chronic, and subchronic levodopa treatment in rats with unilateral 6-OHDA-lesion in the medial forebrain bundle. qRT-PCR was used to compare the levels of ΔFosB and FosB mRNA expression in the dopamine-denervated striatum following levodopa treatment. While the results obtained after a single levodopa dose indicate a significant increase of ∆FosB mRNA expression in the striatum 1 h post-injection, the levels returned to baseline values after 24 h. After subchronic levodopa treatment, the levels of ∆FosB and FosB mRNA expression were lower 1 h post-administration of levodopa in comparison with acute effect. However, after chronic levodopa treatment, ∆FosB mRNA expression in the striatum persisted in dyskinetic rats only, and positive correlation was found between the levels of ∆FosB mRNA expression 1 h after levodopa administration and the level of dyskinetic severity. In summary, acute levodopa treatment led to highly increased levels of ∆FosB mRNA expression in the striatum. While repeated administration induced a partial desensitization of the fosB gene in the striatum, it did not suppress its activity completely, which could explain why dyskinesia appears after chronic levodopa treatment."
30645721,"Blood pressure (BP) is a complex trait that is regulated by multiple physiological pathways and include but is not limited to extracellular fluid volume homeostasis, cardiac contractility, and vascular tone through renal, neural, or endocrine systems. Uncontrolled hypertension (HTN) has been associated with an increased mortality risk. Therefore, understanding the genetics that underpins and influence BP regulation will have a major impact on public health. Moreover, uncontrolled HTN has been linked to inter-individual variation in the drugs' response and this has been associated with an individual's genetics architecture. However, the identification of candidate genes that underpin the genetic basis of HTN remains a major challenge. To date, few variants associated with inter-individual BP regulation have been identified and replicated. Research in this field has accelerated over the past 5 years as a direct result of on-going genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the progress in the identification of rare gene variants and mutations, epigenetic markers, and the regulatory pathways involved in the pathophysiology of BP. In this review we describe and enhance our current understanding of how genetic variants account for the observed variability in BP response in patients on first-line antihypertensive drugs, amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide."
30645616,"The health economic evidence about the value and optimal targeting of genetic testing in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) events has remained limited and ambiguous. The objective of this study is to optimize the population-level use and targeting of genetic testing alongside traditional risk factors in the prevention of CHD events and, thereby, to assess the cost-benefit of genetic testing."
30645595,"Antisense molecules used as antibiotics offer the potential to keep up with acquired resistance, by redesigning the sequence of an antisense. Once bacteria acquire resistance by mutating the targeted sequence, new antisense can readily be designed by using sequence information of a target gene. However, antisense molecules require additional delivery vehicles to get into bacteria and be protected from degradation. Based on progress in the last few years it appears that, while redesigning or finding new delivery vehicle will be more difficult than redesigning the antisense cargo, it will perhaps be less difficult than finding new conventional small molecule antibiotics. In this study we propose a protocol that maximizes the combined advantages of engineered delivery vehicle and antisense cargo by decreasing the immediate growth advantage to the pathogen of mutating the entry mechanisms and increasing the advantage to the pathogen of antisense target mutations. Using this protocol, we show by computer simulation an appropriately designed antisense therapy can potentially be effective many times longer than conventional antibiotics before succumbing to resistance. While the simulations describe an in-vitro situation, based on comparison with other in-vitro studies on acquired resistance we believe the advantages of the combination antisense strategy have the potential to provide much more sustainability in vivo than conventional antibiotic therapy."
30645189,"Central hypothyrodism (CeH) is a hypothyroid state caused by an insufficient stimulation by thyrotropin (TSH) of an otherwise normal thyroid gland. Several advancements, including the recent publication of expert guidelines for CeH diagnosis and management, have been made in recent years thus increasing the clinical awareness on this condition. Here we reviewed the recent advancements and give expert opinions on critical issues. Indeed, CeH can be the consequence of various disorders affecting either the pituitary gland or the hypothalamus. Recent data enlarged the list of candidate genes for heritable CeH and a genetic origin may be the underlying cause for CeH discovered in pediatric or even adult patients without apparent pituitary lesions. This raises the doubt that the frequency of CeH may be underestimated. CeH is most frequently diagnosed as consequence of the biochemical assessments in patients with hypothalamic/pituitary lesions. In contrast with primary hypothyroidism, low FT4 with low/normal TSH levels are the biochemical hallmark of CeH and adequate thyroid hormone replacement leads to the suppression of residual TSH secretion. Thus, CeH often represents a clinical challenge because physicians cannot rely on the use of the ""reflex TSH strategy"" for screening or therapy monitoring. Nevertheless, in contrast with general assumption, the finding of normal TSH levels may indicate thyroxine under-replacement in CeH patients. The clinical management of CeH is further complicated by the combination with multiple pituitary deficiencies, as the introduction of sex steroids or GH replacements may uncover latent forms of CeH or increase the thyroxine requirements."
30645008,"Estrogens demonstrate biological activity in numerous organ systems, including the immune system, and exert their effects through estrogen receptors (ER) of two types: intracellular ERα and ERβ that activate transcriptional factors and membrane G protein-coupled ER GPER. The latter is capable to mediate fast activation of cytosolic signaling pathways, influencing transcriptional events in response to estrogens. Tamoxifen (TAM), widely used in chemotherapy of ERα-positive breast cancer, is considered as an ERα antagonist and GPER agonist. TAM was shown to possess ""off-target"" cytotoxicity, not related to ER in various tumor types. The present work was designed to study biological effects of TAM on the glucocorticoid (GC)-resistant cell line Jurkat, derived from acute lymphoblastic leukemia of T lineage (T-ALL). We have shown that T-ALL cell lines, in contrast to healthy T cells, express only GPER, but not ERα or ERβ. TAM compromised mitochondrial function and reduced the viability and proliferation of Jurkat cells. Additionally, TAM induced autophagy in a GPER-dependent manner. Gene expression profiling revealed the up-regulation of autophagy-related gene ATG5. Interestingly, TAM sensitized Jurkat cells to dexamethasone (DEX) treatment, which may be related to its capacity to cause autophagy. We suggest that TAM-based adjuvant therapy may represent a novel strategy in T-ALL patients handling."
30644929,"Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-9 has been associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, methods for delivering exogenous BMP-9 genes in vivo are lacking. In this study, we developed a gene delivery system using polyethyleneimine (PEI)-based core-shell nanoparticles (PCNs) as gene delivery carriers, and investigated the effectiveness and safety for delivery of the shBMP-9 gene. PCNs possessed a well-defined core-shell nanostructure with hydrophobic polymer cores and dense PEI shells of uniform particle size and highly positively charged surfaces. In vitro evaluation suggested that PCNs had high loading capacity for exogenous genes and low cytotoxicity toward hepatocytes. The transfection efficiency of PCNs/pENTR-shBMP9 complexes was higher than that of commercial lipofectamine 2000/shBMP9. In vivo studies showed that PCNs/pENTR-shBMP9 transfection led to a significant decrease in hepatic BMP9 expression compared with pENTR-shBMP9 transfection. Under high fat diet (HFD) feeding, PCNs/pENTR-shBMP9 mice exhibited aggravated glucose and insulin tolerance. At a molecular level, PCNs/pENTR-shBMP9 mice displayed elevated PEPCK protein levels and lower levels of InsR and Akt phosphorylation than pENTR-shBMP9 mice. These results suggest that the biological effects of PCNs/pENTR-shBMP9 in vivo are much more effective than those of pENTR-shBMP9. Therefore, the polyethyleneimine (PEI)-based core-shell nanoparticle can be applied as promising nanocarriers for effective and safe gene delivery."
30644694,"Allergy poses a heavy health burden in modern society. Other than symptom-relieving medications, the only available treatment approach is allergen-specific immunotherapy, which in spite of offering a potential cure, requires a long treatment duration with multiple doses of allergen administration and carries a risk of anaphylaxis. Gene therapy has shown advantages in experimental studies for treatment of tumors, genetic diseases, chronic infections, and allergy. To date, adenovirus has been the most extensively used gene transfer vector, and offers high efficiency and safety. Here, we review studies of adenovirus-mediated gene therapy targeting different steps in the development of allergic diseases. Adenovirus-mediated gene therapy might be a promising add-on therapy for allergy treatment."
30644648,"We documented inter-individual variability in the response to acute asthma therapy in children, attributed in part to five clinical factors (oxygen saturation, asthma severity score, virus detection, fever, symptoms between exacerbations; DOORWAY study).

30644239,"The prognostic value of peripheral natural killer (pNK) cells, as a screening test in women with recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) and unexplained infertility, is still a matter for discussion. The purpose of this study was to compare the percentage of circulating CD56<sup>+</sup>NK cells, CD69 and perforin markers between women with unexplained infertility and RPL with the healthy control group."
30644168,"Simvastatin is clinically used for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. This study investigated the effects of the intra-articular administration of a simvastatin-conjugated gelatin hydrogel on osteoarthritis (OA) progression in a murine model. The medial meniscus of the knee joint was de-stabilized to induce OA in 10-week-old mice. Mice were then intra-articularly injected with dimethyl sulfoxide (control), drug-free gelatin hydrogel, simvastatin, or simvastatin-conjugated gelatin hydrogel. At 8 weeks postsurgery, OA progression was significantly attenuated in the simvastatin-conjugated gelatin hydrogel-treated mice compared with the other three groups. Attenuation of OA in mice treated with simvastatin-conjugated gelatin hydrogel was associated with decreased expression of cartilage-degrading enzymes and interleukin (IL)-1β and increased expression of type II collagen and an autophagic marker, LC3, in the articular cartilage. The effects of simvastatin on gene expression and autophagy in the mouse primary chondrocytes were also examined in the presence or absence of IL-1β. Treatment with simvastatin down-regulated Mmp-13 and Il-1β and up-regulated Col2a1 and autophagic activity. Our findings suggest that the intra-articular administration of simvastatin-conjugated gelatin hydrogel could be used as a new potential therapy for OA."

30643813,"Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by a decline of lung function and symptoms such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema leading from lung tissue destruction. Increased activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and an imbalance between MMPs and their tissue inhibitors (TIMPs) are considered as factors influencing the pathogenesis of COPD. We investigated the role of genetic polymorphism and expression level of MMP-9 and concentration of its complexes with TIMPs in the development of COPD among Polish patients. We analyzed SNP in the promoter region of <i>MMP-9</i> gene (rs3918242) using PCR-RFLP method among 335 COPD patients and 309 healthy individuals. Additionally, 60 COPD patients and 61 controls were tested for copy number variants (CNV) of <i>MMP-9</i> (by quantitative real-time PCR) and serum levels of MMP-9 and its complexes with TIMP1 and TIMP2 (using ELISA). All subjects were analyzed for lung function using spirometry (FEV<sub>1</sub>% and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC parameters). We observed that allele and genotype frequencies of the SNP rs3918242, as well as the number of gene copies, were similar in COPD patient and controls groups. Serum levels of MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP1 complex were significantly higher in COPD patients in comparison to controls groups, although independently of analyzed gene polymorphisms. Additionally, the significant inverse relationships between parameters of lung function (FEV<sub>1</sub>% and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC) and proteins level were found in ridge regression models, especially we found that FEV<sub>1</sub>% decreased when MMP-9 level increased in controls and patients with COPD group. In conclusion, we found that COPD patients were predisposed to produce more MMP-9 and MMP-9/TIMP1 complex than healthy individuals. This phenomenon is probably associated with the disease-related lung environment but not with genetic features of the <i>MMP-9</i>."
30643726,"CRISPR/dCas9 systems can precisely control endogenous gene expression without interrupting host genomic sequence and have provided a novel and feasible strategy for the treatment of cancers at the transcriptional level. However, development of CRISPR/dCas9-based anti-cancer therapeutics remains challenging due to the conflicting requirements for the design of the delivery system: a cationic and membrane-binding surface facilitates the tumor accumulation and cellular uptake of the CRISPR/dCas9 system, but hinders the circulating stability in vivo. Here, a multistage delivery nanoparticle (MDNP) that can achieve tumor-targeted delivery of CRISPR/dCas9 systems and restore endogenous microRNA (miRNA) expression in vivo is described. MDNP is designed as a core-shell structure in which the shell is made of a responsive polymer that endows MDNP with the capability to present different surface properties in response to its surrounding microenvironment, allowing the MNDP overcoming multiple physiological barriers and delivering the payload to tumor tissues with an optimal efficiency. Systemic administration of MDNP/dCas9-miR-524 to tumor-bearing mice achieved effective upregulation of miR-524 in tumors, leading to the simultaneous interferences of multiple signal pathways related to cancer cell proliferation and presenting remarkable tumor growth retardation, suggesting the feasibility of utilizing MDNP to achieve tumor-targeting delivery of CRISPR/dCas9 with sufficient levels to realize its therapeutic effects."
30643715,"Advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics have led to the prospect of precision medicine where therapeutics can be advised by the genetic background of individuals. For example, mapping cancer genomics has revealed numerous genes that affect the therapeutic outcome of a drug. Through materials and cell engineering, many opportunities exist for engineers to contribute to precision medicine, such as engineering biosensors for diagnosis and health status monitoring, developing smart formulations for the controlled release of drugs, programming immune cells for targeted cancer therapy, differentiating pluripotent stem cells into desired lineages, fabricating bioscaffolds that support cell growth, or constructing ""organs-on-chips"" that can screen the effects of drugs. Collective engineering efforts will help transform precision medicine into a more personalized and effective healthcare approach. As continuous progress is made in engineering techniques, more tools will be available to fully realize precision medicine's potential."
30643713,"The ability to remote control the expression of therapeutic genes in mammalian cells in order to treat disease is a central goal of synthetic biology-inspired therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, optogenetics, a combination of light and genetic sciences, provides an unprecedented ability to use light for precise control of various cellular activities with high spatiotemporal resolution. Recent work to combine optogenetics and therapeutic synthetic biology has led to the engineering of light-controllable designer cells, whose behavior can be regulated precisely and noninvasively. This Review focuses mainly on non-neural optogenetic systems, which are often used in synthetic biology, and their applications in genetic programing of mammalian cells. Here, a brief overview of the optogenetic tool kit that is available to build light-sensitive mammalian cells is provided. Then, recently developed strategies for the control of designer cells with specific biological functions are summarized. Recent translational applications of optogenetically engineered cells are also highlighted, ranging from in vitro basic research to in vivo light-controlled gene therapy. Finally, current bottlenecks, possible solutions, and future prospects for optogenetics in synthetic biology are discussed."
30643428,"Improvements in the last decade in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying acute myeloid leukemia (AML) have emphasized that treatment regimens should be personalized with agents that can selectively target genetic abnormalities if present. Neomorphic mutations in isoform 1 of isocitrate dehydrogenase (<i>IDH1</i>) result in the formation of the onco-metabolite <i>R</i>-2-hydroxyglutarate, which drives leukemic transformation by affecting processes such as chromatin remodeling, the cellular defense against oxidative stress and cell survival. Preclinical studies with small molecule inhibitors have validated mutant IDH1 as a molecular target, and a recent Phase 1 clinical trial with the first mutant IDH1 inhibitor ivosidenib has prompted approval by the US Food and Drug Association for the treatment of patients with <i>IDH1</i>-mutated AML in the relapsed and refractory setting due to impressive results. This approval has given a group of patients, that otherwise has a very poor prognosis and limited options, new hope, and it is to be expected that more indications for ivosidenib will follow soon. These developments highlight the potential of precision medicine in AML, with more agents currently under evaluation in clinical trials. Although the first reports have also already emerged describing acquired resistance for these mutant IDH inhibitors, combination treatment might overcome this problem, which could drastically change the treatment landscape of AML over the next few years."

30643205,"The manufacture of large quantities of high-quality DNA is a major bottleneck in the production of viral vectors for gene therapy. Touchlight Genetics has developed a proprietary abiological technology that addresses the major issues in commercial DNA supply. The technology uses 'rolling-circle' amplification to produce large quantities of concatameric DNA that is then processed to create closed linear double-stranded DNA by enzymatic digestion. This novel form of DNA, Doggybone™ DNA (dbDNA™), is structurally distinct from plasmid DNA. Here we compare lentiviral vectors production from dbDNA™ and plasmid DNA. Lentiviral vectors were administered to neonatal mice via intracerebroventricular injection. Luciferase expression was quantified in conscious mice continually by whole-body bioluminescent imaging. We observed long-term luciferase expression using dbDNA™-derived vectors, which was comparable to plasmid-derived lentivirus vectors. Here we have demonstrated that functional lentiviral vectors can be produced using the novel dbDNA™ configuration for delivery in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, this could enable lentiviral vector packaging of complex DNA sequences that have previously been incompatible with bacterial propagation systems, as dbDNA™ technology could circumvent such restrictions through its phi29-based rolling-circle amplification."
30643192,"Blood circulating cell-free DNA (ccfDNA) is a suggested biosource of valuable clinical information for cancer, meeting the need for a minimally-invasive advancement in the route of precision medicine. In this paper, we evaluated the prognostic and predictive potential of ccfDNA parameters in early and advanced breast cancer. Groups consisted of 150 and 16 breast cancer patients under adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy respectively, 34 patients with metastatic disease and 35 healthy volunteers. Direct quantification of ccfDNA in plasma revealed elevated concentrations correlated to the incidence of death, shorter PFS, and non-response to pharmacotherapy in the metastatic but not in the other groups. The methylation status of a panel of cancer-related genes chosen based on previous expression and epigenetic data (KLK10, SOX17, WNT5A, MSH2, GATA3) was assessed by quantitative methylation-specific PCR. All but the GATA3 gene was more frequently methylated in all the patient groups than in healthy individuals (all p < 0.05). The methylation of WNT5A was statistically significantly correlated to greater tumor size and poor prognosis characteristics and in advanced stage disease with shorter OS. In the metastatic group, also SOX17 methylation was significantly correlated to the incidence of death, shorter PFS, and OS. KLK10 methylation was significantly correlated to unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics and relapse, whereas in the adjuvant group to shorter DFI. Methylation of at least 3 or 4 genes was significantly correlated to shorter OS and no pharmacotherapy response, respectively. Classification analysis by a fully automated, machine learning software produced a single-parametric linear model using ccfDNA plasma concentration values, with great discriminating power to predict response to chemotherapy (AUC 0.803, 95% CI [0.606, 1.000]) in the metastatic group. Two more multi-parametric signatures were produced for the metastatic group, predicting survival and disease outcome. Finally, a multiple logistic regression model was constructed, discriminating between patient groups and healthy individuals. Overall, ccfDNA emerged as a highly potent predictive classifier in metastatic breast cancer. Upon prospective clinical evaluation, all the signatures produced could aid accurate prognosis."
30643048,"To explore the clinical features, pathological features, gene test results, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome(PJS).  Methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 46 hospitalized cases of PJS during 2007 and 2017.  Results: All 46 patients had mucocutaneous melanin pigmentation and multiple gastrointestinal polyposis. The pigmentation was first noticed often within 5 years old, and 14 cases had family history. The clinical manifestations mainly included black spots, abdominal pain, hematochezia, and anemia. Histological examinations showed that 20 patients were classified as hamartomatous polyps,18 as adenomatous polyps, 14 as inflammatory polyps, and 10 as zigzag polyps. Eleven patients sequenced a panel of 20 genes previously associated with colorectal cancer (CRC) by next-generation sequencing, and the results showed 5 patients with gene mutations, and 3 of them with intussusception and surgical histories were found to have pathogenic germline mutations in the STK11 gene. Endoscopic treatment was the main therapy, but endoscopy combined with laparoscopy or surgical treatment was performed when complications occurred or the polyp was too large. Malignant tumors were found in 3 patients during follow-up.  Conclusion: PJS is a hereditary disease which is characterized by spots of the skin or mucosa and gastrointestinal multiple polyps. The main pathological features are hamartoma and adenoma. The risks for intussusception and surgical operation are found to be high in the patients with pathogenic germline mutations in the STK11 gene. Endoscopic treatment is the main therapy. PJS patients should be followed up regularly due to the increasing risk for cancer and being easily to relapse."
30643018,"Adult neurogenesis is involved in cognitive performance but studies that manipulated this process to improve brain function are scarce. Here, we characterized a genetic mouse model in which neural stem cells (NSC) of the subventricular zone (SVZ) were temporarily expanded by conditional expression of the cell cycle regulators Cdk4/cyclinD1, thus increasing neurogenesis. We found that supernumerary neurons matured and integrated in the olfactory bulb similarly to physiologically generated newborn neurons displaying a correct expression of molecular markers, morphology and electrophysiological activity. Olfactory performance upon increased neurogenesis was unchanged when mice were tested on relatively easy tasks using distinct odor stimuli. In contrast, intriguingly, increasing neurogenesis improved the discrimination ability of mice when challenged with a difficult task using mixtures of highly similar odorants. Together, our study provides a mammalian model to control the expansion of somatic stem cells that can in principle be applied to any tissue for basic research and models of therapy. By applying this to NSC of the SVZ, we highlighted the importance of adult neurogenesis to specifically improve performance in a challenging olfactory task."
30643005,"Inhibitor of growth 4 (ING4), a member of the ING family discovered in 2003, has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor and is frequently down-regulated in various human cancers. Numerous published <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> studies have shown that ING4 is responsible for important cancer hallmarks such as pathologic cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, autophagy, contact inhibition, and hypoxic adaptation, and also affects tumor angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. These characteristics are typically associated with regulation through chromatin acetylation by binding histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) and through transcriptional activity of transcription factor P53 and NF-κB. In addition, emerging evidence has indicated that abnormalities in ING4 expression and function play key roles in non-neoplastic disorders. Here, we provide an overview of ING4-modulated chromosome remodeling and transcriptional function, as well as the functional consequences of different genetic variants. We also present the current understanding concerning the role of ING4 in the development of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases. These studies offer inspiration for pursuing novel therapeutics for various cancers."
30642980,"Recurrent mutational activation of the MAP kinase pathway in plasma cell myeloma implicates growth factor-like signaling responses in the biology of Ab-secreting cells (ASCs). Physiological ASCs survive in niche microenvironments, but how niche signals are propagated and integrated is poorly understood. In this study, we dissect such a response in human ASCs using an in vitro model. Applying time course expression data and parsimonious gene correlation network analysis (PGCNA), a new approach established by our group, we map expression changes that occur during the maturation of proliferating plasmablast to quiescent plasma cell under survival conditions including the potential niche signal TGF-β3. This analysis demonstrates a convergent pattern of differentiation, linking unfolded protein response/endoplasmic reticulum stress to secretory optimization, coordinated with cell cycle exit. TGF-β3 supports ASC survival while having a limited effect on gene expression including upregulation of CXCR4. This is associated with a significant shift in response to SDF1 in ASCs with amplified ERK1/2 activation, growth factor-like immediate early gene regulation and EGR1 protein expression. Similarly, ASCs responding to survival conditions initially induce partially overlapping sets of immediate early genes without sustaining the response. Thus, in human ASCs growth factor-like gene regulation is transiently imposed by niche signals but is not sustained during subsequent survival and maturation."
30642945,"Axonal degeneration (AxD) following nerve injury, chemotherapy, and in several neurological disorders is an active process driven by SARM1, an injury-activated NADase. Axons of SARM1-null mice exhibit greatly delayed AxD after transection and in models of neurological disease, suggesting that inhibiting SARM1 is a promising strategy to reduce pathological AxD. Unfortunately, no drugs exist to target SARM1. We, therefore, developed SARM1 dominant-negatives that potently block AxD in cellular models of axotomy and neuropathy. To assess efficacy in vivo, we used adeno-associated virus-mediated expression of the most potent SARM1 dominant-negative and nerve transection as a model of severe AxD. While axons of vehicle-treated mice degenerate rapidly, axons of mice expressing SARM1 dominant-negative can remain intact for >10 d after transection, similar to the protection observed in SARM1-null mice. We thus developed a novel in vivo gene therapeutic to block pathological axon degeneration by inhibiting SARM1, an approach that may be applied clinically to treat manifold neurodegenerative diseases characterized by axon loss."
30642934,"The spread of multidrug or extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria is a serious public health issue. There are too few new antibiotics in development to combat the threat of multidrug-resistant infections, and consequently the rate of increasing antibiotic resistance is outpacing the drug development process. This fundamentally threatens our ability to treat common infectious diseases. Fosfomycin (FOM) has an established track record of safety in humans and is highly active against <i>Escherichia coli</i>, including multidrug-resistant strains. However, many other Gram-negative pathogens, including the ""priority pathogens"" <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> and <i>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</i>, are inherently resistant to FOM due to the chromosomally-encoded <i>fosA</i> gene, which directs expression of a metal-dependent glutathione S-transferase (FosA) that metabolizes FOM. In this study, we describe the discovery and biochemical and structural characterization of 3-bromo-6-[3-(3-bromo-2-oxo-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-6-yl)-4-nitro-1H-pyrazol-5-yl]-1H-pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidin-2-one (ANY1), a small molecule active site inhibitor of FosA. Importantly, ANY1 potentiates FOM activity in representative Gram-negative pathogens. Collectively, our study outlines a new strategy to expand FOM activity to a broader spectrum of Gram-negative pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains."
30642871,"One of the main complications associated to obesity is insulin resistance and an altered glucose and lipid metabolism within the liver. It has been previously described that insulin receptor isoform A (IRA) favors glucose uptake and glycogen storage in hepatocytes as compared to isoform B (IRB) improving glucose homeostasis in mice lacking liver insulin receptor. Thus, we hypothesized that IRA could also improve glucose and lipid metabolism in a mouse model of high fat diet-induced obesity. We addressed the role of insulin receptor isoforms on glucose and lipid metabolism <i>in vivo</i> We expressed IRA or IRB specifically in the liver by using adeno-associated viruses (AAV) in a mouse model of diet-induced insulin resistance and obesity. IRA expression, but not IRB, induced an increased glucose uptake in the liver and muscle improving insulin tolerance. Regarding lipid metabolism, we found that AAV-mediated IRA expression also ameliorated hepatic steatosis by decreasing the expression of <i>Fasn</i>, <i>Pgc1a</i>, <i>Acaca</i> and <i>Dgat2</i> and increasing <i>Scd-1</i> Taking together, our results further unravel the role of insulin receptor isoforms in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism in an insulin-resistant scenario. Our data strongly suggest that IRA is more efficient than IRB favoring hepatic glucose uptake, improving insulin tolerance and ameliorating hepatic steatosis. Therefore, we conclude that a gene therapy approach for hepatic IRA expression could be a safe and promising tool for the regulation of hepatic glucose consumption and lipid metabolism, two key processes in the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated to obesity."
30642810,"Advanced prostate cancer patients can present with both widely metastatic or oligometastatic disease. Accumulating clinical evidence suggests that patients with oligometastatic disease have improved clinical responses from metastasis-directed therapy. This suggests that tumours that give rise to the oligometastatic state are distinct biologically and genetically from those that induce widely metastatic lesions. Detailed genomic analysis of the oligometastatic state will identify the molecular events that distinguish localised from metastatic disease, defining the molecular signatures of curability. The GAP6 consortium is well poised to address this question. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this report, we have reviewed the evidence that prostate cancer patients with only a small number of distant tumour deposits have cancers that are driven by genetic and biological changes, which are distinct from those tumours that readily spread to many distant sites. So far, the evidence is not clear cut; however, in-depth studies to answer this question are underway."
30642802,"Microbubble-mediated sonoporation is a promising strategy for intracellular gene/drug delivery, but the biophysical mechanisms involved in the interactions between microbubbles and cells are not well understood. Here, HeLa cells were synchronized in individual cycle phases, then the cell-cycle-dependences of the membrane permeability and viability of HeLa cells undergoing multi-bubble sonoporation were evaluated using focused ultrasound exposure apparatus coupled passive cavitation detection system. The results indicated that: (1) the microbubble cavitation activity should be independent on cell cycle phases; (2) G<sub>1</sub>-phase cells with the largest Young's modulus were the most robust against microbubble-mediated sonoporation; (3) G<sub>2</sub>/M-phase cells exhibited the greatest accumulated FITC uptake with the lowest viability, which should be mainly attributed to the chemical effect of synchronization drugs; and (4) more important, S-phase cells with the lowest stiffness seemed to be the most susceptible to the mechanical effect generated by microbubble cavitation activity, which resulted in the greatest enhancement in sonoporation-facilitated membrane permeabilization without further scarifying their viability. The current findings may benefit ongoing efforts aiming to pursue rational utilization of microbubble-mediated sonoporation in cell-cycle-targeted gene/drug delivery for cancer therapy."
30642603,"Canine atopic dermatitis is a genetically predisposed inflammatory and pruritic allergic skin disease that is often complicated by (secondary) bacterial and fungal (yeast) infections. High-throughput DNA sequencing was used to characterize the composition of the microbiome (bacteria and fungi) inhabiting specific sites of skin in healthy dogs and dogs with atopic dermatitis (AD) before and after topical antimicrobial treatment. Skin microbiome samples were collected from six healthy control dogs and three dogs spontaneously affected by AD by swabbing at (non-) predilection sites before, during and after treatment. Bacteria and fungi were profiled by Illumina sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene of bacteria (16S) and the internally transcribed spacer of the ribosomal gene cassette in fungi (ITS). The total cohort of dogs showed a high diversity of microbes on skin with a strong individual variability of both 16S and ITS profiles. The genera of Staphylococcus and Porphyromonas were dominantly present both on atopic and healthy skin and across all skin sites studied. In addition, bacterial and fungal alpha diversity were similar at the different skin sites. The topical antimicrobial treatment increased the diversity of bacterial and fungal compositions in course of time on both AD and healthy skin."

In this era of cancer immunotherapy, humanized mouse models which recapitulate human immune system, are needed for predicting immunotherapy response in patients. We established a Hu-PBL-NSG mouse model which can be used as a preclinical testing platform for assessing efficacy of different immunotherapeutic agents."
30642188,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are widely used in stem cell therapy for regenerative purposes. Oral-derived MSCs, such as gingival MSCs (GMSCs), deriving from the neural crest seem more suitable to differentiate toward the neuronal lineage. In addition, the preconditioning of MSCs may improve their beneficial effects. Since it is known that hypoxia may influence stem cell properties, we were interested in evaluating the effects of hypoxia preconditioning on the neuronal differentiation of GMSCs. With this aim, we evaluated the transcriptional profile of GMSCs exposed to basal and neuroinductive medium both in normoxia and in cells preconditioned for 48 h in hypoxia. We compared their transcriptional profile using Next Generation Sequencing. At first we observed that hypoxia did not alter cell morphology compared with the GMSCs cultured in a normoxic condition. In order to understand hypoxia preconditioning effects on neuronal differentiation, we screened genes with Log2 fold change ≥2 using the database Cortecon, that collects gene expression data set of in vitro corticogenesis. We observed that hypoxia preconditioning induced the expression of more genes associated with different stages of cortical development. The common genes, expressed both in normoxia and hypoxia preconditioning, were involved in developmental and neuronal processes. Interestingly, a larger number of genes associated with development biology and neuronal process was expressed in GMSCs differentiated after hypoxia preconditioning compared with those in normoxia. In addition, hypoxic-preconditioned differentiated GMSCs showed a higher expression of nestin, PAX6, and GAP43. Our data demonstrated that hypoxia preconditioning enhanced the differentiation potential of GMSCs and induced the activation of a higher number of genes associated with neuronal development. In conclusion, hypoxia may be used to improve MSCs' properties for stem cell therapy."
30642104,"The field of nanotechnology, through which nanomaterials are designed, characterized, produced, and applied, is rapidly emerging in various fields, including energy, electronics, food and agriculture, environmental science, cosmetics, and medicine. The most common biomedical applications of nanomaterials involve drug delivery, bioimaging, and gene and cancer therapy. Since they possess unique properties which are different than bulk materials, toxic effects and long-term impacts on organisms are not completely known. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to emphasize the main neurotoxic effects induced by nanoparticles, liposomes, dendrimers, carbon nanotubes, and quantum dots, as well as the key neurotoxicology assays to evaluate them."
30641980,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited monogenic disorder, amenable to gene-based therapies. Because CF lung disease is currently the major cause of mortality and morbidity, and the lung airway is readily accessible to gene delivery, the major CF gene therapy effort at present is directed to the lung. Although airway epithelial cells are renewed slowly, permanent gene correction through gene editing or targeting in airway stem cells is needed to perpetuate the therapeutic effect. Transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) has been utilized widely for a variety of gene editing applications. The stringent requirement for nuclease binding target sites allows for gene editing with precision. In this study, we engineered helper-dependent adenoviral (HD-Ad) vectors to deliver a pair of TALENs together with donor DNA targeting the human AAVS1 locus. With homology arms of 4 kb in length, we demonstrated precise insertion of either a <i>LacZ</i> reporter gene or a human cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (<i>CFTR</i>) minigene (cDNA) into the target site. Using the LacZ reporter, we determined the efficiency of gene integration to be about 5%. In the CFTR vector transduced cells, we were able to detect CFTR mRNA expression using qPCR and function correction using fluorometric image plate reader (FLIPR) and iodide efflux assays. Taken together, these findings suggest a new direction for future in vitro and in vivo studies in CF gene editing."
30641727,"Type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus is a serious and lifelong condition commonly characterised by abnormally elevated blood glucose levels due to a failure in insulin production or a decrease in insulin sensitivity and function. Over the years, prevalence of diabetes has increased globally and it is classified as one of the leading cause of high mortality and morbidity rate. Furthermore, diabetes confers a huge economic burden due to its management costs as well as its complications are skyrocketing. The conventional medications in diabetes treatment focusing on insulin secretion and insulin sensitisation cause unwanted side effects to patients and lead to incompliance as well as treatment failure. Besides insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents, other treatments such as gene therapy and induced β-cells regeneration have not been widely introduced to manage diabetes. Therefore, this review aims to deliver an overview of the current conventional medications in diabetes, discovery of newer pharmacological drugs and gene therapy as a potential intervention of diabetes in the future."
30641598,"Chronic pain and especially back pain rank among the most meaningful medical conditions worldwide. This leads to extensive costs in medical care systems. In about 80-85% of cases there is no morphologic evidence for a possible pain etiology, hence such forms are called ""non-specific back pain"". Therapies with a pure focus on symptomatic aspects are not effective to treat non-specific pain. The origin of chronic back pain can be best explained via a multi causal mechanism with a combination of bio-psycho-social, biographical, neurobiological, genetic, and cognitive factors. Since various aspects of the pain genesis have to be considered, multidisciplinary treatment shows much better results."
30641517,"The term hypoparathyroidism encompasses a huge group of disorders all characterized by an abnormal mineral homeostasis determined by inadequate secretion of parathyroid hormone. Postsurgical hypoparathyroidism is a complication of neck surgery (thyroidectomy, parathyroidectomy, lymph node, and cancer neck dissection), closely related to the extent of the surgical procedure and the experience of the surgeon. If lasting more than 6 months it is defined as chronic hypoparathyroidism, requiring life-long replacement therapy with active vitamin D metabolites. All the other forms of nonsurgical hypoparathyroidism, previously referred to as idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, have several causes, the majority of them genetic, which can be grouped into 3 main categories: disorder of parathyroid development, disorders of parathyroid function, and acquired damage to the parathyroids. Hypoparathyroidism can manifest as the sole disease in an individual (isolated hypoparathyroidism) or be associated with other manifestations within complex syndromes (syndromic hypoparathyroidism). Functional hypoparathyroidism, which may be caused by magnesium disturbances, has always to be ruled out before commencing the genetic diagnostic workup in nonsurgical forms. The search for signs of autoimmunity can drive the diagnosis towards an autoimmune pathogenesis of the disease, since a routine assessment of parathyroid autoantibodies is neither available nor specific."

30641124,"Global market of herbs has been struggling with food adulteration issues. A number of assays have been developed to aid the detection of the tampered samples and ensure high quality of the marketed products. However, herbs are marketed not only for their culinary applications but also as remedies due to high levels of biologically active constituents. Nevertheless, there is no information in the literature about the influence of herbs adulteration on the biological activity of the final product. Current study aims at assessing the influence of oregano adulteration on its in-vitro estrogen-like activity. High responses in a mammalian reporter gene assay have been detected in pure and adulterated samples, translating to 21-7409 ng of 17β-estradiol equivalents per gram of oregano. The origin of those responses was assessed by combining fractionation and UHPLC-HRMS. Three flavones were proposed as the most active extract constituents i.e. luteolin-glucoside, luteolin- and apigenin-glucuronides all of which have been previously identified in other herbal extracts with estrogenic activity. This study underlines challenges of biological activity assessment in complex herbal extracts as well as the need for further assessment of such supplement administrations in the case of postmenopausal women and breast cancer patients undergoing hormone therapy."

Subsequent studies revealed that RLX possesses anti-fibrotic functions in tumors and nonreproductive tissues, such as skin, lungs, and others. This aspect of the RLX has been explored for the treatment of various illnesses, such as cardiac fibrosis, liver fibrosis, and solid tumors. With gene therapy coming into age with increasing number of products being approved by regulatory bodies in Europe and United States, we aim to discuss how RLX have been utilized in scope of gene therapy for treatment of various illnesses."
30641084,"Leishmaniasis is considered a serious public health problem and the current available therapy has several disadvantages, which makes the search for new therapeutic targets and alternative treatments extremely necessary. In this context, this review focuses on the importance of parasite proteases as target drugs against Leishmania parasites, as a chemotherapy approach. Initially, we discuss about the current scenario for the treatment of leishmaniasis, highlighting the main drugs used and the problems related to their use. Subsequently, we describe the inhibitors of major proteases of Leishmania already discovered, such as Compound s9 (aziridine-2,3-dicarboxylate), Compound 1c (benzophenone derivative), Au2Phen (gold complex), AubipyC (gold complex), MDL 28170 (dipeptidyl aldehyde), K11777, Hirudin, diazo-acetyl norleucine methyl ester, Nelfinavir, Saquinavir, Nelfinavir, Saquinavir, Indinavir, Saquinavir, GNF5343 (azabenzoxazole), GNF6702 (azabenzoxazole), Benzamidine and TPCK. Next, we discuss the importance of the protease gene to parasite survival and the aspects of the validation of proteases as target drugs, with emphasis on gene disruption. Then, we describe novel important strategies that can be used to support the research of new antiparasitic drugs, such as molecular modeling and nanotechnology, whose main targets are parasitic proteases. And finally, we discuss possible perspectives to improve drug development. Based on all findings, proteases could be considered potential targets against leishmaniasis."
30641060,"Mammary serine protease inhibitor or Maspin has been characterized as a class II tumor suppressor gene in several cancer types, among them prostate cancer (CaP). Androgen ablation is an effective therapy for CaP, but with short-term effectiveness, thus new therapeutic strategies are actively sought. The present study is aimed to explore the effects of a glucosamine derivative, 2-(N-Carbobenzyloxy)l-phenylalanylamido-2-deoxy-β-d-glucose (NCPA), on two CaP cell lines, PC3 and LNCaP. In particular we analyzed the impact of NCPA on Maspin production, cell viability and cell cycle progression and apoptosis/necrosis pathway activation in PC3 and LNCaP cell lines. NCPA is able to stimulate Maspin production in PC3 and not in LNCaP cell lines. NCPA blocks the PC3 cell cycle in G1 phase, by inhibiting Cyclin D1 production and induces the apoptosis, therefore interfering with aggressiveness of this androgen-insensitive cell line. Moreover, NCPA is able to induce the expression of Maspin in LNCaP cell line treated with androgen receptor inhibitor, Bicalutamide, and in turn to stimulate the apoptosis of these cells. These findings suggest that NCPA, stimulating the endogenous production of a tumor suppressor protein, could be useful in the design of new therapeutic strategies for treatment of CaP."
30640902,"The Rab family of small GTPases regulate various aspects of cellular dynamics in eukaryotic cells. Membrane trafficking has emerged as central to the functions of leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), which is associated with inherited and sporadic forms of Parkinson's disease (PD). Rabs act as both regulators of the catalytic activity and targets for serine/threonine phosphorylation by LRRK2. Rab32, Rab38 and Rab29 have been shown to regulate LRRK2 sub-cellular localization through direct interactions. Recently, Rab29 was shown to escort LRRK2 to the Golgi apparatus and activate the phosphorylation of Rab8 and Rab10. Rab32 is linked to multiple cellular functions including endosomal trafficking, mitochondrial dynamics, and melanosome biogenesis. A missense mutation in Rab32 has also recently been linked to PD. Here, we demonstrate that Rab32 directly interacts with sorting nexin 6 (SNX6). SNX6 is a transient subunit of the retromer, an endosome-Golgi retrieval complex whose Vps35 subunit is strongly associated with PD. We could further show that localization of cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptors, which are recycled to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) by the retromer, was affected by both Rab32 and SNX6. These data imply that Rab32 is linked to SNX6/retromer trafficking at the Golgi, and also suggests a possible connection between the retromer and Rab32 in the trafficking and biological functions of LRRK2."

It is characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors in the central nervous system. A majority of these tumors can be treated with surgery or radiotherapy in the case of the symptomatic disease. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has no established role in the treatment of NF-2. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical mediator of tumor angiogenesis and vessel permeability. VEGF and its receptor VEGFR-1 have been detected in schwannomas, and increased levels of these factors correlate with increased rates of tumor growth. The use of bevacizumab has made many progresses in recent years in NF-2 patients. We report a case of a young patient treated with more than 100 administration of bevacizumab, with clinical and instrumental benefits."

30640563,"In the era of personalized cancer therapy, the sampling of adequate tumor tissue for histologic diagnosis and genomic profiling is crucial, not only at the initial diagnosis but also in the event of resistant and recurrent disease when sequential biopsies may be required to evaluate somatic mutations and histologic changes. Areas covered: The identification of genetic driver alterations led to the selection of patients who are most likely to benefit from epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and rat osteosarcoma (ROS-1) tyrosine kinase inhibitors; on the other hand, in the absence of oncogenic alterations, platinum-based doublet chemotherapy regimens were the cornerstone of treatment. However, the advent of immunotherapy has widely changed the first-line treatment. Expert commentary: An Italian Experts Panel Meeting was held to discuss on recommendations for diagnosis (optimization of the cyto/histologic tumor sample issue and management of tissue to molecular evaluation) and immunotherapy as first-line treatment of patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer."
30640437,"The CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas system is an adaptive immune system of bacteria that has furnished several RNA-guided DNA endonucleases (e.g., Cas9) that are revolutionizing the field of genome engineering. Cas9 is being used to effect genomic alterations as well as in gene drives, where a particular trait may be propagated through a targeted species population over several generations. The ease of targeting catalytically impaired Cas9 to any genomic loci has led to development of technologies for base editing, chromatin imaging and modeling, epigenetic editing, and gene regulation. Unsurprisingly, Cas9 is being developed for numerous applications in biotechnology and biomedical research and as a gene therapy agent for multiple pathologies. There is a need for precise control of Cas9 activity over several dimensions, including those of dose, time, and space in these applications. Such precision controls, which are required of therapeutic agents, are particularly important for Cas9 as off-target effects, chromosomal translocations, immunogenic response, genotoxicity, and embryonic mosaicism are observed at elevated levels and with prolonged activity of Cas9. Here, we provide a perspective on advances in the precision control of Cas9 over aforementioned dimensions using external stimuli (e.g., small molecules or light) for controlled activation, inhibition, or degradation of Cas9."
30639966,"Lung epithelial cells and fibroblasts are key cell populations in lung development. Fibroblasts support type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2) in the developing and mature lung. However, fibroblast-AEC2 interactions have not been clearly described. We addressed this in the present study by time course serial analysis of gene expression sequencing (SAGE-seq) of epithelial cells and fibroblasts of developing and mature murine lungs. We identified lung fibroblast-epithelial interactions that potentially regulate alveologenesis and are mediated by fibroblast-expressed ligands and epithelial cell surface receptors. In the epithelial-fibroblast co-culture alveolosphere formation assay, single intervention against fibroblast-expressed ligand or associated signaling cascades promoted or inhibited alveolosphere growth. Adding the ligand-associated molecules fibroblast growth factor 7 and Notch ligand and inhibitors of bone morphogenetic protein 4, transforming growth factor β, and glycogen synthase kinase-3β to the culture medium enabled fibroblast-free alveolosphere formation. The results revealed the essential factors regulating fibroblast-AEC2 interactions."
30639929,"The discovery of chromosomes, genes, and DNA in the early 20th century paved the way for the development of techniques to examine the role of these elements in disease pathogenesis. Since the start of the 21st century, genetic testing and particularly next-generation sequencing has allowed for a rapid rate of gene disease associations for a broad range of primary immunodeficiency patients. At the same time, biologic and small molecule-based therapies targeting specific molecular pathways have been developed and are being applied clinically and in research settings to treat genetically defined immunodeficiencies. In recent years, both the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology and the Clinical Immunology Society have recommended the use of genetic testing for diagnosis, therapy guidance, and genetic counseling in patients with clinical symptoms of primary immunodeficiency."
30639691,"Lung cancer is the foremost reason of death from cancers with broad genetic and epigenetic diversity. Various strategies are clinically available for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. However, in many cases, the disease is diagnosed after malignancy that reduce the survival rate of lung cancer patients due to unsuccessful response to therapy. With the help of nanotechnology, various nanoparticulate systems including organic, inorganic, metallic, and polymeric nanoparticles have been developed for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer. Each of these nanocarriers possess their own advantages and disadvantages. Combining the organic and inorganic components in a single hybrid nanosystem prepares a new generation of multifunctional nanoparticles with enhanced structural and biological properties. Such nanoparticles not only have beneficial features of all the bulk materials, but also can be tuned in terms of structural and functional moieties to provide carriers with improved diagnostic and therapeutic outcomes. Indeed, hybrid nanoparticles with the ability to incorporate multiple drugs, targeting agents, and photosensitive reagents opened new insights into developing more sensitive and specified systems for diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer compared with conventional nanocarriers. In this review, recent developments in designing different hybrid nanoparticles with diagnostic, therapeutic, and theranostic properties for lung cancer are explained in detail."
30639639,"Chronic autoimmune atrophic gastritis (CAAG) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease, which affects the corpus-fundus gastric mucosa. Although it has been described for several years, the real pathophysiological mechanisms, the natural history and the possible neoplastic complications are not completely known. Atrophy of the gastric mucosa is the endpoint of the chronic processes, with the loss of glandular cells and their replacement by intestinal-type epithelium, pyloric-type glands, and fibrous tissue. As a consequence, hydrochloric acid, pepsin and intrinsic-factor is impaired resulting in pernicious anemia. The exact causal agent is not yet known, but both genetic and environmental factors seem to play a decisive role. Moreover, the clinical onset may assume different characteristics; differently from what previously observed, recent evidence has reported the onset of CAAG at a younger age, frequently with iron deficiency anemia or upper gastro-intestinal symptoms. The diagnosis of CAAG might be challenging and usually requires the combination of clinical, serological and histopathologic data; moreover, CAAG patients are often misdiagnosed as refractory to HP eradication therapy, probably because achlorhydria might allow urease-positive bacteria other than H pylori to colonize the stomach, causing positive <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test results. However, biopsy is the most reliable method to evaluate the presence of metaplastic atrophic gastritis. In order to assess the severity of gastric atrophy and intestinal metaplasia, OLGA and OLGIM staging systems have been proposed and seem to correlate with the risk of developing gastric adenocarcinoma. Indeed, CAAG represents a pre-neoplastic condition, as patients with CAAG are very likely to develop either type-1 gastric neuroendocrine tumors and gastric adenocarcinomas, as well as several other neoplastic diseases. To date, the need, the intervals and cost-effectiveness of endoscopic/histological surveillance for patients with CAAG/pernicious anemia are yet to be established."
30639616,"Transient receptor potential protein (TRP) ion channels TRPA1 and TRPV1 may be important in mediating airway tissue injury and inflammation. This study was designed to clarify the role of TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels in cigarette smoke extract (CSE)-induced damage to bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells. Alveolar epithelial (A549) cells and bronchial epithelial (Beas-2B) cells were treated with CSE in the presence and absence of a TRPA1 inhibitor (100 μM, A967079), a TRPV1 inhibitor (100 μM, AMG9810) or both. DCFH-DA and MitoSOX Red probes were used to assay intracellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress, respectively. The mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators (IL-1β, IL-8, IL-18, IL-33) and antioxidants (HO-1, NQO1, MnSOD, catalase) and the protein expression levels of mitochondrial and inflammasome factors (MFN2, OPA1, DRP1, MFF, NLRP3,caspase-1) were respectively detected by RT-PCR and Western Blot. The results were validated in TRPA1 shRNA and TRPV1 shRNA cells. In both cell types, 10% CSE increased intracellular and mitochondrial oxidative stress, induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, increased inflammatory gene expression, reduced antioxidant gene expression and inhibited the activities of mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes. 10% CSE increased the expression of mitochondrial fission proteins (MFF and DRP1), Caspase-1 and NLRP3 protein expression and decreased that of mitochondrial fusion proteins (MFN2 and OPA1). Both inhibitors and gene-knockout of TRPA1 and TRPV1 reduced oxidative stress, blocked Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, and inhibited inflammatory and increased antioxidant gene expression. They also prevented the changes in mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins and in MRC complexes activities induced by CSE. Both TRPA1 and TRPV1 mediate CSE-induced damage of bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells via modulation of oxidative stress, inflammation and mitochondrial damage and their inhibition should be considered as potential therapy for COPD."
30639441,"Accumulating evidence has shown that altered expression of microRNA-532-5p (miR-532-5p) is involved in the development and progression of various cancers. However, little is known about the role of miR-532-5p in bladder cancer. In this study, we aimed to investigate the expression, biological function, and regulatory mechanism of miR-532-5p in bladder cancer. Herein, we found that miR-532-5p expression was frequently downregulated in bladder cancer tissues and cell lines compared with normal controls. Functional experiments showed that overexpression of miR-532-5p inhibited the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells, whereas inhibition of miR-532-5p showed opposite effects. Interestingly, bioinformatics analysis predicted high-mobility group protein B3 (HMGB3) as a potential target gene of miR-532-5p. Further experiments showed that miR-532-5p directly targeted the 3'-UTR of HMGB3 and negatively regulated its expression in bladder cancer cells. Moreover, HMGB3 expression was upregulated in bladder cancer tissues and showed inverse correlation with miR-532-5p expression. Notably, miR-532-5p regulated the nuclear expression of β-catenin and activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in bladder cancer cells. However, restoration of HMGB3 expression partially reversed the antitumor effect of miR-532-5p overexpression, while knockdown of HMGB3 partially abrogated the oncogenic effect of miR-532-5p inhibition. Taken together, our results demonstrated that miR-532-5p inhibited the proliferation and invasion of bladder cancer cells by targeting HMGB3 and downregulating Wnt/β-catenin signaling, suggesting a tumor suppressive role of miR-532-5p in bladder cancer. Our study highlights an importance of the miR-532-5p/HMGB3 axis in bladder cancer and suggests that targeting miR-532-5p/HMGB3 may have potential applications for development of bladder cancer therapy."
30639429,"Loss-of-function mutations in the ABCC6 gene cause pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) and type 2 generalized arterial calcification of infancy (GACI), heritable ectopic mineralization disorders without effective treatment. ABCC6 encodes the putative efflux transporter ABCC6 which is predominantly expressed in the liver. While the substrate of ABCC6 remains unknown, recent studies demonstrated that PXE is a metabolic disorder caused by reduced circulating levels of pyrophosphate (PPi), a potent mineralization inhibitor. Here, we hypothesized that reconstitution of ABCC6 might counteract ectopic mineralization in an Abcc6<sup>-/-</sup> mouse model of PXE. Intravenous administration of a recombinant adenovirus expressing wild type human ABCC6 in Abcc6<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed sustained high-level expression of human ABCC6 in the liver for up to 4 weeks, increasing PPi levels in plasma. In addition, adenovirus injection every 4 weeks restored plasma PPi levels, and consequently, significantly reduced ectopic mineralization in the skin of young mice. By contrast, the same treatment in old mice with already established mineral deposits failed to reduce mineralization. These results suggest that adenovirus-mediated ABCC6 gene delivery, when initiated early, is a promising prevention therapy for PXE and GACI, diseases that currently lack preventive or therapeutic options."
30639386,"Cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) treatment is a plausible strategy for enhanced cancer therapy. Here we report a glucose-installed sub-50-nm nanocarrier for the targeted delivery of small interfering RNA (siRNA) to CSCs through selective recognition of the glucose ligand to the glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) overexpressed on the CSC surface. The siRNA nanocarrier was constructed via a two-step assembling process. First, a glucose-installed poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(l-lysine) modified with lipoic acid (LA) at the ω-end (Glu-PEG-PLL-LA) was associated with a single siRNA to form a unimer polyion complex (uPIC). Second, a 20 nm gold nanoparticle (AuNP) was decorated with ~65 uPICs through AuS bonding. The glucose-installed targeted nanoparticles (Glu-NPs) exhibited higher cellular uptake of siRNA payloads in a spheroid breast cancer (MBA-MB-231) cell culture compared with glucose-unconjugated control nanoparticles (MeO-NPs). Notably, the Glu-NPs became more efficiently internalized into the CSC fraction, which was defined by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity assay, than the other fractions, probably due to the higher GLUT1 expression level on the CSCs. The Glu-NPs elicited significantly enhanced gene silencing in a CSC-rich orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumor tissue following systemic administration to tumor-bearing mice. Ultimately, the repeated administrations of polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) siRNA-loaded Glu-NPs significantly suppressed the growth of orthotopic MDA-MB-231 tumors. These results demonstrate that Glu-NP is a promising nanocarrier design for CSC-targeted cancer treatment."
30639339,"The generation of dopaminergic neurons from stem cells is a potential therapeutic approach to treat neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's disease. The current study aims to investigate the potential of two different types of mesenchymal stem cells derived from human Wharton's jelly and nasal cavity for differentiation into dopaminergic neurons. The differentiation capacities of both cell types were evaluated using real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry and HPLC. Wharton's jelly-derived mesenchymal stem cells (WJ-MSCs) are noted for their capability to differentiate into mesodermal and non-mesodermal cells, including neurons. However, it was demonstrated that having the same neuroectodermal origin as the nervous system, the olfactory ectomesenchymal stem cells (OE-MSCs) expressed the neural marker MAP2 as well as dopaminergic markers such as tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), dopamine transporter (DAT) and PITX3 to a greater extent than the WJ-MSCs both at the level of mRNA and protein. Furthermore, quantitative flow cytometric evaluation of these markers at 12 days post-induction supported the above-mentioned results. Finally, the assessment of the functionality of differentiated cells and their ability to synthesize dopamine measured by HPLC revealed that the OE-MSC-derived dopaminergic cells released almost the same amount of dopamine as that secreted by WJ-MSC-derived cells. Thus it showed the difference in their functionality to be negligible. Overall, it may be concluded that higher proliferation and differentiation capacity of OE-MSCs, along with their easier harvestability and autologous transplantability compared with WJ-MSCs, makes them a better cell source for stem cell therapy of neurodegenerative disorders which are caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons."
30639261,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is among the most common and malignant types of primary brain tumors in adults, with a dismal prognosis. Although alkylating agents such as temozolomide are widely applied as the first-line treatment for GBM, they often cause chemoresistance and remain ineffective with recurrent GBM. Alternative therapeutics against GBM are urgently needed in the clinic. We report herein the discovery of a class of inhibitors (YZ129 and its derivatives) of the calcineurin-NFAT pathway that exhibited potent anti-tumor activity against GBM. YZ129-induced GBM cell-cycle arrest at the G2/M phase promoted apoptosis and inhibited tumor cell proliferation and migration. At the molecular level, YZ129 directly engaged HSP90 to antagonize its chaperoning effect on calcineurin to abrogate NFAT nuclear translocation, and also suppressed other proto-oncogenic pathways including hypoxia, glycolysis, and the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling axis. Our data highlight the potential for targeting the cancer-promoting HSP90 chaperone network to treat GBM."

30639084,"Duffy blood group genes are highly polymorphic with the distribution of alleles varying between different populations and ethnic groups. The aim of this study was to genotype Duffy blood group antigens and to establish FY alleles frequency in the Polish population and screen for novel FY gene mutations. Duffy phenotype and genotype frequencies analysis was based on studies of 596 persons. All these subjects were genotyped by high-resolution melting (HRM) method. It was shown that phenotype Fy(a+b+), defined by genotypes FY*A/FY*B (33%), FY*A/FY*B298A (13%), and FY*A/FY*02W.01 (2.8%) was the most common in Polish population (˜49%), followed by Fy(a-b+), ˜29%, determined by genotypes arising from FY*B allele and all its variants. Fy(a+b-) phenotype occurred with a frequency of 21.3% and was defined by the following genotypes: FY*A/A (21%), and FY*A/02N.01 (0.3%). Among the Polish population the frequencies of FY*A, FY*B, and FY*B298A alleles were 45.7%, 36% and 15.5%, respectively. The alleles FY*B298A and FY*B combined together, represented higher frequency (51%) than FY*A. Alleles FY*02W.01 and FY*02N.01 had frequencies 2.51% and 0.25%, respectively. The distribution of Duffy genotypes in the Polish population was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p = 0.9682). Alleles in the genotypes are independent from each other (r = 0.0278, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.00077). New mutations identified in the promoter region (c.-79T > C) and the coding region of the FY gene (c.147C > A and c.175 G > A) did not affect the Duffy antigen expression on erythrocyte. Although FY alleles frequency is known in different populations, no data for Polish population is available."
30639036,"Immune dysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, enteropathy, X-linked (IPEX) syndrome is a devastating autoimmune disease caused by mutations in FoxP3, a transcription factor required for the development and function of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) can be curative, but suitable donors are often unavailable. Here, we demonstrate a strategy for autologous HSCT and gene therapy utilizing a lentiviral vector (LV) to restore FoxP3 expression under the control of endogenous human FOXP3 regulatory elements. Both murine transplant models and humanized mice engrafted with LV-modified HSCs show high levels of LV expression selective for CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Treg cells. LV transduction of scurfy (FoxP3<sup>mut</sup>) HSCs restores development of functional FoxP3+ Treg cells that suppress T cell proliferation in vitro and rescue the scurfy autoimmune phenotype in vivo. These findings demonstrate preclinical efficacy for the treatment of IPEX patients by autologous HSC transplant and may provide valuable insights into new cell therapies for autoimmunity."

30638965,"Gaucher disease is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disease, caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme, glucocerebrosidase that leads to the accumulation of its substrate (glucosylceramide) in lysosomal macrophages. In the general population, its incidence varies between 0.4 and 5.8/100,000 inhabitants. Type 1 Gaucher disease is the most frequent and is characterized by its extreme heterogeneity including asymptomatic or more severe presentations. The most frequent symptoms are anemia, thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly, and/or hepatomegaly, and a potentially severe bone involvement. Type 2 and type 3 Gaucher diseases are associated with neurological involvement that can be severe. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating a deficiency of glucocerebrosidase activity in leucocytes, and by the identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in GBA1 gene. Type 1 Gaucher disease is associated with a higher risk of Parkinson disease, some solid cancers, and hematologic diseases in particularly multiple myeloma. Specific treatment, such as enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy is indicated in symptomatic type 1 Gaucher disease. Only enzyme replacement therapy is indicated in type 3 Gaucher disease. Treatment improves quality of life and prognosis. The rarity of Gaucher disease and its wide variability in clinical presentations lead to diagnosis delays. There is a strong need for a better knowledge of its symptoms among physicians, to reduce irreversible complications."
30638957,"Synthetic mRNA has emerged as a powerful tool for the transfer of genetic information, and it is being explored for a variety of therapeutic applications. Many of these applications require prolonged intracellular persistence of mRNA to improve bioavailability of the encoded protein. mRNA molecules are intrinsically unstable and their intracellular kinetics depend on the UTRs embracing the coding sequence, in particular the 3' UTR elements. We describe here a novel and generally applicable cell-based selection process for the identification of 3' UTRs that augment the expression of proteins encoded by synthetic mRNA. Moreover, we show, for two applications of mRNA therapeutics, namely, (1) the delivery of vaccine antigens in order to mount T cell immune responses and (2) the introduction of reprogramming factors into differentiated cells in order to induce pluripotency, that mRNAs tagged with the 3' UTR elements discovered in this study outperform those with commonly used 3' UTRs. This approach further leverages the utility of mRNA as a gene therapy drug format."

30638520,"Benzimidazoles have been intensively (for over 40 years) used in the livestock sector, particularly in small ruminants. This has been led to the widespread emergence of resistance in a number of small ruminant parasite species, especially Haemonchus contortus. In many countries benzimidazole resistance has severely compromised the control of H. contortus in small ruminants; but there is a little information on benzimidazole resistance in H. contortus infecting buffalo and cattle. Resistance to benzimidazoles have also been reported in the large ruminant parasite, Haemonchus placei, but again there is relatively little information on its prevalence. Hence it is very important to understand how resistance-conferring mutations emerge and spread in both parasites in buffalo and cattle hosts in order to develop approaches for the recognition of the problem at an early stage of its development. The present study suggests that the F200Y (TAC) mutation is common in H. contortus, being detected in 5/7 populations at frequencies between 7 and 57%. Furthermore, 6/10 H. placei populations contained the F200Y (TAC) mutation, albeit at low frequencies of between 0.4 and 5%. The phylogenetic analysis suggests that the F200Y (TAC) mutation in H. contortus has emerged on multiple occasions in the region, with at least three independent emergences across the populations. In contrast, the F200Y (TAC) resistance-conferring mutation in H. placei is only seen on a single haplotype. A high level frequency of the resistance haplotypes in the region, suggests that the unique resistance conferring-mutation has spread from a single emergence; likely by anthropogenic animal movement. Overall, these results provide the first clear genetic evidence for the spread of benzimidazole resistance-conferring mutations to multiple different locations from a single emergence in H. placei; while being consistent with previous small ruminant-based observations of multiple emergence of resistance mutations in H. contortus."

30638327,"We propose a hypothesis that the causes of aging are not random events, but regular processes due to the dysfunction of species-specific transposons. The hypothesis is justified by the fact that the average life expectancy differs significantly between species. In addition, genomes of different species differ in the composition and arrangement of transposons in them, which control the differentiation of cells in different tissues and at different stages of development. We presented literature data confirming this assumption and substantiating the key role of transposons in regulating gene expression in ontogenesis. In the terminally differentiated cells, the mechanisms of the silencing of mobile elements are activated, which are depleted, which leads to the dysfunction of gene-regulated regulatory networks controlled by transposons, the aging and development of age-associated pathology. Mobile elements are capable of transposing into strictly defined genomic loci, transcribed into functional RNAs that are translated into peptides. We propose that the detection of changes in the activity of specific mobile elements associated with aging through the analysis of non-coding RNA of transposon origin can be the basis for developing ways to increase life expectancy and targeted therapy for age-related pathologies, including malignant tumors. A promising direction in this respect may be the study of peptides that affect the expression of specific transposons and non-coding RNAs."
30638277,"We performed comprehensive genomic analyses of the melatonergic system within the tumor microenvironment and their clinical relevance across a broad spectrum of solid tumors. RNA-seq data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) of 14 solid tumors representing 6,658 human samples were analyzed. The tumor melatonergic system was characterised by the rates of melatonin synthesis and metabolism using a two-gene expression model (melatonin synthesis/metabolism index). We calculated three indexes according to different melatonin metabolism isoenzymes (Index-I [ASMT:CYP1A1], Index-II [ASMT:CYP1A2], and Index-III [ASMT:CYP1B1]). Samples of each cancer type were classified into two subgroups (high vs. low) based on median values. Clinical outcomes, mutational burden, and neoepitope abundance were analyzed and compared. We found that the ability of the tumor microenvironment to synthesize and accumulate melatonin varied across cancer types and negatively correlated with tumor burden. Kaplan-Meier survival analyses and multivariable modeling showed that the three indexes played different roles across different cancers, and harbored prognostic values in breast cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [AHR]<sub>index-</sub><sub>II</sub> = 0.65 [0.44-0.97]; P = 0.03), cervical cancer (AHR<sub>index-I</sub> = 0.62 [0.39-0.98]; P = 0.04), lung squamous cell carcinoma (AHR<sub>index-</sub><sub>III</sub> = 0.75 [0.56-0.99]; P = 0.04), melanoma (AHR<sub>index-I</sub> = 0.74 [0.55-0.98]; P = 0.04), and stomach adenocarcinoma (AHR<sub>index-</sub><sub>III</sub> = 0.68 [0.41-0.94]; P = 0.02). We further investigated its clinical relevance with tumor immunogenic features (mutational burden and neoantigen abundance), which may predict immunotherapy benefits. We observed significant negative correlations with mutational burden in the majority of tumors (P < 0.05), except cervical cancer, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and thyroid carcinoma. Our study provides a systematic overview of the oncostatic values of the melatonergic system, and highlights the utilization of this simple and promising gene signature as a prognosticator and potential predictor of response to immunotherapy.

30637987,"Human amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AF-MSCs) are a new potential stem cell source for cell therapy and regenerative medicine. These are fetal mesenchymal stem cells with multi-lineage differentiation potential found in amniotic fluid. The aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro differentiation initiation of AF-MSCs into cardiac progenitors upon application of inhibitors of DNA methyltransferases (DNMT), such as Decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) and Zebularine. We assessed epigenetic changes and explored patterns of genes, enriched in association with hyperacetylated H4 after induced differentiation. Upregulation of cardiomyogenesis-related genes (TNNT2, MYH6, ACTN2 and DES) and cardiac ion channels genes, downregulation of pluripotency genes-markers as well as increase in Connexin43 expression indicated cardiomyogenic commitment. Evaluation of global epigenetic changes showed that levels of chromatin modifying enzymes, such as Polycomb repressive complex 2 proteins (EZH2, SUZ12), DNMT1, histone deacetylases 1 and 2 were reduced to the similar extent by both differentiation agents. Levels of specific histone marks keeping active state of chromatin (H3K4me3, H3K9Ac and H4hyperAc) increased and marks of repressed chromatin state (H3K27me3 and H3K9me3) decreased after Decitabine or Zebularine treatment. Chip-Seq analysis after chromatin immunoprecipitation with H4hyperAc demonstrated enrichment of around 100 functionally annotated genes, related to chromatin reorganization and cardiomyogenesis, and confirmed relation between H4 hyperacetylation and gene expression. Our results demonstrate that both Decitabine and Zebularine can be potentially used as cardiomyogenic differentiation inducers in AF-MSCs and they cause various genetic and epigenetic changes resulting in global chromatin remodeling."

Genetic polymorphisms in the ABCB1 gene coding for the efflux transporter MDR1 (P-glycoprotein, P-gp) could result in altered tumour response. Hence, this study was proposed to assess the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of ABCB1 gene on tumour response in locally advanced breast cancer patients (LABC) of South India who have a distinct genetic makeup."
30637773,"Hepatocellular adenoma/carcinoma (HCA/HCC) is a long-term complication of glycogen storage disease type-Ia (GSD-Ia) which is caused by a deficiency in glucose-6-phosphatase-α (G6Pase-α or G6PC), a key enzyme in gluconeogenesis. Currently, there is no therapy to address HCA/HCC in GSD-Ia. We have previously shown that a recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vector-mediated G6PC gene transfer to 2-week-old G6pc-/- mice prevents HCA development. However, it remains unclear whether G6PC gene transfer at the tumor developing stage of GSD-Ia can prevent tumor initiation or abrogate the pre-existing tumors. Using liver-specific G6pc-knockout (L-G6pc-/-) mice that develop HCA/HCC, we now show that treating the mice at the tumor-developing stage with rAAV-G6PC restores hepatic G6Pase-α expression, normalizes glucose homeostasis, and prevents de novo HCA/HCC development. The rAAV-G6PC treatment also normalizes defective hepatic autophagy and corrects metabolic abnormalities in the non-tumor liver tissues of both tumor-free and tumor-bearing mice. However, gene therapy cannot restore G6Pase-α expression in the HCA/HCC lesions and fails to abrogate any pre-existing tumors. We show that the expression of 11 β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 that mediates local glucocorticoid activation is down-regulated in HCA/HCC lesions, leading to impairment in glucocorticoid signaling critical for gluconeogenesis activation. This suggests that local glucocorticoid action downregulation in the HCA/HCC lesions may suppress gene therapy mediated G6Pase-α restoration. Collectively, our data show that rAAV-mediated gene therapy can prevent de novo HCA/HCC development in L-G6pc-/- mice at the tumor developing stage, but it cannot reduce any pre-existing tumor burden.

30637723,"Critical limb ischemia (CLI) is the advanced stage of peripheral artery disease spectrum and is defined by limb pain or impending limb loss because of compromised blood flow to the affected extremity. Current conventional therapies for CLI include amputation, bypass surgery, endovascular therapy, and pharmacological approaches. Although these conventional therapeutic strategies still remain as the mainstay of treatments for CLI, novel and promising therapeutic approaches such as proangiogenic gene/protein therapies and stem cell-based therapies have emerged to overcome, at least partially, the limitations and disadvantages of current conventional therapeutic approaches. Such novel CLI treatment options may become even more effective when other complementary approaches such as utilizing proper bioscaffolds are used to increase the survival and engraftment of delivered genes and stem cells. Therefore, herein, we address the benefits and disadvantages of current therapeutic strategies for CLI treatment and summarize the novel and promising therapeutic approaches for CLI treatment. Our analyses also suggest that these novel CLI therapeutic strategies show considerable advantages to be used when current conventional methods have failed for CLI treatment."

Partly because of the limited knowledge of the underlying mechanisms of cancer cachexia derived from human studies, however, the ability to therapeutically intervene remains elusive. The purpose of the current study was therefore to better define the phenotype of skeletal muscle obtained from patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which has one of the highest rates of cachexia."

30637094,"The last decade has seen a sharp increase in the number of scientific publications describing physiological and pathological functions of extracellular vesicles (EVs), a collective term covering various subtypes of cell-released, membranous structures, called exosomes, microvesicles, microparticles, ectosomes, oncosomes, apoptotic bodies, and many other names. However, specific issues arise when working with these entities, whose size and amount often make them difficult to obtain as relatively pure preparations, and to characterize properly. The International Society for Extracellular Vesicles (ISEV) proposed Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (""MISEV"") guidelines for the field in 2014. We now update these ""MISEV2014"" guidelines based on evolution of the collective knowledge in the last four years. An important point to consider is that ascribing a specific function to EVs in general, or to subtypes of EVs, requires reporting of specific information beyond mere description of function in a crude, potentially contaminated, and heterogeneous preparation. For example, claims that exosomes are endowed with exquisite and specific activities remain difficult to support experimentally, given our still limited knowledge of their specific molecular machineries of biogenesis and release, as compared with other biophysically similar EVs. The MISEV2018 guidelines include tables and outlines of suggested protocols and steps to follow to document specific EV-associated functional activities. Finally, a checklist is provided with summaries of key points."
30636949,"Prevalence of hypertension (HTN) varies substantially across different populations. HTN is not only common - affecting at least one third of the world's adult population - but is also the most important driver for cardiovascular diseases. Yet up to a third of hypertensive patients are resistant to therapy, contributed by secondary hypertension but more commonly the hitherto inability to precisely predict response to specific antihypertensive agents. Population and individual genomics information could be useful in guiding the selection and predicting the response to treatment - an approach known as precision medicine. However this cannot be achieved without the knowledge of genetic variations that influence blood pressure (BP). A number of evolutionary factors including population demographics and forces of natural selection may be involved. This article explores some ideas on how natural selection influences BP regulation in ethnically and geographically diverse populations that could lead to them being susceptible to HTN. We explore how such evolutionary factors could impact the implementation of precision medicine in HTN. Finally, in order to ensure the success of precision medicine in HTN, we call for more initiatives to understand the genetic architecture within and between diverse populations with ancestry from different parts of the world, and to precisely classify the intermediate phenotypes of HTN."
30636933,"Genome editing allows for the precise manipulation of DNA sequences in a cell making this technology essential for understanding gene function. CRISPR/Cas9 is a targeted genome-editing platform derived from bacterial adaptive immune system and has been repurposed into a genome-editing tool. The RNA-guided DNA endonuclease, Cas9 can be easily programmed to target new sites by altering its guide RNA sequence, making this technology easier, more efficient, scalable and an indispensable tool in biological research. This technology has helped genetically engineer animal models to understand disease mechanisms and elucidate molecular details that can be exploited for improved therapeutic outcomes. In this review, we describe the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing mechanism, CRISPR-screening methods, therapeutic targeting of CRISPR in animal models and in cancer immunotherapy. We also discuss the ongoing clinical trials using this tool, limitations of this tool that might impede the clinical applicability of CRISPR-Cas9 and future directions for developing effective CRISPR-Cas9 delivery systems that may improve cancer therapeutics."

30636742,"To date, no candidate intervention has demonstrated a disease-modifying effect in Huntington's disease, despite promising results in preclinical studies. In this commentary we discuss disease-modifying therapies that have been trialled in Huntington's disease and speculate that these failures may be attributed, in part, to the assumption that a single drug selectively targeting one aspect of disease pathology will be universally effective, regardless of disease stage or ""subtype"". We therefore propose an alternative approach for effective disease-modification that uses 1) a combination approach rather than monotherapy, and 2) targets the disease process early on - before it is clinically manifest. Finally, we will consider whether this change in approach that we propose will be relevant in the future given the recent shift to targeting more proximal disease processes-e.g., huntingtin gene expression; a timely question given Roche's recent decision to take on the clinical development of a promising new drug candidate in Huntington's disease, IONIS-HTTRx."
30636697,"The neurotrophic tropomyosin or tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) genes (1-3) are proto-oncogenes that when activated are encountered in a wide array of tumours. The recent advent of very specific and selective inhibitors of their gene fusions makes the NRTK gene fusions actionable. NRTK gene fusions are very characteristic of specific tumours: salivary mammary analogue secretory carcinoma, breast secretory carcinoma, infantile fibrosarcoma and congenital mesoblastic nephroma. Over 90% of these tumours bear NTRK gene fusions. While next-generation sequencing is the current platform of choice for the detection of NTRK fusions, immunohistochemistry also shows great promise. Immunohistochemical localisation of the fusion protein to the nucleus, cytoplasm, nuclear membrane and cell membrane is indicative of specific gene fusions involving the NTRK genes."

30636250,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN), a distinct manifestation of diabetic kidney disease, affects approximately 30% of patients with diabetes. While most attention has been focused on glomerular changes related to DN, there is growing evidence that tubulopathy is a key feature in the pathogenesis of this disease. The renal proximal tubule cells (RPTCs) are particularly sensitive to the deleterious effect of chronic hyperglycemia. However, the cellular changes that control the dysfunction of the RPTCs are not fully understood. Controlling glucose reabsorption in the proximal tubules via inhibition of glucose transporters (GLUT) has emerged as a promising therapeutic in ameliorating DN. Overactivation of the renal endocannabinoid (eCB) system via the cannabinoid-1 receptor (CB1R) contributes to the development of DN, and its blockade by globally acting or peripherally restricted CB1R antagonists has been shown to ameliorate renal dysfunction in different murine models for diabetes. Recently, we have utilized various pharmacological and genetic tools to show that the eCB/CB1R system contributes to the development of DN via regulating the expression, translocation, and activity of the facilitative GLUT2 located in the RPTCs. These findings have the potential to be translated into therapy, and support the rationale for the preclinical development of novel renal-specific CB1R and/or GLUT2 inhibitors for the treatment of DN."
30636240,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent flares, intense itching, erythema, dry skin resulting from skin barrier defects, and staphylococcal infections. Multiple factors may affect the skin`s normal barrier function, including filaggrin gene mutations, immune dysregulation, altered skin microbiome, altered lipids in stratum corneum, or deficiency of antimicrobial peptides AMPs. The disease mainly affects children, causing a considerable impact on the quality of their life; its first manifestations occur with up to 90% of cases before the age of 5. For years emollients have been known as oily substances used to treat rough, scaling, xerotic conditions to make skin flexible and soft. Recently, we have learned that emollients can also moisten and hydrate dry skin, so the terms ""emollient"" and ""moisturizer"" are often used interchangeably. According to current management guidelines on atopic dermatitis prepared by dermatological societies, long-term emollient application direct to the skin and as bath additives are the basic therapy of atopic dermatitis. Emollients may be used in monotherapy or - in the flares - in conjunction with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Clinical trials proved that regular emollient application moistens and hydrates the skin and helps the skin maintain a defensive barrier effect as well as reduces the amount of topical corticosteroids needed for atopic eczema in infants, children and adult patients. The results of trials and long clinical experience proved that emollients are safe and effective in patients with atopic dermatitis. This paper presents information based on recent knowledge concerning emollients: an overview of emollient components, their properties, mechanism of action, and the role they play in atopic eczema, as well as the results of clinical trials performed in children with atopic dermatitis."
30636062,"Variants of uncertain significance (VUS) are a well-recognized source of uncertainty in genomic medicine. Despite the existence of straightforward clinical management recommendations, patients report feeling anxiety, worry, and uncertainty in response to VUS. We report the first structured analysis of patient perspectives of VUS-related uncertainty in genome sequencing using Han's taxonomy of genomic uncertainty. We conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 11 patients to elicit their thoughts regarding implications of the result for themselves and their family members. Patients' primary concern with VUS-related uncertainty involved personal and practical issues as they directly inform health-care decisions. Patients demonstrated good understanding of the epistemic nature of VUS uncertainty-that information about such variant is currently unknown. However, between-provider discordance in explanations of the implication of this uncertainty for patients' diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy was a major contributor to the overall experience of uncertainty. Strategies for uncertainty reduction involved periodically checking back for reclassification and receiving concordant and clear recommendation from providers. Other proactive strategies of uncertainty reduction-such as information seeking and reading the genetic test report-were not helpful. Collectively, these findings offer previously unreported insight into uncertainty management strategies used by patients which have the potential to guide clinical management practices."
30635953,"Genome editing, as exemplified by CRISPR/Cas9, is now recognized as a powerful tool for the engineering of endogenous target genes. It employs only two components, namely, Cas9 in the form of DNA, mRNA, or protein; and guide RNA (gRNA), which is specific to a target gene. When these components are transferred to cells, they create insertion/deletion mutations (indels) within a target gene. Therefore, when fetuses within the uteri of pregnant murine females are exposed to these reagents, fetal cells incorporating them should show mutations in the target gene. To examine a possible genome editing of fetal cells in vivo, we intravenously administered a solution containing plasmid DNA-FuGENE complex to pregnant wild-type female mice [which had been successfully mated with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-expressing male transgenic mice] on day 12.5 of gestation. The plasmid DNA induces the expression of gRNA, which was targeted at the EGFP cDNA, and that of the Cas9 gene. All fetuses in the pregnant females should express EGFP systemically, since they are heterozygous (Tg/+) for the transgene. Thus, the delivery of CRISPR system targeted at EGFP in the fetuses will cause a reduced expression of EGFP as a result of the genome editing of EGFP genomic sequence. Of the 24 fetuses isolated from three pregnant females 2 days after gene delivery, 3 were found to have reduced fluorescence in their hearts. Genotyping of the dissected hearts revealed the presence of the transgene construct (Cas9 gene) in all the samples. Furthermore, all the three samples exhibited mutations at the target loci, although normal cells were also present. Thus, transplacental delivery of gene editing components may be a useful tool for developing animal models with heart disorder for heart-related disease research, and gene therapy in congenital heart defects such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). © 2019 IUBMB Life, 9999(9999):1-10, 2019."
30635921,"Abnormal development of embryonic conus arteriosus could lead to conotruncal defects in fetal heart, and increase the incidence of fetal congenital heart disease. Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is one of the most common forms of congenital heart disease. It may be helpful for us to solve this clinical problem through exploring the molecular mechanisms of development in embryonic congenital heart disease. Proteomics has attracted much attention in understanding the development of human diseases during the past decades. However, there is still little information about the relationship between protein expression pattern and TOF. In this study, we aimed to explore the potential linkage of proteomics and TOF development. Briefly, 121 differentially expressed proteins were identified from a TOF group, compared with a control group. The expression levels of 34 of these proteins were significantly different (>1.5 absolute fold change, p < 0.05) between the two groups. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway analysis showed that these proteins were mainly associated with carbon metabolism, biosynthesis of antibodies, positive regulation of transcription from RNA polymerase II promoter, nucleus, ATP binding, and so on. The ingenuity pathway analysis (IPA) results indicated that 435 of upstream regulators were identified of these differentially expressed proteins, which might be involved in the development of TOF. Data of string analysis showed the protein-protein interaction network among the differentially expressed proteins and regulators, which are related to TOF. In conclusion, our study explored the protein expression pattern of TOF, which might provide new insights into understanding the mechanism of TOF development and afford potential targets for TOF diagnosis and therapy."
30635889,"The transcription factor p73 synthesizes a large number of isoforms and presents high structural and functional homology with p53, a well-known tumor suppressor and a famous ""Holy Grail"" of anticancer targeting. p73 has attracted increasing attention mainly because (a) unlike p53, p73 is rarely mutated in cancer, (b) some p73 isoforms can inhibit all hallmarks of cancer, and (c) it has the ability to mimic oncosuppressive functions of p53, even in p53-mutated cells. These attributes render p73 and its downstream pathways appealing for therapeutic targeting, especially in mutant p53-driven cancers. p73 functions are, at least partly, mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs), which constitute nodal components of p73-governed networks. p73 not only regulates transcription of crucial miRNA genes, but is also predicted to affect miRNA populations in a transcription-independent manner by developing protein-protein interactions with components of the miRNA processing machinery. This combined effect of p73, both in miRNA transcription and maturation, appears to be isoform-dependent and can result in a systemic switch of cell miRNomes toward either an anti-oncogenic or oncogenic outcome. In this review, we combine literature search with bioinformatics approaches to reconstruct the p73-governed miRNA network and discuss how these crosstalks may be exploited to develop next-generation therapeutics."
30635783,"Disruption of brain insulin signaling may explain the higher Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk among type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients. There is evidence from in vitro and human postmortem studies that combination of insulin with hypoglycemic medications is neuroprotective and associated with less amyloid aggregation. We examined the effect of 8-month intranasal administration of insulin, exenatide (a GLP-1 agonist), combination therapy (insulin + exenatide) or saline, in wild-type (WT) and an AD-like mouse model (Tg2576). Mice were assessed for learning, gene expression of key mediators and effectors of the insulin receptor signaling pathway (IRSP-IRS1, AKT1, CTNNB1, INSR, IRS2, GSK3B, IGF1R, AKT3), and brain Amyloid Beta (Aβ) levels. In Tg2576 mice, combination therapy reduced expression of IRSP genes which was accompanied by better learning. Cortical Aβ levels were decreased by 15-30% in all groups compared to saline but this difference did not reach statistical significance. WT mice groups, with or without treatment, did not differ in any comparison. Disentangling the mechanisms underlying the potential beneficial effects of combination therapy on the IR pathway and AD-like behavior is warranted."

These predictors include but are certainly not limited to genetic variations, clinical factors, and demographic factors. However, no clinical application is currently available. This review also describes the challenges in treating patients with RA and the need for personalized medicine. At the end of this review, we discuss possible strategies to enhance the prediction of drug responsiveness in patients with RA."
30635776,"Cerebellar ataxias (CA) include a range of neurodegenerative disorders hallmarked by deterioration of the cerebellum. Cell replacement therapy (CRT) offers a potential remedy for the diseases associated with the central nervous system (CNS). This study was designed to assess the neurorestorative/protective effects of dental pulp stem cell (DPSC) implantation on a rat model of CA induced by 3-acetylpyridine (3-AP) as a neurotoxin. To begin, human DPSCs were extracted, cultured and phenotypically characterized. Then, experimental ataxia was induced in 20 male adult rats by a single injection of 3-AP and bilateral DPSC transplantation was performed 3 days after 3-AP administration, followed by stereological analysis of cerebellar layers along with assessment of motor skills and inflammatory response. The findings showed that transplantation of DPSCs in a 3-AP model of ataxia ameliorated motor coordination and muscle activity, increased cerebellar volumes of molecular and granular layers plus white matter, reduced the levels of inflammatory cytokines and thwarted the degeneration of Purkinje cells against 3-AP toxicity. Taken together, human DPSCs could be considered as a suitable candidate for CRT-based therapies with a specific focus on CA."
30635632,"POEMS syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disease associated with monoclonal plasma cells; however, the pathogenic importance of plasma cells remains unclear. We performed comprehensive genetic analyses of plasma cells in 20 patients with POEMS syndrome. Whole exome sequencing was performed in 11 cases and found a total of 308 somatic mutations in 285 genes. Targeted sequencing was performed in all 20 cases and identified 20 mutations in 7 recurrently mutated genes, namely KLHL6, LTB, EHD1, EML4, HEPHL1, HIPK1, and PCDH10. None of the driver gene mutations frequently found in multiple myeloma (MM) such as NRAS, KRAS, BRAF, and TP53 was detected. Copy number analysis showed chromosomal abnormalities shared with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), suggesting a partial overlap in the early development of MGUS and POEMS syndrome. RNA sequencing revealed a transcription profile specific to POEMS syndrome when compared with normal plasma cells, MGUS and MM. Unexpectedly, disease-specific VEGFA expression was not increased in POEMS syndrome. Our study illustrates that the genetic and transcriptional profiles of plasma cells in POEMS syndrome are distinct from MM and MGUS, indicating unique function of clonal plasma cells in its pathogenesis."
30635631,"KIT D816 mutations (KIT D816<sup>mut</sup>) are strongly associated with systemic mastocytosis (SM) but are also detectable in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), where they represent an adverse prognostic factor in combination with core binding factor (CBF) fusion genes. Here, we evaluated the clinical and molecular features of KIT D816<sup>mut</sup>/CBF-negative (CBF<sup>neg</sup>) AML, a previously uncharacterized combination. All KIT D816<sup>mut</sup>/CBF<sup>neg</sup> cases (n = 40) had histologically proven SM with associated AML (SM-AML). Molecular analyses revealed at least one additional somatic mutation (median, n = 3) beside KIT D816 (e.g., SRSF2, 38%; ASXL1, 31%; RUNX1, 34%) in 32/32 (100%) patients. Secondary AML evolved in 29/40 (73%) patients from SM ± associated myeloid neoplasm. Longitudinal molecular and cytogenetic analyses revealed the acquisition of new mutations and/or karyotype evolution in 15/16 (94%) patients at the time of SM-AML. Median overall survival (OS) was 5.4 months. A screen of two independent AML databases (AML<sup>databases</sup>) revealed remarkable similarities between KIT D816<sup>mut</sup>/CBF<sup>neg</sup> SM-AML and KIT D816<sup>mut</sup>/CBF<sup>neg</sup> AML<sup>databases</sup> (n = 69) with regard to KIT D816<sup>mut</sup> variant allele frequency, mutation profile, aberrant karyotype, and OS suggesting underlying SM in a significant proportion of AML<sup>databases</sup> patients. Bone marrow histology and reclassification as SM-AML has important clinical implications regarding prognosis and potential inclusion of KIT inhibitors in treatment concepts."
30635569,"Hypoglycaemia (low plasma glucose) is a serious and potentially fatal complication of insulin-treated diabetes. In healthy individuals, hypoglycaemia triggers glucagon secretion, which restores normal plasma glucose levels by stimulation of hepatic glucose production. This counterregulatory mechanism is impaired in diabetes. Here we show in mice that therapeutic concentrations of insulin inhibit glucagon secretion by an indirect (paracrine) mechanism mediated by stimulation of intra-islet somatostatin release. Insulin's capacity to inhibit glucagon secretion is lost following genetic ablation of insulin receptors in the somatostatin-secreting δ-cells, when insulin-induced somatostatin secretion is suppressed by dapagliflozin (an inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-tranporter-2; SGLT2) or when the action of secreted somatostatin is prevented by somatostatin receptor (SSTR) antagonists. Administration of these compounds in vivo antagonises insulin's hypoglycaemic effect. We extend these data to isolated human islets. We propose that SSTR or SGLT2 antagonists should be considered as adjuncts to insulin in diabetes therapy."
30635159,"Mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB is caused by a marked decrease in N-acetyl-α-d-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) enzyme activity, which leads to the accumulation of heparan sulfate in key organs, progressive brain atrophy, and neurocognitive decline. In this open-label study, 11 eligible patients aged 2 to <12 years (developmental age ≥ 1 year) were sequentially allocated to recombinant human NAGLU enzyme (SBC-103) in 3 staggered- and escalating-dose groups (0.3 mg/kg [n = 3], 1.0 mg/kg [n = 4], or 3.0 mg/kg [n = 4]) by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks for 24 weeks, followed by a 4-week interruption (Part A), treatment at 1.0 and/or 3.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks starting at week 28 (Part B), and treatment at 5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks (Part C) for approximately 2 total years in the study. The primary objective of the study was safety and tolerability evaluation; secondary objectives included evaluation of SBC-103 effects on total heparan sulfate levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brain structural magnetic resonance imaging (cortical gray matter volume), and neurocognitive status (age equivalent/developmental quotient). During the study, 13 treatment-emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 3 patients; 32 infusion-associated reactions (IARs) occurred in 8 patients. Most AEs were mild and intravenous treatment with SBC-103 was well tolerated. Mean (SD) changes from baseline at 52 weeks in Part C for the 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg doses, respectively, were: -4.7% (8.3) and - 4.7% (14.7) for heparan sulfate levels in CSF, -8.1% (3.5) and - 10.3% (9.4) for cortical gray matter volume, +2.3 (6.9) points and +1.0 (9.2) points in cognitive age equivalent and -8.9 (10.2) points and -14.4 (9.2) points in developmental quotient. In summary, SBC-103 was generally well tolerated. Changes in heparan sulfate levels in CSF were small and were not maintained from earlier study time points, there was no clear evidence overall of clinically meaningful improvement in neurocognitive function at the higher doses investigated, and no dose-dependent effects were observed."
30635073,"Thoroughly understanding the molecular mechanisms responsible for the biological properties of pluripotent stem cells, as well as for the processes involved in reprograming, differentiation, and transition between Naïve and Primed pluripotent states, is of great interest in basic and applied research. Although pluripotent cells have been extensively characterized in terms of their transcriptome and miRNome, a comprehensive understanding of how these gene products specifically impact their biology, depends on gain- or loss-of-function experimental approaches capable to systematically interrogate their function. We review all studies carried up to date that used arrayed screening approaches to explore the function of these genetic elements on those biological contexts, using focused or genome-wide genetic libraries. We further discuss the limitations and advantages of approaches based on assays with population-level primary readouts, derived from single-parameter plate readers, or cell-level primary readouts, obtained using multiparametric flow cytometry or quantitative fluorescence microscopy (i.e., high-content screening). Finally, we discuss technical limitation and future perspectives, highlighting how the integration of screening data may lead to major advances in the field of stem cell research and therapy."
30635059,"Human mesenchymal stem cells are a strong candidate for cell therapies owing to their regenerative potential, paracrine regulatory effects, and immunomodulatory activity. Yet, their scarcity, limited expansion potential, and age-associated functional decline restrict the ability to consistently manufacture large numbers of safe and therapeutically effective mesenchymal stem cells for routine clinical applications. To overcome these limitations and advance stem cell treatments using mesenchymal stem cells, researchers have recently derived mesenchymal progenitors from human-induced pluripotent stem cells. Human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitors resemble adult mesenchymal stem cells in morphology, global gene expression, surface antigen profile, and multi-differentiation potential, but unlike adult mesenchymal stem cells, it can be produced in large numbers for every patient. For therapeutic applications, however, human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived progenitors must be produced without animal-derived components (xeno-free) and in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice guidelines."

30634952,"Cancer metastasis is the major cause of mortality in cancer cases and is responsible for cancer deaths. It is known that cancer cells communicate with surrounding microenvironmental cells, such as fibroblast cells, immune cells, and endothelial cells, to create a cancer microenvironment for their progression. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are small vesicles that can be secreted by most types of cells and play an important role in cell-to-cell communications via transferring bioactive cargos, including variable RNAs, such as microRNAs (miRNAs), to recipient cells. miRNAs are a class of small noncoding RNAs that posttranscriptionally regulate gene expression. The transfer of them to recipient cells influences the metastatic process of primary tumors. In this review, we summarize the function of miRNAs packaged in EVs in cancer metastasis and discuss the clinical utility of miRNAs in EVs."
30634918,"Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a rare, genetically heterogeneous disorder that manifests oculocutaneous albinism together with bleeding diatheses that reflect a platelet storage pool deficiency. Ten genetic subtypes of this autosomal recessive condition have been described to date. Some patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1, 4, or 6 develop Crohn's-like inflammatory bowel disease at any age including early childhood, but most often in adolescence or young adulthood. Here we report infantile-onset of inflammatory bowel disease in a patient with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome type 1 who responded to infliximab."
30634595,"Natural killer (NK) cells stand out as promising candidates for cellular immunotherapy due to their capacity to kill malignant cells. However, the therapeutic use of NK cells is often dependent on cell expansion and activation with considerable amounts of serum and exogenous cytokines. We aimed to develop an expansion protocol for NK-92 cells in an effort to generate a cost-efficient, xeno-free, clinical grade manufactured master cell line for therapeutic applications. By making functional assays with NK-92 cells cultured under serum-free conditions (NK-92<sub>SF</sub>) and comparing to serum-supplemented NK-92 cells (NK-92<sub>S</sub>) we did not observe significant alterations in the viability, proliferation, receptor expression levels, or in perforin and granzyme levels. Interestingly, even though NK-92<sub>SF</sub> cells displayed decreased degranulation and cytotoxicity against tumor cells in vitro, the degranulation capacity was recovered after overnight incubation with 20% serum in the medium. Moreover, lentiviral vector-based genetic modification efficiency of NK-92<sub>SF</sub> cells was comparable with NK-92<sub>S</sub> cells. The application of similar strategies can be useful in reducing the costs of manufacturing cells for clinical use and can help us understand and implement strategies towards chemically defined expansion and genetic modification protocols."
30634552,"Graphene and its derivatives are emerging as attractive materials for biomedical applications, including antibacterial, gene delivery, contrast imaging, and anticancer therapy applications. It is of fundamental importance to study the cytotoxicity and biocompatibility of these materials as well as how they interact with the immune system. The present study was conducted to assess the immunotoxicity of graphene oxide (GO) and vanillin-functionalized GO (V-rGO) on THP-1 cells, a human acute monocytic leukemia cell line. The synthesized GO and V-rGO were characterized by using various analytical techniques. Various concentrations of GO and V-rGO showed toxic effects on THP-1 cells such as the loss of cell viability and proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Cytotoxicity was further demonstrated as an increased level of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), decreased level of ATP content, and cell death. Increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation caused redox imbalance in THP-1 cells, leading to increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and decreased levels of anti-oxidants such as glutathione (GSH), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), super oxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT). Increased generation of ROS and reduced MMP with simultaneous increases in the expression of pro-apoptotic genes and downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes suggest that the mitochondria-mediated pathway is involved in GO and V-rGO-induced apoptosis. Apoptosis was induced consistently with the significant DNA damage caused by increased levels of 8-oxo-dG and upregulation of various key DNA-regulating genes in THP-1 cells, indicating that GO and V-rGO induce cell death through oxidative stress. As a result of these events, GO and V-rGO stimulated the secretion of various cytokines and chemokines, indicating that the graphene materials induced potent inflammatory responses to THP-1 cells. The harshness of V-rGO in all assays tested occurred because of better charge transfer, various carbon to oxygen ratios, and chemical compositions in the rGO. Overall, these findings suggest that it is essential to better understand the parameters governing GO and functionalized GO in immunotoxicity and inflammation. Rational design of safe GO-based formulations for various applications, including nanomedicine, may result in the development of risk management methods for people exposed to graphene and graphene family materials, as these nanoparticles can be used as delivery agents in various biomedical applications."
30634442,"The epigenetic machinery deputed to control histone post-translational modifications is frequently dysregulated in cancer cells. With epigenetics being naturally reversible, it represents a good target for therapies directed to restore normal gene expression. Since the discovery of Bromodomain and Extra Terminal (BET) inhibitors, a great effort has been spent investigating the effects of chromatin readers' inhibition, specifically the class of proteins assigned to bind acetylated and methylated residues. So far, focused studies have been produced on epigenetic regulation, dissecting a specific class of epigenetic-related proteins or investigating epigenetic therapy in a specific tumor type. In this review, recent steps toward drug discovery on the different classes of chromatin readers have been outlined, highlighting the pros and cons of current therapeutic approaches."
30634106,"Adjuvant chemotherapy shows clear benefits in HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer (BC). Its benefits are less universal in BCs expressing hormone receptors. The 21-gene Oncotype DX<sup>®</sup> Breast Recurrence Score test was designed for HR+, HER2- early-stage BC before decision on adjuvant chemotherapy. Its validity and utility was demonstrated prospectively across multiple studies. The observational study PONDx characterized the use of Oncotype DX<sup>®</sup> Breast in routine practice in France and evaluated its decision impact. Of 882 ER-positive BC patients (67% postmenopausal), most (79%) had N0/Nmic node involvement, grade 2 tumors (68%), tumor size 1-5 cm (88%), and ductal histology (78%). BCs with histopathologically elevated recurrence risk included grade 3: 18%; N1: 21%; Ki67 > 20%: 31%. Recurrence Score results by prognostic category were: <18: 54%, 18-30: 36%; >30: 10%. Compared to recommendations before individual availability of the score, results prompted net absolute reductions in chemotherapy recommendations of 36% (total population), and 29% (grade 3 and/or Ki67 > 20% histologies). Decisions reflected prognostic implications: in the Recurrence Score <18 category, 95% of patients received recommendations of hormonal therapy only, in the >30 category, 97.5% were recommended additional chemotherapy; 95% followed the final recommendations of their physicians. The Recurrence Score provides independent predictive and prognostic information in ER + N0/N1 early BC, including high-risk subgroups. PONDx further characterizes the population where the test is beneficial in real-life use and fits current clinical needs. Oncotype DX<sup>®</sup> Breast enables relevant net reductions in chemotherapy use, sparing patients from serious toxicities. Its therapeutic implications are highly accepted by physicians and patients."
30633621,"Delivery of negatively charged, high molecular weight and unstable siRNA is difficult. The present study describes the development and comparison of cationic liposomes (CLs) and polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer generation 4 (PG4) nanocarriers of gene for cancer therapy. CLs and PG4 were complexed with anticancer siRNA (siPlk1) to form siPlk1-CLs lipoplex and siPlk1-PG4 dendriplex. siPlk1-CLs/PG4 complexes were characterized for average particle size, zeta potential, fluorescence and integrity of siPlk1 by agarose gel electrophoresis, ethidium bromide intercalation assay, circular dichroism, protection against RNase and stability in serum. The complexation of CLs/siPlk1 and PG4/siPlk1 were at a 100/1 and 2/1 charge ratio respectively. The CLs and PG4 were effective in protecting siPlk1 from RNase activity, also they enhanced the siPlk1 serum stability. Additionally, siPlk1-CLs and siPlk1-PG4 were evaluated by cell culture studies. In vitro anticancer activity study using MCF-7 cells showed that siPlk1-CLs and siPlk1-PG4 causes nearly similar cell death. Both siPlk1-CLs and siPlk1-PG4 resulted in enhanced cellular uptake of siPlk1 in MDA-MB-231 cells compared to naked siPlk1 solution. Cell cycle analysis suggested that increased cell population arrest in subG1 phase by siPlk1-CLs and siPlk1-PG4 compared to naked siPlk1 solution. These observations suggested that CLs and PG4 can be a potential carrier for siPlk1 delivery in breast cancer treatment."
30633424,"Serous ovarian cancer is the most frequent type of epithelial ovarian cancer. Despite the use of surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, many patients suffer from recurrence within 6 months, termed platinum resistance. Currently, the lack of relevant molecular biomarkers for the prediction of the early recurrence of serous ovarian cancers is linked to the poor prognosis. To identify an effective biomarker for early recurrence, we analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation status characteristic of early recurrence after treatment. The patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset who showed a complete response after the first therapy were categorized into 2 groups: early recurrence serous ovarian cancer (ERS, recurrence ≤12 months, n = 51) and late recurrence serous ovarian cancer (LRS, recurrence >12 months, n = 158). Among the 12 differently methylated probes identified between the 2 groups, we found that ZNF671 was the most significantly methylated gene in the early recurrence group. A validation cohort of 78 serous ovarian cancers showed that patients with ZNF671 DNA methylation had a worse prognosis (P < .05). The multivariate analysis revealed that the methylation status of ZNF671 was an independent factor for predicting the recurrence of serous ovarian cancer patients both in the TCGA dataset and our cohort (P = .049 and P = .021, respectively). Functional analysis revealed that the depletion of ZNF671 expression conferred a more migratory and invasive phenotype to the ovarian cancer cells. Our data indicate that ZNF671 functions as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer and that the DNA methylation status of ZNF671 might be an effective biomarker for the recurrence of serous ovarian cancer after platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy."
30633395,"Neural stem cells (NSCs), capable of ischemia-homing, regeneration, and differentiation, exert strong therapeutic potentials in treating ischemic stroke, but the curative effect is limited in the harsh microenvironment of ischemic regions rich in reactive oxygen species (ROS). Gene transfection to make NSCs overexpress brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can enhance their therapeutic efficacy; however, viral vectors must be used because current nonviral vectors are unable to efficiently transfect NSCs. The first polymeric vector, ROS-responsive charge-reversal poly[(2-acryloyl)ethyl(p-boronic acid benzyl)diethylammonium bromide] (B-PDEA), is shown here, that mediates efficient gene transfection of NSCs and greatly enhances their therapeutics in ischemic stroke treatment. The cationic B-PDEA/DNA polyplexes can effectively transfect NSCs; in the cytosol, the B-PDEA is oxidized by intracellular ROS into negatively charged polyacrylic acid, quickly releasing the BDNF plasmids for efficient transcription and secreting a high level of BDNF. After i.v. injection in ischemic stroke mice, the transfected NSCs (BDNF-NSCs) can home to ischemic regions as efficiently as the pristine NSCs but more efficiently produce BDNF, leading to significantly augmented BDNF levels, which in turn enhances the mouse survival rate to 60%, from 0% (nontreated mice) or ≈20% (NSC-treated mice), and enables more rapid and superior functional reconstruction."
30633331,"Women with breast cancer (BCa) experience heightened distress, which is related to greater inflammation and poorer outcomes. The s100 protein family facilitates the inflammatory response by regulating myeloid cell function through the binding of Toll-like receptor 4 and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). The heterodimer s100A8/A9 RAGE ligand is associated with hastened tumor development and metastasis. Previously, a 10-week stress-management intervention using cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and relaxation training (RT) was associated with less leukocyte inflammatory gene expression in patients with BCa; however, its impact on s100A8/A9 was not examined. Because a 10-week intervention may be impractical during primary treatment for BCa, the authors developed briefer forms of CBT and RT and demonstrated their efficacy in reducing distress over 12 months of primary treatment. Here, the effects of these briefer interventions were tested effects on s100A8/A9 levels over the initial 12 months of BCa treatment."
30633235,"The noncoding part of the human genome, which was previously considered nonfunctional or junk DNA, has been the subject of extensive research this decade. Nevertheless, long noncoding RNAs still represent one of the least investigated fields because of their complexity, multiplicity, and diversity. While some long noncoding RNAs have been characterized fairly well, the functions of many others remain poorly understood. Long noncoding RNAs play an essential role in the regulation of gene expression in all tissues and on all developmental stages. They are involved in a number of signaling pathways, and their aberrant functioning can be pathogenic. This review aims to summarize current state-of-the-art structures of these transcripts in this research field, their genomic localization, their functions, and underlying mechanisms. It also focuses on cancer-associated aberrations of long noncoding RNAs, as well as on prospects of their application in tumor diagnostics and therapy. Examples of decreasing the levels of oncogenic long noncoding RNAs via silencing with short interfering RNAs, antisense oligonucleotides, or low molecular-weight inhibitors are also described."

30633152,"To analyze whether neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) changes the expression rates of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) markers: estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), Ki67, and P53.This was a retrospective study of 112 IDC patients who underwent NAC (docetaxel+epirubicin/pirarubicin+cyclophosphamide) but without pathological complete response (pCR) in 2012 to 2013 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. The IDC subtypes and tumor protein markers were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Specific changes in tumor protein markers before/after NAC were compared.The decrease in the positive rate of Ki-67 was the most significant, from 75.9% before NAC to 41.1% after NAC (P < .001). The positive rate of HER2 decreased from 42.0% before NAC to 32.1% after NAC (P = .04). The positive rate of ER decreased from 66.1% before NAC to 56.2% after NAC (P = .04). Increased number of metastatic lymph nodes (P = .006) and body mass index (BMI) (P = .028) seemed to be related to conversion of PR (positive to negative). There was statistical association between the Ki-67 (positive to negative) with the age greater or equal to 50 (P = .015). The BMI greater or equal to 24 (P = .021), age greater or equal to 50 (P = .047), and blood type A (P = .038) were independently associated with conversion of P53 (positive to negative). The BMI greater or equal to 24 (P = .004), number of metastatic lymph nodes greater or equal to 1 (P = .029) and TNM stages I-II (P = .008) were statistically associated with change of HER2 (positive to negative).In patients without pCR, NAC leads to changes in Ki-67, HER2, and hormone receptor (HR) expression. Age, BMI, number of metastatic lymph nodes, and TNM stage are associated with some changes of markers."

Despite significant improvement in the pathologic insight into this group of disorders, therapeutic options remain limited and allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation is the only treatment that can induce long-term remission in patients with MDS. The goals of therapy for MDS are based on disease prognostication, with a focus of minimizing transfusion dependence and preserving quality of life in low-risk groups and preventing progression of disease to acute myeloid leukemia in high-risk groups. Given the dearth of approved treatment options, there is a marked need for novel therapies across the board, and there are several novel agents currently in the pipeline."

30632669,"Prostate cancer (PCa) death primarily occurs due to metastasis of the cells, but little is known about the underlying molecular mechanisms. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of UNC5D, a newly identified tumor suppressor gene, analyze its epigenetic alterations, and elucidate its functional relevance to PCa metastasis. Meta-analysis of publicly available microarray datasets revealed that UNC5D expression was frequently down-regulated in PCa tissues and inversely associated with the PCa metastasis. These results were verified in clinical specimens by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry assays. Through methylation analysis, the down-regulated expression of UNC5D in PCa tissues and cell lines was found to be attributable to the hypermethylation of the promoter. A negative correlation was observed between methylation and UNC5D mRNA expression in PCa samples. The ectopic expression of UNC5D in PCa cells effectively reduced their ability to migrate and invade both in vitro and in vivo, and siRNA-mediated knockdown of UNC5D yielded consistent results. UNC5D can recruit and activate DAPK1, which remained to be essential for its metastatic suppressor function. In conclusion, these results suggested that UNC5D as a novel putative metastatic suppressor gene that is commonly down-regulated by hypermethylation in PCa. This article is protected by copyright.

Protracted efforts have been made to treat the disease. Cumulative technological innovations are encapsulated by patents, and patent citations have been used to analyze technology diffusion processes in R&D, which is essential to identifying technology evolution trends and providing a review of PD treatment from the perspective of technology flows. Areas covered: A patent citation network was utilized to analyze technology flows. Patents related to anti-PD drugs were collected from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (U.S. PTO) database. A total of 1,231 patents and 2,995 internal citations granted between 1988 and 2017 were included and analyzed. Expert opinion: To launch drugs with greater efficiency and safety, approaches such as long-acting sustained release, controlled osmotic release, and other novel drug delivery systems should be emphasized. Multi-target agents could effectively reduce side effects in mono-drug therapy and are worth further exploration. Investors should keep an eye on alpha-synuclein-related therapy, gene therapy, and other experimental therapies that might trigger a historic revolution in the treatment domain."
30632408,The skin is considered as well suited for gene therapy and vaccination. DNA vaccines elicit both broad humoral and cellular immune responses when injected in the skin. Physical and chemical methods are needed to boost the expression. Gene electrotransfer (GET) is one of the most effective approaches. This step-by-step protocol describes the procedures to obtain an efficient GET targeted to the skin by using easy-to-use noninvasive electrodes after intradermal plasmid injection (i.d. GET). A specific pulse sequence is reported. Expression is observed by in vivo fluorescence imaging during >2 weeks as the plasmid was coding for tdTomato. The protocol is efficient for the transient expression of clinical proteins.
30632059,"Acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the most common acute leukemia in adults, increases exponentially with age. While a number of recent advances have improved treatment, high cure rates have not yet been achieved. Nucleophosmin (NPM1) is found mutated in nearly one-third of newly diagnosed cases and leads to NPM1 protein that is mislocalized to the cytoplasm instead of the nucleolus. If the mechanistic basis through which this mislocalization leads to malignancy could be revealed, this AML subtype may be targetable with new drugs. Here, we review the structure and functions of the normal and mutant forms of nucleophosmin. We discuss several recent studies that have shed light on the pathophysiology of NPM1 mutations. We discuss the importance of HOX gene misregulation in NPM1-mutated leukemias, as well as evidence for the reliance of mutated NPM1 on its continued nuclear export. Together, these aspects, as well as new tools to manipulate and study NPM1, open the door to new therapeutic strategies that may ultimately improve treatment of this common subtype of AML."

30631982,"The autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulates all organs in the body independent of consciousness, and is thus essential for maintaining homeostasis of the entire organism. Diseases of the ANS can arise due to environmental insults such as injury, toxins/drugs and infections or due to genetic lesions. Human studies and animal models have been instrumental to understanding connectivity and regulation of the ANS and its disorders. However, research into cellular pathologies and molecular mechanisms of ANS disorders has been hampered by the difficulties in accessing human patient-derived ANS cells in large numbers to conduct meaningful research, mainly because patient neurons cannot be easily biopsied and primary human neuronal cultures cannot be expanded.Human-induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) technology can elegantly bridge these issues, allowing unlimited access of patient-derived ANS cell types for cellular, molecular and biochemical analysis, facilitating the discovery of novel therapeutic targets, and eventually leading to drug discovery. Additionally, such cells may provide a source for cell replacement therapy to replenish lost or injured ANS tissue in patients.Here, we first review the anatomy and embryonic development of the ANS, as this knowledge is crucial for understanding disease modeling approaches. We then review the current advances in human stem cell technology for modeling diseases of the ANS, recent strides toward cell replacement therapy and drug discovery initiatives."
30631853,"<b>Purpose:</b> The Jefferson Pancreas Tumor Registry (JPTR) is a voluntary hospital-based registry of persons with pancreas and related periampullary cancers, premalignant lesions, and nonaffected family members (NAFMs). The ultimate goals of the JPTR are to provide a link between family history, gene mutations, and precision medicine therapy, and to identify high-risk NAFMs for potential surveillance screening. <b>Methods:</b> The JPTR is an Institutional Review Board approved longitudinal epidemiological study housed in the Department of Surgery at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital. Individuals who met the eligibility criteria and signed informed consent provide information on hereditary conditions, family history of cancers, environmental exposures, and occupational risk factors.

30631431,"Rosacea is a common chronic inflammatory skin disease of the central facial skin and is of unknown origin. Currently, two classifications of rosacea exist that are based on either ""preformed"" clinical subtypes (erythematotelangiectatic, papulopustular, phymatous, and ocular) or patient-tailored analysis of the presented rosacea phenotype. Rosacea etiology and pathophysiology are poorly understood. However, recent findings indicate that genetic and environmental components can trigger rosacea initiation and aggravation by dysregulation of the innate and adaptive immune system. Trigger factors also lead to the release of various mediators such as keratinocytes (for example, cathelicidin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and endothelin-1), endothelial cells (nitric oxide), mast cells (cathelicidin and matrix metalloproteinases), macrophages (interferon-gamma, tumor necrosis factor, matrix metalloproteinases, and interleukin-26), and T helper type 1 (T <sub>H</sub>1) and T <sub>H</sub>17 cells. Additionally, trigger factors can directly communicate to the cutaneous nervous system and, by neurovascular and neuro-immune active neuropeptides, lead to the manifestation of rosacea lesions. Here, we aim to summarize the recent advances that preceded the new rosacea classification and address a symptom-based approach in the management of patients with rosacea."
30631396,"Autoimmune hepatitis affects patients of all ages and gender, across all geographic regions. Although still rare, its incidence and prevalence are increasing. Genetic predisposition conveyed by human leucocyte antigen is a strong risk factor for the disease and may be responsible in part for the wide variation in presentation in different geographic regions. Our understanding of the underlying pathogenic mechanisms is evolving and may lead to development of more targeted immunotherapies. Diagnosis is based on elevated levels of serum aminotransferases, gamma globulins, autoantibodies and characteristic findings on histology. Exclusion of other causes of chronic hepatitis is important. Although undiagnosed disease is associated with poor outcomes, it is readily treatable with timely immunosuppressive therapy in the majority of patients. International guidelines are available to guide management but there exists a disparity in the standard treatment regimens. This minireview aims to review the available guidelines and summarize the key recommendations involved in management of this complex autoimmune disease."
30631148,"B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL) with TCF3-PBX1 fusion gene expression has constitutively elevated levels of Wnt16b and ROR1 (receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor), a ligand and a receptor from the Wnt signaling pathway, respectively. Although survival rate is usually high after the initial chemotherapy, many TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL patients relapse and subsequently develop treatment resistance, resulting in poor prognosis. Here, we aimed to investigate the molecular signaling associated with Wnt16b and ROR1 overexpression in TCF3-PBX1 cell lines and primary samples, and to identify effective treatment options via ROR1 targeting. We detected higher ROR1 expression on TCF3-PBX1 leukemic cells even at a later stage of patient relapse, providing a strong rationale for the use of ROR1-targeted therapy. We found that Wnt5a-ROR1 signaling enhances proliferation of TCF3-PBX1 cells via RhoA/Rac1 GTPases activation and STAT3 upregulation. Wnt16b also activated the RhoA/Rac1 signaling cascade suggesting the activation of a non-canonical Wnt pathway in TCF3-PBX1 cells. Wnt16 could interact with ROR1 but not in TCF3-PBX1 cells, suggesting that Wnt5a is the ligand signaling via ROR1 in TCF3-PBX1 cells. By high throughput drug-sensitivity testing of TCF3-PBX1 cells before and after ROR1 knockdown we found that targeting ROR1 significantly improves the therapeutic efficacy of Bcl-2 family inhibitors venetoclax and navitoclax, and this synergism was confirmed ex vivo using a drug-resistant primary sample from a relapsed TCF3-PBX1 patient. Our work underlines a new type of targeted combination therapy that could be clinically advantageous for patients with TCF3-PBX1 BCP-ALL."
30631109,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) therapy show different levels of effectiveness in the context of different types of liver damage, suggesting that the microenvironment of the injured liver is a key determinant for effective stem cell therapy. The objective was to assess the modulatory effect of hepatic stem cell niche components on the transplanted MSCs during liver injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>). Superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO)-labeled human MSCs were injected intravenously into mice treated with CCl<sub>4</sub> and subjected to hepatic macrophage-depletion. Liver tissues were collected at different intervals post transplantation for subsequent histopathological, morphometric, immunohistochemical, gene expression and ultrastructural studies. The homing of the transplanted MSCs was evidenced by tracing them within the niche by iron staining and immunohistochemical studies. MSCs differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells and intimal smooth muscle cells as evidenced by their expression of human albumin and α-smooth muscle actin with a concomitant increase in the level of mouse hepatocyte growth factor. A post transplantation reduction in the liver fibro-inflammatory reaction was found and was promoted by liver macrophages depletion. Thus, it could be concluded from the present study that prior manipulation of the microenvironment is required to improve the outcome of the transplanted cells."

30631039,"CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein. When the CD44 gene is expressed, its pre-messenger RNA (mRNA) can be alternatively spliced into mature mRNAs that encode several CD44 isoforms. The mRNA assembles with ten standard exons, and the sixth variant exon encodes CD44v6, which engages in a variety of biological processes, including cell growth, apoptosis, migration, and angiogenesis. Mechanistically, CD44v6 interacts with hyaluronic acid (HA) or osteopontin, or it acts as a coreceptor for various cytokines, such as epidermal growth factor, vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and C-X-C motif chemokine 12. In this context, the receptor tyrosine kinase or G protein-coupled receptor-associated signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase and phosphoinositide-3-kinase/Akt, are activated. Using these actions, homeostasis or regeneration can be facilitated among normal tissues. However, overexpression of the mature mRNA encoding CD44v6 can induce cancer progression. For example, CD44v6 assists colorectal cancer stem cells in colonization, invasion, and metastasis. Overexpression of CD44v6 predicts poor prognosis in patients with colorectal cancer, as patients with a large number of CD44v6-positive cells in their tumors are generally diagnosed at late stages. Thus, the clinical significance of CD44v6 in colorectal cancer deserves consideration. Preclinical results have indicated satisfactory efficacies of anti-CD44 therapy among several cancers, including prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer. Moreover, clinical trials aiming to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and toxicity of a commercialized anti-CD44 monoclonal antibody developed by Roche (RO5429083) have been conducted among patients with CD44-expressing malignant tumors, and a clinical trial focusing on the dose escalation of this antibody is ongoing. Thus, we are hopeful that anti-CD44 therapy will be applied in the treatment of colorectal cancer in the future."
30630954,"After reacting with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), sickle-cell hemoglobin (HbS, βE6V) remains longer in a highly oxidizing ferryl form (HbFe<sup>4+</sup>=O) and induces irreversible oxidation of ""hotspot"" amino acids including βCys93. To control the damaging ferryl heme, here we constructed three HbS variants. The first contained a redox-active Tyr in β subunits (F41Y), a substitution present in Hb Mequon; the second contained the Asp (K82D) found in the β cleft of Hb Providence; and the third had both of these β substitutions. Both the single Tyr41 and Asp82 constructs lowered the oxygen affinity of HbS but had little or no effects on autoxidation or heme loss kinetics. In the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, both rHbS βF41Y and βF41Y/K82D enhanced ferryl Hb reduction by providing a pathway for electrons to reduce the heme via the Tyr41 side chain. MS analysis of βCys93 revealed moderate inhibition of thiol oxidation in the HbS single F41Y variant and dramatic 3- to 8-fold inhibition of cysteic acid formation in rHbS βK82D and βF41Y/K82D, respectively. Under hypoxia, βK82D and βF41Y/K82D HbS substitutions increased the delay time by approximately 250 and 600s before the onset of polymerization compared with the rHbS control and rHbS βF41Y, respectively. Moreover, at 60°C, rHbS βK82D exhibited superior structural stability. Asp82 also enhanced the function of Tyr as a redox-active amino acid in the rHbS βF41Y/K82D variant. We conclude that the βK82D and βF41Y substitutions add significant resistance to oxidative stress and anti-sickling properties to HbS and therefore could be potential genome-editing targets."

30630822,"Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a mesenchymal neoplasm characterized by activating mutations in the related receptor tyrosine kinases KIT and PDGFRA. GIST relies on expression of these unamplified receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes through a large enhancer domain, resulting in high expression levels of the oncogene required for tumor growth. Although kinase inhibition is an effective therapy for many GIST patients, disease progression from kinase resistance mutations is common and no other effective classes of systemic therapy exist. In this study, we identify regulatory regions of the KIT enhancer essential for KIT gene expression and GIST cell viability. Given the dependence of GIST upon enhancer-driven expression of RTKs, we hypothesized that the enhancer domains could be therapeutically targeted by a BET bromodomain inhibitor (BBI). Treatment of GIST cells with BBIs led to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cell death, with unique sensitivity in GIST cells arising from attenuation of the KIT enhancer domain and reduced KIT gene expression. BBI treatment in KIT-dependent GIST cells produced genome-wide changes in the H3K27ac enhancer landscape and gene expression program, which was also seen with direct KIT inhibition using a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). Combination treatment with BBI and TKI led to superior cytotoxic effects in vitro and in vivo, with BBI preventing tumor growth in TKI-resistant xenografts. Resistance to select BBI in GIST was attributable to drug efflux pumps. These results define a therapeutic vulnerability and clinical strategy for targeting oncogenic kinase dependency in GIST."
30630736,"Depletion of the cholesterol esterifying enzyme acyl-Coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2, encoded by Soat2) protects mice from atherosclerosis, diet-induced hypercholesterolemia, and hepatic steatosis when fed high-cholesterol diet. The glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) represents the main gate of glucose uptake by the liver. Lipid synthesis from glucose (de novo lipogenesis; DNL) plays a pivotal role in the development of hepatic steatosis. Inhibition of DNL is a successful approach to reverse hepatic steatosis, as shown by different studies in mice and humans. Here we aimed to investigate whether depletion of Soat2 per se can reduce hepatic steatosis, also in the presence of very low levels of cholesterol in the diet, and the underlying mechanisms. Female Soat2-/- and wild type mice were either fed high-fat or high-carbohydrate diet and both contained <0.05% (w/w) cholesterol. Analysis in serum, liver, muscles and adipose tissues were performed. We found Soat2-/- mice fed high-fat, low-cholesterol diet to have less hepatic steatosis, decreased expression of genes involved in DNL and lower hepatic GLUT2. Similar findings were found in Soat2-/- mice fed high-carbohydrate, low-cholesterol diet. CONCLUSION: Depletion of Soat2 reduces hepatic steatosis independently of the presence of high levels of cholesterol in the diet. Our study provides a link between hepatic cholesterol esterification, DNL, and GLUT2."

30630325,"The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in developed countries increases every year. The aetiology is still not completely understood and its clarification is a key prerequisite for effective prophylaxis and therapy. IBD is most-likely caused by a combination of several factors: environmental, genetic, immunological, and disruption of intestinal microbiota composition - dysbiosis. ""Westernization"" of lifestyle and urbanization seem to be among the most serious environmental factors. The pathogenesis is also influenced by the imbalance between the TH1 and TH2 cellular response and the expression of genes involved in T cell response and immunodeficiency. Last but not least, the worldwide overuse of antimicrobial drugs depletes the microbiome, which has a direct impact on the development of the dysbiosis. The subject of this review is a detailed characterization of the above-mentioned factors involved in the onset and development of IBD. Key words: gut microbiota inflammatory bowel disease immunopathogenesis dysbiosis."
30630245,"<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the clinical features, diagnosis and differential diagnosis of diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis (DPM), a rare subtype of minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules (MPMN), so as to improve the understanding of this disorder. <b>Methods:</b> The clinical data of a patient diagnosed as DPM admitted in department of Respiratory Medicine, Peking University Third Hospital in August 2016 were reported and the related literatures were reviewed. With ""pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules"" , ""minute pulmonary meningothelial-like nodules"" or ""diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis"" as the search terms, and the search time before November 1st 2017 for Wanfangdata, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and PubMed.Twenty-five articles were retrieved, among which 6 English (all case reports) articles were found with the search term ""diffuse pulmonary meningotheliomatosis"" involving 10 cases, and the other 19 articles (1 Chinese, 18 English) about MPMN mainly discussed non-DPM cases,including 13 case reports and 6 pathological/genetic studies. <b>Results:</b> A 68-year old female was admitted to the hospital because of intermittent cough and expectoration for more than 3 years and aggravation for 3 weeks. Her pulmonary CT showed diffuse minute nodules distributed randomly throughout both lungs, and did not improve after treatment with oral Moxifloxacin for 2 weeks. A video-assisted thoracoscopic biopsy was performed. The specimens showed MPMN and no other lesions, which confirmed the final diagnosis of DPM. She was followed without any medication therapy and her pulmonary CT showed stabilization of the lesions one year later. DPM was considered as a rare type of MPMN. A total of 11 cases were analyzed, including 10 cases reported in the literature. The patients included 1man and 10 women, aged 51 to 75 years, with an average age of (64±8) years. Among the 11 patients, 8 denied a history of smoking or of occupational exposure, 7 presented with dyspnea, shortness of breath, or fatigue, and 8 had mild abnormalities of pulmonary function test. The pulmonary CT of all the patients showed randomly distributed, diffuse bilateral small solid or ground-glass nodules, with the diameters less than 5 millimeters, some of which were cavitated. Only 1 patient had pulmonary thromboembolism, while the other 10 did not have any other lung diseases. All the patients were histologically diagnosed, 8 by open lung biopsies, 2 by transbronchial lung biopsy, and 1 by CT-guided fine needle aspiration. Three patients were followed for 12-92 months and the lung lesions were all stable. <b>Conclusions:</b> As a rare subtype of MPMN, DPM lacks specificity of clinical manifestations, and presents with diffuse bilateral small solid or ground-glass nodules, distributed randomly throughout both lungs. An early correct diagnosis depends on biopsy."
30630170,"In-depth knowledge of the mechanisms induced by early postischemic cardiac endogenous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the acutely ischemic heart could advance our understanding of cardiac regeneration. Herein, we aimed to identify, isolate, and initially characterize the origin, kinetics and fate of cardiac MSCs. This was facilitated by in vivo genetic cell fate mapping through green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression under the control of vimentin induction after acute myocardial infarction (MI). Following permanent ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in CreER+ mTom/mGFP+ mice, vimentin/GFP+ cells revealed ischemia-responsive activation, survival, and local enrichment inside the peri-infarction border zone. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-isolated vimentin/GFP+ cells could be strongly expanded in vitro with clonogenic precursor formation and revealed MSC-typical cell morphology. Flow-cytometric analyses demonstrated an increase in cardiac vimentin/GFP+ cells in the ischemic heart, from a 0.6% cardiac mononuclear cell (MNC) fraction at 24 h to 1.6% at 72 h following MI. Sca-1+CD45- cells within the vimentin/GFP+ subtype of this MNC fraction increased from 35.2% at 24 h to 74.6% at 72 h after MI. The cardiac postischemic vimentin/GFP+ MNC subtype showed multipotent adipogenic, chondrogenic, and osteogenic differentiation potential, which is distinctive for MSCs. In conclusion, we demonstrated a seemingly proliferative first response of vimentin- induced cardiac endogenous MSCs in the acutely ischemic heart. Genetically, GFP-targeted in vivo cell tracking, isolation, and in vitro expansion of this cardiac MSC subtype could help to clarify their reparative status in inflammation, fibrogenesis, cell turnover, tissue homeostasis, and myocardial regeneration."
30629980,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a devastating diagnosis with, however, potential for an extremely intriguing aesthetic component. Despite motor and cognitive deficits, an emerging collection of studies report a burst of visual artistic output and alterations in produced art in a subgroup of patients. This provides a unique window into the neurophysiological bases for why and how we might create and enjoy visual art, as well as into general brain function and the nature of PD or other neurodegenerative diseases. However, there has not been a comprehensive organization of literature on this topic. Nor has there been an attempt to connect case evidence and knowledge on PD with present understanding of visual art making in psychology and neuroaesthetics in order to propose hypotheses for documented artistic changes. Here, we collect the current research on this topic, tie this to PD symptoms and neurobiology, and provide new theories focusing on dopaminergic neuron damage, over-stimulation from dopamine agonist therapy, and context or genetic factors revealing the neurobiological basis of the visual artistic brain."
30629775,"Despite much theory about how genetic counseling facilitates prenatal decision-making, there are limited data regarding patients' perceptions of the process and the role of the genetic counselor (GC). Our aim in this study was to explore patients' perceptions of their prenatal genetic counseling session, with a focus on their relationship with their GC and how factors inside and outside the session influenced their decision-making about amniocentesis. We performed a qualitative study with patients who had seen a GC after maternal serum screening revealed an increased risk for aneuploidy. Semistructured interviews were transcribed verbatim, and analyzed using a constant comparative method. To complement and triangulate with these data, we used a secondary quantitative measure-the 6-item Satisfaction With Decision-making (SWD) scale, and questionnaires completed by participants' GCs. Eleven patients participated and four predominant themes emerged from our data: (1) being unprepared; (2) recognizing responsibility for decision-making; (3) the burden of responsibility; and (4) the impact of support through affirmation. Despite the underlying tension within these themes, patients reported high satisfaction with their decisions (SWD mean score = 28.5/30, range: 26-30). Patients perceived their GCs to be nonbiased yet supportive in the decision-making process. Patients described feeling affirmed, but not swayed in their decision."
30629437,"We report herein the discovery of highly potent PROTAC degraders of androgen receptor (AR), as exemplified by compound 34 (ARD-69). ARD-69 induces degradation of AR protein in AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines in a dose- and time-dependent manner. ARD-69 achieves DC<sub>50</sub> values of 0.86, 0.76, and 10.4 nM in LNCaP, VCaP, and 22Rv1 AR+ prostate cancer cell lines, respectively. ARD-69 is capable of reducing the AR protein level by >95% in these prostate cancer cell lines and effectively suppressing AR-regulated gene expression. ARD-69 potently inhibits cell growth in these AR-positive prostate cancer cell lines and is >100 times more potent than AR antagonists. A single dose of ARD-69 effectively reduces the level of AR protein in xenograft tumor tissue in mice. Further optimization of ARD-69 may ultimately lead to a new therapy for AR+, castration-resistant prostate cancer."
30629309,"Malignant tumors originate from somatic mutations and other genomic and epigenomic alterations, which lead to loss of control of the cellular circuitry. These alterations present patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity that can influence prognosis and modify response to drugs, highlighting the need for multitargeted therapies. Studies in this area have generally focused in particular malignancies and considered whole genes instead of specific mutations, ignoring the fact that different alterations in the same gene can have widely different effects. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of co-dependencies of individual somatic mutations in the whole spectrum of human tumors. Combining multitesting with conditional and expected mutational probabilities, we have discovered rules governing the codependencies of driver and nondriver mutations. We also uncovered pairs and networks of comutations and exclusions, some of them restricted to certain cancer types and others widespread. These pairs and networks are not only of basic but also of clinical interest, and can be of help in the selection of multitargeted antitumor therapies. In this respect, recurrent driver comutations suggest combinations of drugs that might be effective in the clinical setting, while recurrent exclusions indicate combinations unlikely to be useful."
30629188,"Transplantation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) is a promising way for treating demyelinating diseases. However, generation of scalable and autologous sources of OPCs has proven difficult. We previously established a chemical condition M9 that could specifically initiate neural program in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Here we found that M9 could induce the formation of colonies that undergo mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition at the early stage of reprogramming. These colonies may represent unstable and neural lineage-restricted intermediates that have not established a neural stem cell identity. By modulating the culture signaling recapitulating the principle of OPC development, these intermediate cells could be reprogrammed towards OPC fate. The chemical-induced OPC-like cells (ciOPLCs) resemble primary neural stem cell-derived OPCs in terms of their morphology, gene expression, and the ability of self-renewal. Upon differentiation, ciOPLCs could produce functional oligodendrocytes and myelinate the neuron axons in vitro, validating their OPC identity molecularly and functionally. Therefore, our study provides a non-integrating approach to OPC reprogramming that may ultimately provide an avenue to patient-specific cell-based or in situ regenerative therapy."
30628773,"Cytosolic delivery of functional siRNA remains the major challenge to develop siRNA based therapeutics. Designing clinically safe and effective siRNA transporter to deliver functional siRNA across the plasma and endosomal membrane remains a key hurdle. With the aim of improving endosomal release, we have designed cyclic and linear peptide based transporters having Arg-DHis-Arg template. Computational studies show that Arg-DHis-Arg template is also stabilized by Arg-His side-chain hydrogen bonding interaction at physiological pH, which dissociates at lower pH. The overall atomistic interactions were examined by molecular dynamics simulations, which indicate that extent of peptide-siRNA assembly formation depends greatly on physicochemical properties of the peptides. Our designed peptides having Arg-DHis-Arg template and two lipidic moieties facilitate high yield of intracellular delivery of siRNA. Additionally, unsaturated lipid, linoleic acid moieties were introduced to promote fusogenicity and facilitate endosomal release and cytosolic delivery. Interestingly, such protease-resistant peptides provide serum stability to siRNA and exhibit high efficacy of erk1 and erk2 gene silencing in triple negative breast cancer cell line. The peptide having two linoleyl moieties demonstrated comparable efficacy with commercial transfection reagent HiPerFect, as evidenced by erk1 and erk2 gene knockdown experiment. Additionally, our study shows that ERK1/2 silencing siRNA and doxorubicin loaded gramicidin mediated combination therapy is more effective than siRNA mediated gene silencing based monotherapy for ""Triple negative"" breast cancer (TNBC) treatment."

30628682,"Gastric cancer (GC) is the fourth most frequently occurring cancer and the second most common cause of cancer‑associated mortality worldwide. An increasing number of studies have reported that microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) contribute to the regulation of GC development and progression. Therefore, investigation of the miRNAs involved in the development of GC may result in identification of an effective therapeutic target for patients with this malignancy. miR‑18b has been reported to be aberrantly expressed in several types of human cancer. However, the expression pattern, biological role and specific functional mechanism of miR‑18b in GC remains to be elucidated. In the present study, reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) analysis revealed that miR‑18b was significantly upregulated in GC tissues and cell lines compared with normal gastric tissues and the human gastric epithelial immortalized cell line GES‑1, respectively. High miR‑18b expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis, invasive depth and the Tumor Node Metastasis stage of patients with GC. Additionally, functional assays indicated that the inhibition of miR‑18b attenuated cell proliferation and invasion in GC. Furthermore, Kruppel‑like factor (KLF)‑6 was identified as a direct target gene of miR‑18b in GC, from the results of bioinformatics analysis, a luciferase reporter assay, RT‑qPCR and western blot analysis. An inverse association was observed between miR‑18b and KLF6 mRNA levels in GC tissues. KLF6 knockdown partially abrogated the effects of miR‑18b inhibition on GC cell proliferation and invasion. Therefore, miR‑18b/KLF6 targeted therapy may provide a promising treatment for patients with GC."
30628637,"Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRs) is implicated in the carcinogenesis of various types of malignant tumor by manipulating cell growth and apoptosis. Abnormal expression of miR‑320a is involved in tumorigenesis of many types of cancer. The potential association of miR‑320a and the possible regulatory mechanisms in endometrial carcinoma is rarely elucidated. In the present study, it was demonstrated that miR‑320a expression was decreased in endometrial carcinoma tissues and cell lines. The present results also indicated that overexpression of miR‑320a suppressed cell proliferation through inducing G2/M phrase arrest and apoptosis. Insulin‑like growth factor receptror‑1 (IGF‑1R) was verified to be the potential target of miR‑320a by computational analysis and luciferase reporter assays. In addition, overexpression of miR‑320a reduced endogenous IGF‑1R expression in cells. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that upregulation of miR‑320a inhibited phosphorylated (p)‑protein kinase B and p‑mechanistic target of rapamycin activation and promoted B cell lymphoma‑2‑associated death promoter expression. Reintroduction of IGF‑1R into miR‑320a‑overexpressed cells antagonized the impact of miR‑320a on its downstream protein, which demonstrated that the tumor suppressive role of miR‑320a in endometrial carcinoma is exerted by the signal pathway mediated by IGF‑1R. It was therefore concluded that miR‑320a served an anti‑tumor role on endometrial carcinoma through the regulation of IGF‑1R, and miR‑320a may be used as the target for the gene therapy of endometrial carcinoma."

30627698,"<b>Background:</b> Shark new antigen receptor variable domain (V<sub>NAR</sub>) antibodies can bind restricted epitopes that may be inaccessible to conventional antibodies. <b>Methods:</b> Here, we developed a library construction method based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-Extension Assembly and Self-Ligation (named ""EASeL"") to construct a large V<sub>NAR</sub> antibody library with a size of 1.2 × 10<sup>10</sup> from six naïve adult nurse sharks (<i>Ginglymostoma cirratum</i>). <b>Results:</b> The next-generation sequencing analysis of 1.19 million full-length V<sub>NAR</sub>s revealed that this library is highly diversified because it covers all four classical V<sub>NAR</sub> types (Types I-IV) including 11% of classical Type I and 57% of classical Type II. About 30% of the total V<sub>NAR</sub>s could not be categorized as any of the classical types. The high variability of complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 length and cysteine numbers are important for the diversity of V<sub>NAR</sub>s. To validate the use of the shark V<sub>NAR</sub> library for antibody discovery, we isolated a panel of V<sub>NAR</sub> phage binders to cancer therapy-related antigens, including glypican-3, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and programmed cell death-1 (PD1). Additionally, we identified binders to viral antigens that included the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) spike proteins. The isolated shark single-domain antibodies including Type I and Type II V<sub>NAR</sub>s were produced in <i>Escherichia coli</i> and validated for their antigen binding. A Type II V<sub>NAR</sub> (PE38-B6) has a high affinity (K<sub>d</sub> = 10.1 nM) for its antigen. <b>Conclusions:</b> The naïve nurse shark V<sub>NAR</sub> library is a useful source for isolating single-domain antibodies to a wide range of antigens. The EASeL method may be applicable to the construction of other large diversity gene expression libraries."

Natural history studies of choroideremia have provided additional insight into the clinical phenotype of the condition and prepared the way for clinical trials aiming to investigate the safety and efficacy of suitable therapies. In this review, we provide a summary of the current knowledge on the genetics, pathophysiology, clinical features and therapeutic strategies that might become available for choroideremia in the future, including gene therapy, stem cell treatment and small-molecule drugs with nonsense suppression action."
30627460,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is an aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma typically expressing CD19, CD20, CD5, FMC-7, CyclinD1, and SOX-11 and harboring the IgH/CCND1 translocation. We report a blastoid variant of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) involving an inguinal lymph node that, in addition to classical phenotypic and genetic findings, also aberrantly coexpresses surface CD10 and cytoplasmic CD3. Small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) was also present in the same lymph node and in the bone marrow. B- and T-cell gene rearrangement studies by PCR show the MCL and SLL to be clonally related. Expression of multiple aberrant antigens and concurrent lymphomas of different classifications can cause a diagnostic challenge. Awareness of such a presentation and integration of the data from morphologic evaluation, flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, and FISH studies is required for proper diagnosis, prognosis, and therapy."
30627435,"Insulin autoimmune syndrome is an unusual cause of spontaneous hypoglycaemia in non-Asian populations. In the majority of cases, this syndrome appears a few weeks after the administration of drugs containing a sulfhydryl group. A strong association between this syndrome and HLA-DR4 has been shown. Only seven cases have been described in non-Asian patients. We report the first case of insulin autoimmune syndrome in an Argentine woman taking alfa-lipoic acid. She developed hypoglycaemic symptoms approximately 1 month after starting therapy. Blood sampling collected during an episode of symptomatic hypoglycaemia showed low blood glucose level (2.39 mmol/L), high level of serum insulin (1971.55 pmol/L), inappropriately high level of C-peptide (2.36 nmol/L) and high levels of insulin antibodies (274.78 IU/mL). HLA-DNA typing identified DRB1*04:03. Due to the widespread use of alfa-lipoic acid for its antioxidant properties, clinicians should be aware that it may trigger an autoimmune hypoglycaemia in people with a genetic predisposition."
30627171,"There is still much to learn about the cells used for cell- and gene-based therapies in the clinical setting. Stem cells are found in virtually all tissues in the human body. As a result, cells isolated from these tissues are a heterogeneous population consisting of various subpopulations including stem cells. Several strategies have been used to isolate and define the subpopulations that constitute these heterogeneous populations, one of which is the side population (SP) assay. SP cells are identified by their ability to efflux a fluorescent dye at a rate that is greater than the main cell population. This elevated rate of dye efflux has been attributed to the expression of members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter protein family. SP cells have been identified in various tissues. In this review, we discuss the research to date on SP cells, focussing on SP cells identified in haematopoietic stem cells, adipose-derived stromal cells, and dental pulp."
30626792,"A 17-year-old woman was urgently transported to our hospital due to consciousness disturbance. A blood examination revealed intracerebral hemorrhage, WBC 233,800/l, blasts 93%, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. The results of bone-marrow aspiration indicated acute myeloid leukemia (M2 in FAB classification) with t (7;11) (p15;p15) and the resulting chimeric gene NUP98-HOXA9 and with FLT3-ITD. Following hematoma evacuation, induction therapy was initiated and the leukocytes in the cerebrospinal fluid observed in the spinal drainage were monitored. Because they increased on days 5 and 9 after the completion of induction therapy, intrathecal chemotherapy (IT) was performed; this finally contributed to controlling AML in the central nervous system (CNS), together with the restoration of normal hematopoiesis. Subsequently, after complete molecular remission with consolidation therapies containing high-dose cytarabine, a bone-marrow transplantation with a myeloablative regimen was conducted from a 1-allele mismatched sibling donor. Finally, the patient was discharged without major sequela on day 228 after the first visit. The management of CNS disease in AML with intracerebral hemorrhage remains unclear. Our case suggests that IT at the appropriate time based on the monitored number of cerebrospinal fluid leukocytes could be useful in controlling AML in the CNS after intracerebral hemorrhage."
30626755,"Psoralen plus UVA (PUVA) is an effective therapy for mycosis fungoides (MF), the skin-limited variant of cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL). In low-burden patients, PUVA reduced or eradicated malignant T cells and induced clonal expansion of CD8+ T cells associated with malignant T cell depletion. High-burden patients appeared to clinically improve but large numbers of malignant T cells persisted in skin. Clinical improvement was linked to turnover of benign T cell clones but not to malignant T cell reduction. Benign T cells were associated with the Th2-recruiting chemokine CCL18 before therapy and with the Th1-recruiting chemokines CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 after therapy, suggesting a switch from Th2 to Th1. Inflammation was correlated with OX40L and CD40L gene expression; immunostaining localized these receptors to CCL18-expressing c-Kit+ dendritic cells that clustered together with CD40+OX40+ benign and CD40+CD40L+ malignant T cells, creating a proinflammatory synapse in skin. Our data suggest that visible inflammation in CTCL results from the recruitment and activation of benign T cells by c-Kit+OX40L+CD40L+ dendritic cells and that this activation may provide tumorigenic signals. Targeting c-Kit, OX40, and CD40 signaling may be novel therapeutic avenues for the treatment of MF."
30626753,"Incidence of HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) has been increasing dramatically. Although long-term survival rates for these patients are high, they often suffer from permanent radiotherapy-related morbidity. This has prompted the development of de-escalation clinical protocols to reduce morbidity. However, a subset of patients do not respond even to standard therapy and have poor outcomes. It is unclear how to properly identify and treat the high- and low-risk HPV+ OPSCC patients. Since HPV positivity drives radiotherapy sensitivity, we hypothesized that variations in HPV biology may cause differences in treatment response and outcome. By analyzing gene expression data, we identified variations in HPV-related molecules among HPV+ OPSCC. A subset of tumors presented a molecular profile distinct from that of typical HPV+ tumors and exhibited poor treatment response, indicating molecular and clinical similarities with HPV- tumors. These molecular changes were also observed in vitro and correlated with radiation sensitivity. Finally, we developed a prognostic biomarker signature for identification of this subgroup of HPV+ OPSCC and validated it in independent cohorts of oropharyngeal and cervical carcinomas. These findings could translate to improved patient stratification for treatment deintensification and new therapeutic approaches for treatment-resistant HPV-related cancer."
30626740,"Medulloblastoma (MB) is the most prevalent malignant brain tumor in children, accounting for 20% of all childhood brain tumors. The molecular profiling of MB into 4 major subgroups (WNT, SHH, Grp3, and Grp4) emphasizes the heterogeneity of MB and opens paths in which treatments may be targeted to molecularly aggressive and distinct tumors. Current therapeutic strategies for Group 3 MB are challenging and can be accompanied by long-term side effects from treatment. The involvement of altered epigenetic machinery in neoplastic transformation in MB has become more evident. Thus, we performed an epigenomic RNAi and chemical screen and identified SETD8/PRE-SET7/KMT5a as a critical player in maintaining proliferation and cell survival of MB cells. We have found that inhibition of SETD8 effects the migration/invasive ability of MB cells. SETD8 alters H4K20me chromatin occupancy at key genes involved in tumor invasiveness and pluripotency. Interestingly, these results link the aggressive and metastatic behavior of MYC-driven MB with SETD8 activity. Based on our results, we suggest that SETD8 has a critical role mediating Group 3 MB tumorigenesis. Establishing a role for SETD8 as a factor in MYC-driven MB has potential to lead to more effective therapies needed to improve outcomes in high-risk patients."
30626737,"With the increase in population, there is a rise in number of cancer cases starting from young children to old people. The uncommon cancers are generally sporadic and there are no pre-defined techniques/tools for the diagnosis. Identifying the diseases at an early stage can avoid the cancerous cells from metastasis to different body parts through tissue, lymph system and blood. It is very difficult for the parents to know that the child is suffering from cancer until the cancer has reached to Stage 4. The duration it takes the cancer to reach Stage 4 can depend on many factors but the fact about childhood cancer is that it is curable to some extent. Diagnoses of the cancer at an early stage, i.e. at Stage 1, from childhood to old age can increase the survival rate of the patients by 85% and also helps to come up with certain therapy."
30626728,"Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes, three strongly interrelated diseases, are associated to increased morbidity and mortality worldwide. The pathogenesis of obesity-associated disorders is still under study. Secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular glycoprotein expressed in many cell types including adipocytes, parenchymal, and non-parenchymal hepatic cells and pancreatic cells. Studies have demonstrated that SPARC inhibits adipogenesis and promotes insulin resistance; in addition, circulating SPARC levels were positively correlated with body mass index in obese individuals. Therefore, SPARC is being proposed as a key factor in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated disorders. The aim of this study is to elucidate the role of SPARC in glucose homeostasis. We show here that SPARC null (SPARC<sup>-/-</sup>) mice displayed an abnormal insulin-regulated glucose metabolism. SPARC<sup>-/-</sup> mice presented an increased adipose tissue deposition and an impaired glucose homeostasis as animals aged. In addition, the absence of SPARC worsens high-fat diet-induced diabetes in mice. Interestingly, although SPARC<sup>-/-</sup> mice on high-fat diet were sensitive to insulin they showed an impaired insulin secretion capacity. Of note, the expression of glucose transporter 2 in islets of SPARC<sup>-/-</sup> mice was dramatically reduced. The present study provides the first evidence that deleted SPARC expression causes diabetes in mice. Thus, SPARC deficient mice constitute a valuable model for studies concerning obesity and its related metabolic complications, including diabetes."
30626678,"Interferon (IFN) production and the subsequent induction of IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) are highly effective innate strategies utilized by cells to protect against invading pathogens, including viruses. Critical components involved in this innate process are the Promyelocytic Leukemia Nuclear Bodies (PML-NBs), which are sub-nuclear structures required for the development of a robust IFN response. As such, PML-NBs serve as an important hurdle for viruses to overcome to successfully establish an infection. Both Kaposi's sarcoma-associated Herpesvirus (KSHV) and the closely related rhesus macaque rhadinovirus (RRV) are unique for encoding viral homologues to IFN regulatory factors (termed vIRFs) that can manipulate the host immune response by multiple mechanisms. All four KSHV vIRFs inhibit the induction of IFN while vIRF1 and vIRF2 can inhibit ISG induction downstream of the IFN receptor. Less is known about the RRV vIRFs. RRV vIRF R6 can inhibit the induction of IFN by IRF3, however, it is not known whether any RRV vIRFs inhibit ISG induction following IFN receptor signaling. In our current study we demonstrate that the RRV vIRF R12 aids viral replication in the presence of the type I IFN response. This is achieved in part through the disruption of PML-NBs and the inhibition of robust ISG transcription.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> KSHV and RRV encode a unique set of homologs to cellular IFN regulatory factors, termed vIRFs, which are hypothesized to help these viruses evade the innate immune response and establish infections in their respective hosts. Our work elucidates the role of one RRV vIRF, R12, and demonstrates that RRV can dampen the type I IFN response downstream of IFN signaling which would be important for establishing a successful infection in vivo."

30626494,"Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients, but no specific therapeutic strategy is effective clinically, despite recent achievements. HCMV-specific T-cell therapy was thought to be helpful for the management of HCMV infection. To conduct a deep exploration, we investigated the possibility of engineering peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects with specific T-cell receptor (TCR) genes. CD8-positive T cells that specifically bind to NLV pentamers could be generated by transferring TCR genes to PBMCs from immunocompetent and immunocompromised subjects. The generation of functional T cells varied among transduction of different PBMCs. The numbers of IFN-γ-secreting T cells increased significantly in immunocompetent and immunodeficient PBMCs, but were unchanged in immune-reconstituted PBMCs. TCR gene transfer is a potential therapeutic strategy for controlling HCMV infection in immunocompromised patients. The transfer of TCR genes into immunocompetent and immunodeficient PBMCs would be more meaningful in response to HCMV infection than would the transfer into immune-reconstituted PBMCs."
30626446,"Abnormal expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) has been found in almost all human tumors, providing numerous potential diagnostic biomarkers, prognostic biomarkers, and therapeutic targets."
30626427,"High-affinity tumor antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) gene is required to engineer potent T cells for therapeutic treatment of cancer patients. However, discovery of suitable therapeutic TCR genes is hampered by the fact that naturally occurring tumor antigen-specific TCRs are generally of low-affinity, and artificial modification of TCRs can mediate cross-reactivity to other antigens expressed in normal tissues. Here, we discovered a naturally occurring T-cell clone which expressed high-affinity HLA-A*02:01 (A*02)-restricted TCR against NY-ESO-1 from a patient who had NY-ESO-1-expressing ovarian tumor."
30626311,"The DNA as the depository of genetic information is a natural target for chemotherapy. A lot of anticancer and antimicrobial agents derive their biological activity from their selective interaction with DNA in the minor groove and from their ability to interfere with biological processes such as enzyme catalysis, replication and transcription. The discovery of the details of minor groove binding drugs, such as netropsin and distamycin A, oligoamides built of 4-amino-1-methylpyrrole-2-carboxylic acid residues, allowed to develop various DNA sequence-reading molecules, named lexitropsins, capable of interacting with DNA precisely, strongly and with a high specificity, and at the same time exhibiting significant cytotoxic potential. Among such compounds, lexitropsins built of carbocyclic sixmembered aromatic rings occupy a quite prominent place in drug research. This work is an attempt to present current findings in the study of carbocyclic lexitropins, their structures, syntheses and biological investigations such as DNA-binding and antiproliferative activity."
30626089,"Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is one of the most common causes of disability, affecting over 466 million people worldwide. However, prevention or therapy of SNHL has not been widely studied. Avocado oil has shown many health benefits but it has not yet been studied in regards to SNHL. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the efficacy of avocado oil on SNHL in vitro and in vivo and elucidate its mode of action. For the present study, we used enhanced functional avocado oil extract (DKB122). DKB122 led to recovery of otic hair cells in zebrafish after neomycin-induced otic cell damage. Also, DKB122 improved auditory sensory transmission function in a mouse model of noise induced-hearing loss and protected sensory hair cells in the cochlea. In addition, RNA sequencing was performed to elucidate the mechanism involved. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes showed that DKB122 protected House Ear Institute-Organ of Corti 1 (HEI-OC1) cells against neomycin-related alterations in gene expression due to oxidative stress, cytokine production and protein synthesis."
30626079,"Relapse remains a major obstacle to the survival of patients with hematologic malignancies after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with a thrombospondin type 1 motif (ADMATS13), which cleaves von Willebrand factor multimers into less active fragments, is encoded by the <i>ADAMTS13</i> gene and has a functional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2285489 (C > T). We retrospectively examined whether <i>ADAMTS13</i> rs2285489 affected the transplant outcomes in a cohort of 281 patients who underwent unrelated human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. The recipient <i>ADAMTS13</i> C/C genotype, which putatively has low inducibility, was associated with an increased relapse rate (hazard ratio [HR], 3.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25⁻7.77; <i>P</i> = 0.015), resulting in a lower disease-free survival rate in the patients with a recipient C/C genotype (HR, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.01⁻2.67; <i>P</i> = 0.045). Therefore, <i>ADAMTS13</i> rs2285489 genotyping in transplant recipients may be a useful tool for evaluating pretransplantation risks."
30626031,"Enterotoxigenic <i>Escherichia coli</i> (ETEC) are an important diarrhea-causing pathogen and are regarded as a global threat for humans and farm animals. ETEC possess several virulence factors to infect its host, including colonization factors and enterotoxins. Production of heat-stable enterotoxins (STs) by most ETEC plays an essential role in triggering diarrhea and ETEC pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the heat-stable enterotoxins of ETEC strains from different species as well as the molecular mechanisms used by these heat-stable enterotoxins to trigger diarrhea. As recently described, intestinal epithelial cells are important modulators of the intestinal immune system. Thus, we also discuss the impact of the heat-stable enterotoxins on this role of the intestinal epithelium and how these enterotoxins might affect intestinal immune cells. Finally, the latest developments in vaccination strategies to protect against infections with ST secreting ETEC strains are discussed. This review might inform and guide future research on heat-stable enterotoxins to further unravel their molecular pathogenesis, as well as to accelerate vaccine design."
30626019,"Neuroblastoma, a tumor of the sympathetic nervous system, is the most common extra-cranial neoplasm of childhood. Variables with prognostic significance in patients with neuroblastoma, including age at diagnosis, disease stage, tumor histology, <i>MYCN</i> gene amplification, tumor cell ploidy, and the presence of segmental chromosomal aberrations are utilized to classify patients based on risk of disease recurrence. Patients with non-high-risk neuroblastoma, low- and intermediate-risk categories, represent nearly half of all newly diagnosed cases. This group has an excellent event-free and overall survival with current therapy. Over time, the objective in treatment of non-high-risk neuroblastoma has been reduction of therapy intensity to minimize short- and long-term adverse events all the while maintaining excellent outcomes."

30623859,"Pilates can be an interesting rehabilitation strategy for people with multiple sclerosis (MS), since is a low-cost and attractive physical exercise modality that has shown to have beneficial effects in other neurological pathologies. For prescribing Pilates to this population, health professionals should be aware of its potential benefits, a goal that can be achieved by making available updated scientific evidence in this regard. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and a meta-analysis aimed at identifying the characteristics and methodological quality of the investigations that have studied the effects of Pilates in people affected with MS."
30623520,"Relapse into drug use is a major problem faced by recovering addicts. In humans, an intensification of the desire for the drug induced by environmental cues-incubation of drug craving-has been observed. In rodents, this phenomenon has been modeled by studying drug seeking under extinction after different times of drug withdrawal (or using a natural reinforcer). Although much progress has been made, an integrated approach simultaneously studying different drug classes and natural reward and examining different brain regions is lacking. Lewis rats were used to study the effects of cocaine, heroin, and sucrose seeking incubation on six key brain regions: the nucleus accumbens shell/core, central/basolateral amygdala, and dorsomedial/ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We analyzed PSD95 and gephyrin protein levels, gene expression of glutamatergic, GABAergic and endocannabinoid elements, and amino acid transmitter levels. The relationships between the areas studied were examined by Structural Equation Modelling. Pathways from medial prefrontal cortex and basolateral complex of the amygdala to central nucleus of the amygdala, but not to the nucleus accumbens, were identified as common elements involved in the incubation phenomenon for different substances. These results suggest a key role for the central nucleus of amygdala and its cortical and amygdalar afferences in the incubation phenomenon, and we suggest that by virtue of its regulatory effects on glutamatergic and GABAergic dynamics within amygdalar circuits, the endocannabinoid system might be a potential target to develop medications that are effective in the context of relapse."
30623407,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients should take medication such as fingolimod (FTY-720) for a long time, hence pharmaceutical effects on other neural cells such as dopaminergic cells are important. Dopaminergic cell line, BE(2)-M17, was treated by FTY-720 and then cell viability and genes involve in neurosurvival were investigated. It was disclosed that FTY-720 significantly stimulates Bcl2 overexpression. Whereas, it decreased intracellular reactive oxygen species production and cell membrane damage of dopaminergic cells. The increase in Bcl2/Bax ratio increased the cell metabolic activity and decreased propidium iodide-positive cells. Besides, FTY-720 induced the overexpression of CACNA1C, nNOS gene, and nitric oxide production. However, FTY-720 induced GABARA1 overexpression and eventually it could overcame to the cytotoxic effect of intracellular calcium. This cascade led to tyrosine hydroxylase and BDNF genes overexpression whereas FTY-720 did not change GDNF concentration in BE(2)-M17 cells. Concluding, it might be said that taking FTY-720 in MS patients did not induce adverse effect on dopaminergic cells."
30623370,"Drug resistance is a serious impediment to the treatment of cancer. The use of anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) monoclonal antibody therapies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer is guided by the presence of activating point mutations in KRAS and NRAS genes in the primary tumour. However, RAS wild-type status is still not sufficient to guarantee response to cetuximab and panitumumab, with response rates limited to 70% for combinations with multidrug chemotherapy. Therefore, additional mechanisms contributing to resistance are currently under investigation, and include genetic alterations and epigenetic mechanisms of resistance. In this regard, deregulation of miRNA expression profiles holds potential to unveil resistance and fuel the development of miRNA-based strategies to overcome EGFR-directed therapy limitations. We discuss current understanding of miRNA impact as modulators of EGFR therapy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer and the future challenge of miRNAs in circulation as powerful non-invasive tools to monitor anti-EGFR therapy response and predict resistance."
30623363,"The subgroup of colon cancer (CRC) characterized by mutation in the BRAF gene and high mutation rate in the genomic DNA sequence, known as the microsatellite instability (MSI) phenotype, accounts for roughly 10% of the patients and derives from polyps with a serrated morphology. In this review, both features are discussed with regard to therapeutic opportunities. The most prevalent cancer-associated BRAF mutation is BRAF V600E that causes constitutive activation of the pro-proliferative MAPK pathway. Unfortunately, the available BRAF-specific inhibitors had little clinical benefit for metastatic CRC patients due to adaptive MAPK reactivation. Recent contributions for the development of new combination therapy approaches to pathway inhibition will be highlighted. In addition, we review the promising role of the recently developed immune checkpoint therapy for the treatment of this CRC subtype. The MSI phenotype of this subgroup results from an inactivated DNA mismatch repair system and leads to frameshift mutations with translation of new amino acid stretches and the generation of neo-antigens. This most likely explains the observed high degree of infiltration by tumour-associated lymphocytes. As cytotoxic lymphocytes are already part of the tumour environment, their activation by immune checkpoint therapy approaches is highly promising."
30623359,"The pace of advances in the world of science have created new opportunities and insights that give us new and more understanding of our nature and environment. Among the different fields of science, new medical sciences have drawn a great deal of attention among medical science researchers and the society. The hope for finding treatments for incurable diseases and further improvement of man's health is growing thanks to new medical technologies. Among the novel medical fields that have been extensively covered by medical and academic societies are cell therapy and gene therapy that are categorized under regenerative medicine. The present paper is an attempt to introduce the prospect of a curative cell-based therapy and new cellular and gene therapy drugs that have been recently approved by FDA (food and drug administration). Cellular and gene therapy are two very close fields of regenerative medicine and sciences which their targets and applications can be discussed together. What adds to the importance of this new field of science is the possibility to translate the hope for treatment of incurable diseases into actual treatments. What follows delves deeper into this new field of science and the drugs."
30623253,"Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are promising therapeutics for specific modulation of cellular RNA function. However, ASO efficacy is compromised by inefficient intracellular delivery.

30623172,"All too often attempts to deliver improved cancer cure rates by increasing the dose of a particular treatment are not successful enough to justify the accompanying increase in toxicity and reduction in quality of life suffered by a significant number of patients. In part, this drive for using higher levels of treatment derives from the nature of the process for testing and incorporation of new protocols. Indeed, new treatment regimens must now consider the key role of immunity in cancer control, a component that has been largely ignored until very recently. The recognition that some drugs developed for cytotoxicity at higher doses can display alternative anticancer activities at lower doses including through modulation of immune responses is prompting a significant re-evaluation of treatment protocol development. Given that tumours are remarkably heterogeneous and with inherent genetic instability it is probably only the adaptive immune response with its flexibility and extensive repertoire that can rise to the challenge of effecting significant control and ultimately elimination of a patient's cancer. This article discusses some of the elements that have limited higher levels of treatment outcomes and where too much proved less effective. We explore observations that less can often be as effective, if not more effective especially with some chemotherapy regimens, and discuss how this can be exploited in combination with immunotherapies to deliver nontoxic improved tumour responses."
30623114,"Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia subtype glucokinase (GCK-HH) is caused by an activating mutation in glucokinase (GCK) and has been shown to increase β-cell death. However, the mechanism of β-cell death in GCK-HH remains poorly understood. Here, we expressed the GCK-HH V91L GCK mutant in INS-1 832/13 cells to determine the effect of the mutation on β-cell viability and the mechanisms of β-cell death. We showed that expression of the V91L GCK mutant in INS-1 832/13 cells resulted in a rapid glucose concentration-dependent loss of cell viability. At 11 mM D-glucose, INS-1 832/13 cells expressing V91L GCK showed increased cell permeability without significant increases in Annexin V staining or caspase 3/7 activation, indicating that these cells are primarily undergoing cell death via necrosis. Over-expression of SV40 large T antigen, which inhibits the p53 pathway, did not affect the V91L GCK-induced cell death. We also found that non-phosphorylatable L-glucose did not induce rapid cell death. Of note, glucose phosphorylation coincided with a 90% loss of intracellular ATP content. Thus, our data suggest that the GCK V91L mutant induces rapid necrosis in INS-1 cells through accelerated glucose phosphorylation, ATP depletion, and increased cell permeability."
30623003,"Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) has been developed as a successful vector for both basic research and human gene therapy. However, neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) against AAV capsids can abolish AAV infectivity on target cells, reducing the transduction efficacy. Absence of AAV NAb has become a prerequisite qualification for patients enrolled in gene therapy trials. Nevertheless, accurate assessment of AAV NAb has remained a challenging task. Here we developed a rapid assay based on the observations that AAV NAb inhibits rAAV binding to the host cell surface and NAb titers are negatively related to the amount of AAV genomes binding to the target cells. By quantifying the AAV genome on the target cells in the presence of anti-sera, AAV NAb titers can be accurately determined. The titer determined by this assay correlates well with the classical transduction-based assays. A major advantage of this method is that it can be carried out with a 30-min binding assay without the lengthy wait for a transduction outcome. This assay is independent of transduction performance of AAV serotype in the target cells. Therefore, the AAV cell-binding assay for NAb determination offers an alternative method for <i>in vivo</i> NAb assay."
30622947,"The purpose of the study was to determine if cycling exercise combined with (-)-epicatechin supplementation was more effective at increasing training adaptations than cycling combined with a placebo. Blood and muscle samples were obtained at rest before and after training to determine the effects of (-)-epicatechin supplementation on total serum antioxidant capacity, skeletal muscle mitochondrial protein content, and skeletal muscle myostatin gene expression. Participants (<i>n</i> = 20) completed two testing sessions separated by 4 weeks of cycle training, with supplementation of 100 mg (200 mg total daily) of (-)-epicatechin or a placebo, twice daily. Data were analyzed using a two-way mixed model ANOVA for each variable and the alpha level was set at <i>p</i> ≤ 0.05. A significant increase was observed for time for relative peak anaerobic power (<i>p</i> < 0.01), relative anaerobic capacity (<i>p</i> < 0.01), and fatigue index (<i>p</i> < 0.01). A significant increase was observed for time for absolute peak VO<sub>2</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.01) and peak power output obtained during the peak VO<sub>2</sub> test (<i>p</i> < 0.01). A significant interaction between group and time for relative peak VO<sub>2</sub> was observed (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Relative peak VO<sub>2</sub> significantly increased over time in the placebo group (<i>p</i> < 0.01), but not in the (-)-epicatechin group (<i>p</i> = 0.21). A significant increase was observed for time for total serum antioxidant capacity (<i>p</i> = 0.01). No interaction or main effect of time was observed for myostatin (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Likewise, no interaction or main effect of time was observed for cytochrome C or citrate synthase (<i>p</i> > 0.05). A significant interaction effect was observed for succinate dehydrogenase (SDH; <i>p</i> = 0.02). SDH content increased significantly for the placebo group (<i>p</i> = 0.03, partial η<sup>2</sup> = 0.59), but not for the (-)-epicatechin group (<i>p</i> = 0.81). Further, whereas no difference existed between the groups for SDH at baseline (<i>p</i> = 0.23), SDH content was significantly greater in the placebo group at the post time point (<i>p</i> = 0.01). Results indicate that (-)-epicatechin supplementation does not affect myostatin gene expression or anaerobic training adaptations but inhibits aerobic and mitochondrial SDH adaptations to cycle exercise training."
30622832,"Chronic liver diseases that inevitably lead to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and/or hepatocellular carcinoma have become a major cause of illness and death worldwide. Among them, cholangiopathies or cholestatic liver diseases comprise a large group of conditions in which injury is primarily focused on the biliary system. These include congenital diseases (such as biliary atresia and cystic fibrosis), acquired diseases (such as primary sclerosing cholangitis and primary biliary cirrhosis), and those that arise from secondary damage to the biliary tree from obstruction, cholangitis or ischaemia. These conditions are associated with a specific pattern of chronic liver injury centered on damaged bile ducts that drive the development of peribiliary fibrosis and, ultimately, biliary cirrhosis and liver failure. For most, there is no established medical therapy and, hence, these diseases remain one of the most important indications for liver transplantation. As a result, there is a major need to develop new therapies that can prevent the development of chronic biliary injury and fibrosis. This mini-review briefly discusses the pathophysiology of liver fibrosis and its progression to cirrhosis. We make a special emphasis on biliary fibrosis and current therapeutic options, such as angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (known as ACE2) over-expression in the diseased liver as a novel potential therapy to treat this condition."
30622725,"Biallelic mutations in the neuroblastoma amplified sequence (<i>NBAS</i>) gene have been reported to cause two different clinical spectra: short stature with optic nerve atrophy and Pelger-Huët anomaly (SOPH) syndrome and infantile liver failure syndrome 2 (ILFS2). Here, we describe a case of a 3-year-old Japanese boy who presented with fever-triggered recurrent acute liver failure (ALF). The clinical characteristics were considerable elevation of liver enzymes, severe coagulopathy, and acute renal failure. In addition to the liver phenotype, he had short stature and Pelger-Huët anomaly in the peripheral granulocytes. Whole-exome and Sanger sequencing of the patient and his parents revealed that he carried novel compound heterozygous missense mutations in <i>NBAS</i>, c.1018G>C (p.Gly340Arg) and c.2674 G>T (p.Val892Phe). Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues and are predicted to be highly damaging. Immunoblot analysis of the patient's skin fibroblasts showed a normal NBAS protein level but a reduced protein level of its interaction partner, p31, involved in Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum retrograde vesicular trafficking. We recommend <i>NBAS</i> gene analysis in children with unexplained fever-triggered recurrent ALF or liver dysfunction. Early antipyretic therapy may prevent further episodes of ALF."
30622568,"Myocardial infarction (MI) is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation is considered a promising approach and has made significant progress in preclinical studies and clinical trials for treating MI. However, hurdles including poor survival, retention, homing, and differentiation capacity largely limit the therapeutic effect of transplanted MSCs. Many strategies such as preconditioning, genetic modification, cotransplantation with bioactive factors, and tissue engineering were developed to improve the survival and function of MSCs. On the other hand, optimizing the hostile transplantation microenvironment of the host myocardium is also of importance. Here, we review the modifications of MSCs as well as the host myocardium to improve the efficacy of MSC-based therapy against MI."
30622557,"Caveolin-1 (<i>CAV1</i>) variants have been suggested to be associated with obesity and related metabolic disorders, but information based on human studies is limited. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the potential association between the <i>CAV1</i> rs1997623 C/A variant and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in Kuwaiti children. DNA from saliva samples collected from 1313 Kuwaiti children (mean age: 12 years) were genotyped using the TaqMan SNP genotyping assay. The classification of MetS was based on the presence/absence of four indicators; (1) central obesity, (2) elevated systolic or diastolic blood pressure, (3) low salivary high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), and (4) high salivary glucose. In this study, children with MetS scored ≥3, children in the intermediate metabolic group scored 1 or 2 and children without MetS scored 0. About one-third of the children were obese. A total of 246 children (18.7%) were classified as having MetS; 834 children (63.5%) were in the intermediate metabolic group, and 233 children (17.7%) had no indication of MetS. Obesity was highly prevalent in the MetS group (91.9%) while 26.8% of children were obese in the intermediate metabolic group. None of the children were obese in the group without MetS. Analysis of the <i>CAV1</i> rs1997623 variant revealed a significant association of the A-allele (<i>p</i> = 0.01, Odds Ratio (OR) = 1.66) and the heterozygous CA-genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.005, OR = 1.88) with MetS. Consistently, the A-allele (<i>p</i> = 0.002, OR = 1.71) and CA-genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.005, OR = 1.70) also showed significant association with the intermediate metabolic group. Furthermore, the A-allele (<i>p</i> = 0.01, OR = 1.33) and the CA-genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.008, OR = 1.55) were associated with low levels of saliva HDLC. Individuals who were heterozygous or homozygous for the variant (CA/AA) showed significantly lower levels of high HDLC compared to those harboring the CC-genotype (<i>p</i> = 0.023). Our study revealed a novel association of the <i>CAV1</i> rs1997623 variant with the MetS and with low saliva HDLC levels in young Kuwaiti children and indicated the need for further in-depth studies to unravel the role of <i>CAV1</i> gene in the genetic etiology of MetS."

30622323,"Schwannomas are peripheral nerve sheath tumors associated with three genetically distinct disease entities, namely sporadic schwannoma, neurofibromatosis type-2, and schwannomatosis. Schwannomas are associated with severe disability and in cases lead to death. The primary treatment is operative resection that itself can cause neurologic damage and is at times contra-indicated due to tumor location. Given their homogenous Schwann-lineage cellular composition, schwannomas are appealing targets for gene therapy. In the present study, we have generated an adeno-associated serotype 1 virus (AAV1)-based vector delivering N-terminal of the pyroptotic gene Gasdermin-D; (GSDMDNterm) under the control of the Schwann-cell specific promoter, P0. we have demonstrated that AAV1-P0-GSDMDNterm injection into intra-sciatic schwannomas reduces the growth of these tumors and resolves tumor-associated pain without causing neurologic damage. This AAV1-P0-GSDMDNterm vector holds promise for clinical treatment of schwannomas via direct intra-tumoral injection."
30622322,"The concept of using viruses to treat cancer has now shown proof of concept in several recent clinical trials, leading to the first FDA approval of virotherapy for melanoma last year. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) is a promising oncolytic virus that has inhibitory effects on a number of cancer types including non-small cell lung cancer. One of the major mechanisms of resistance to VSV infection is the type I interferon (IFN) response, leading to the development of VSV expressing IFNβ which will lead to resistance of viral replication in normal cells which have intact IFN signaling but allow replication in cancer cells with defective IFNβ signaling. However, some cancer cells have intact or partially intact IFN signaling pathways leading to resistance to virotherapy. Here we utilized JAK/STAT inhibitor, ruxolitinib, in combination with VSV-IFNβ to see if inhibition of JAK/STAT signaling will enhance VSV-IFNβ therapy for lung cancer. We used five human and two murine NSCLC cell lines in vitro, and the combination treatment was assayed for cytotoxicity. We performed western blots on treated cells to see the effects of ruxolitinib on JAK/STAT signaling and PDL-1 expression in treated cells. Finally, the combination of VSV-IFNβ and ruxolitinib was tested in an immune competent murine model of NSCLC. Ruxolitinib enhanced virotherapy in resistant and sensitive NSCLC cells. The addition of ruxolitinib inhibited STAT1 phosphorylation and to a lesser extent STAT3 phosphorylation. Ruxolitinib treatment prevented NSCLC cells from enhancing PDL-1 expression in response to virotherapy. Combination ruxolitinib and VSV-IFNβ therapy resulted in a trend toward improved survival of mice without substantially effecting PDL-1 levels or levels of immune infiltration into the tumor. These results support further clinical evaluation of the combination of JAK/STAT inhibition with virotherapy."
30622281,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a whole-joint disease characterized by cartilage destruction and other whole-joint pathological changes. There is currently no effective disease-modifying therapy. Here we investigate the post-transcriptional mRNA regulation of OA-modulating proteins in chondrocytes and show that the ZFP36 family member, ZFP36L1, is specifically upregulated in OA chondrocytes and OA cartilage of humans and mice. Adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ZFP36L1 alone in mouse knee-joint tissue does not modulate OA pathogenesis. However, genetic ablation or silencing of Zfp36l1 significantly abrogates experimental OA in mice. Knockdown of Zfp36l1 increases the mRNA expression of two heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) family members, which act as its direct targets. Furthermore, overexpression of HSPA1A in joint tissues protects mice against experimental OA by inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis. Our results indicate that the RNA-binding protein, ZFP36L1, regulates HSP70 family members that appear to protect against OA pathogenesis by inhibiting chondrocyte apoptosis."
30622239,"Liver cirrhosis results from chronic hepatic damage and is characterized by derangement of the organ architecture with increased liver fibrogenesis and defective hepatocellular function. It frequently evolves into progressive hepatic insufficiency associated with high mortality unless liver transplantation is performed. We have hypothesized that the deficiency of critical nutrients such as essential omega-3 fatty acids might play a role in the progression of liver cirrhosis. Here we evaluated by LC-MS/MS the liver content of omega-3 docosahexaenoic fatty acid (DHA) in cirrhotic patients and investigated the effect of DHA in a murine model of liver injury and in the response of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (the main producers of collagen in the liver) to pro-fibrogenic stimuli. We found that cirrhotic livers exhibit a marked depletion of DHA and that this alteration correlates with the progression of the disease. Administration of DHA exerts potent anti-fibrogenic effects in an acute model of liver damage. Studies with HSCs show that DHA inhibits fibrogenesis more intensely than other omega-3 fatty acids. Data from expression arrays revealed that DHA blocks TGFβ and NF-κB pathways. Mechanistically, DHA decreases late, but not early, SMAD3 nuclear accumulation and inhibits p65/RelA-S536 phosphorylation, which is required for HSC survival. Notably, DHA increases ADRP expression, leading to the formation of typical quiescence-associated perinuclear lipid droplets. In conclusion, a marked depletion of DHA is present in the liver of patients with advanced cirrhosis. DHA displays anti-fibrogenic activities on HSCs targeting NF-κB and TGFβ pathways and inducing ADPR expression and quiescence in these cells."
30622109,"A hallmark of chronic HBV (cHBV) infection is the presence of impaired HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. Functional T cell exhaustion induced by persistent antigen stimulation is considered a major mechanism underlying this impairment. However, due to their low frequencies in chronic infection, it is currently unknown whether HBV-specific CD8+ T cells targeting different epitopes are similarly impaired and share molecular profiles indicative of T cell exhaustion."
30622053,"Tuberous sclerosis is caused by mutations in the TSC1 or TSC2 gene and characterized by development of tumors in multiple organs including the kidneys. TSC-associated tumors exhibit somatic loss of the second allele of the TSC genes, leading to aberrant activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. Activation of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) causes addiction to glucose and glutamine in Tsc1<sup>-/-</sup>or Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Blocking of glutamine anaplerosis in combination with glycolytic inhibition causes significant cell death in Tsc2<sup>-/-</sup> but not Tsc2<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs. In this study, we tested efficacy of dual inhibition of glycolysis with 3-BrPA and glutaminolysis with CB-839 for renal tumors in Tsc2<sup>+/-</sup> mice. Following 2 months of treatment of Tsc2<sup>+/-</sup> mice from the age of 12 months, combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 significantly reduced overall size and cellular areas of all renal lesions (cystic/papillary adenomas and solid carcinomas), but neither alone did. Combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 inhibited mTORC1 and the proliferation of tumor cells but did not increase apoptosis. However, combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839 was not as efficacious as rapamycin alone or rapamycin in combination with either 3-BrPA or CB-839 for renal lesions of Tsc2<sup>+/-</sup> mice. Consistently, rapamycin alone or rapamycin in combination with either 3-BrPA or CB-839 had stronger inhibitory effects on mTORC1 and proliferation of tumor cells than combination of 3-BrPA and CB-839. We conclude that combination of 3-BRPA and CB-839 may not offer a better therapeutic strategy than rapamycin for TSC-associated tumors."
30622047,"Self-referential processing is critical to understanding social anxiety disorder (SAD). This study examined neural differences in self-referential processing in healthy controls (HC) and participants with SAD at pre- and post-treatment. Participants (n = 64) underwent fMRI scanning while viewing a video of themselves (""Self"") or another person (""Other""). SAD participants were randomized to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), or waitlist, and were re-scanned at post-treatment. In SAD vs. HC, the fusiform face area (FFA) showed significantly more activation during Self vs. Other, and greater SAD severity was associated with significantly more activation during Self vs. Other in the right FFA and the left extrastriate body area (EBA). Greater reduction in SAD severity was associated with stronger connectivity between the amygdala and FFA during Self vs. Other at post-treatment, whereas the strength of connectivity during Self and Other was comparable at post-treatment for those with less SAD reduction. Thus, there were significant differences in activation and functional connectivity of brain regions implicated in self-referential processing in SAD. Change in connectivity between the amygdala and FFA were observed as a function of change in SAD severity, suggesting that improvements in SAD severity may correct this altered functional connectivity."
30622045,"Risk of high grade gliomas is lower in young females and its incidence enhances after menopause suggesting likely protective roles of female hormones. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was widely employed to treat osteoporosis and some epidemiological studies showed that HRT regimes including progesterone analogs such as medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) decreased risk of glial tumors. Tibolone is a unique progesterone analog employed in HRT with tissue specific estrogenic effects and stimulates gene expressions very similar to those induced by MPA. Tibolone's pro-estrogenic effects occur particularly in bone and brain and both MPA and tibolone inhibit AKR1C enzymes, which involve in temozolomide chemoresistance. Hence, we aimed to investigate interactions between MPA, tibolone and temozolomide in modification of glioma cell growth and fine structure."

30621738,"Previous gain-of-function studies using an optogenetic technique showed that manipulation of the hippocampal dentate gyrus or CA1 cell ensembles is important for memory reactivation and to generate synthetic or false memory. However, gain-of-function study manipulating CA3 cell ensembles has not been reported. The CA3 area of the hippocampus comprises a recurrent excitatory circuit, which is thought to be important for the generation of associations among the stored information within one brain region. We investigated whether the coincident firing of cell ensembles in one brain region, hippocampal CA3, associates distinct events. CA3 cell ensembles responding to context exploration and during contextual fear conditioning were labeled with channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2)-mCherry. The synchronous activation of these ensembles induced freezing behavior in mice in a neutral context, in which a foot shock had never been delivered. The recall of this artificial associative fear memory was context specific. In vivo electrophysiological recordings showed that 20-Hz optical stimulation of ChR2-mCherry-expressing CA3 neurons, which is the same stimulation protocol used in behavioral experiment, induced long-term potentiation at CA3-CA3 synapses. Altogether, these results demonstrate that the synchronous activation of ensembles in one brain region, CA3 of the hippocampus, is sufficient for the association of distinct events. The results of our electrophysiology potentially suggest that this artificial association of memory events might be induced by the strengthening of synaptic efficacy between CA3 ensembles via recurrent circuit."

30621694,"Trastuzumab resistance followed by metastasis is a major obstacle for improving the clinical outcome of patients with advanced human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER-2+) breast cancer. While long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can modulate cell behavior, the contribution of these RNAs in trastuzumab resistance and metastasis of HER-2+ breast cancer is not well known. In this study, we sought to identify the regulatory role of lncRNA in trastuzumab resistance and accompanied Epithelial-mesenchymal Transition (EMT) process in advanced HER-2+ breast cancer."

30621600,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic complex disease of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with IBD can experience a wide range of symptoms, but the pathophysiological mechanisms that cause these individual differences in clinical presentation remain largely unknown. In consequence, IBD is currently classified into subtypes using clinical characteristics. If we are to develop a more targeted treatment approach, molecular subtypes of IBD need to be discovered that can be used as new drug targets. To achieve this, we need multiple layers of molecular data generated from the same IBD patients."
30621566,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs) have got immense importance as promising drugs for cancer treatment as these inhibitors regulate cellular differentiation, gene expression, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. The current study investigates the effect of the hybrid-polar HDACI m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide (CBHA) on the growth of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma, using the cell line MIA PaCa-2 as an in vitro model."
30621565,"Atherosclerosis is a chronic arterial disease characterized by vascular inflammation, accumulation of lipids in the arterial wall, and formation and growth of atherosclerotic plaques followed by ischemia. In subclinical atherosclerosis, cholesterol retention in subendothelial cells leads to induction of local inflammation, generation of foam cells and lesion formation, followed by a chain of other pathogenic events. Atherosclerotic progression can frequently be fatal, since plaque rupture may lead to thrombosis and acute events, such as myocardial infarction, stroke and sudden death. Traditional anti-atherosclerotic therapy is mainly focused on improving blood lipid profile and does not target various stages of plaque progression. Obviously, treating the disease at initial stages is better than beginning treatment at advanced stages and, in that regard, current atherosclerosis management can be improved. Cholesterol retention is an important component of atherogenesis that precedes plaque formation. Therapeutic targeting of cholesterol retention may be beneficial for preventing further atherogenic progression. For this purpose, we suggest using herbal preparations due to good tolerability and suitability for long-lasting treatment. We developed test systems based on cultured human intimal aortic cells for rapid screening of potential anti-atherogenic drugs. With the help of these test systems, we selected several natural substances with significant anti-atherogenic activity and further use these compounds to prepare herbal preparations for anti-atherosclerotic therapy. These preparations were clinically tested and showed good safety and a potent anti-atherogenic potential."
30621518,"The myoblast-mediated delivery of angiogenic genes represents a cell-based approach for targeted induction of therapeutic collateralization. Here, we tested the superiority of myoblast-mediated co-delivery of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF) together with platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) on transpial collateralization of an indirect encephalomyosynangiosis (EMS) in a model of chronic cerebral ischemia. Mouse myoblasts expressing a reporter gene alone (empty vector), VEGF, PDGF-BB or VEGF and PDGF-BB through a single bi-cistronic vector (VIP) were implanted into the temporalis muscle of an EMS following permanent ipsilateral internal carotid artery occlusion in adult, male C57BL/6N mice. Over 84 days, myoblast engraftment and gene product expression, hemodynamic impairment, transpial collateralization, angiogenesis, pericyte recruitment and post-ischemic neuroprotection were assessed. By day 42, animals that received PDGF-BB in combination with VEGF (VIP) showed superior hemodynamic recovery, EMS collateralization and ischemic protection with improved pericyte recruitment around the parenchymal vessels and EMS collaterals. Also, supplementation of PDGF-BB resulted in a striking astrocytic activation with intrinsic VEGF mobilization in the cortex below the EMS. Our findings suggest that EMS surgery together with myoblast-mediated co-delivery of VEGF/PDGF-BB may have the potential to serve as a novel treatment strategy for augmentation of collateral flow in the chronically hypoperfused brain."
30621487,"Light is a potent synchronizer of the central circadian clock; however, the effect of light exposure on peripheral gene expression is largely unknown. The objective of this study was to explore the effect of bright light exposure on genome-wide peripheral gene expression levels during a 4-day simulated night shift protocol in which the habitual sleep period is delayed by 10 h. Eleven healthy participants (mean age, 24 years; range, 18-30; 10 men/1 woman) were studied under controlled laboratory conditions. Three participants were exposed to bright light (~6,500 lux) for 8 h during the nightly waking period, while the other 8 were maintained in dim-light conditions (~10 lux). At baseline and on the fourth day after the shift in the sleep period, blood samples were collected during two 24-h measurement periods. RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and used to obtain transcriptomic data. Using 2 independent approaches to determine phase shifts among rhythmically expressed genes after the shifted sleep schedule compared with baseline, we found that the average phase delay in the bright light group was approximately 8 to 9 h, whereas the average phase delay in the control group was approximately 1 to 2 h, both at the group level and at the individual level. In line with these findings, further analysis using partial least squares regression indicated that the peripheral circadian transcriptome of PBMCs was predictive of the phase of the central circadian pacemaker after only 3 days of bright light exposure. These results indicate that bright light exposure exerts a phase-shifting effect on the circadian transcriptome in PBMCs with a magnitude similar to its effect on the central circadian clock."
30621472,"Chronic hepatitis B (CHB) infection causes considerable morbidity and mortality and hence should be a target for global elimination. In recent years, advances have been made in understanding the disease pathophysiology and the relationship to clinical outcome. Novel treatment targets are actively being sought in the hope of improving the treatment outlook. Areas covered: We discussed the cascade of cure of CHB with respect to the degree of persistence of viral genome and proteins. Several novel antiviral agents either targeting the virus or the host are in different clinical phases of development. Serum hepatitis B core-related antigen and HBV RNA are novel markers, which might have a role in the prediction of specific clinical outcomes such as development of hepatocellular carcinoma or virological relapse after cessation of antiviral therapy. These markers may also be used to monitor treatment response in the drug trials. Expert commentary: Global elimination of CHB is challenged by extremely low awareness of illness and poor access to care. CHB and its related complications can be reduced by birth dose vaccine, antiviral therapy, and alleviated by complication screening. Treatment options for CHB will expand in the next decade and early functional cure is not an impractical goal."
30621310,"Sustained pacemaker function is a challenge in biological pacemaker engineering. Human cardiomyocyte progenitor cells (CMPCs) have exhibited extended survival in the heart after transplantation. We studied whether lentivirally transduced CMPCs that express the pacemaker current <i>I<sub>f</sub></i> (encoded by <i>HCN4</i>) can be used as functional gene delivery vehicle in biological pacing. Human CMPCs were isolated from fetal hearts using magnetic beads coated with Sca-1 antibody, cultured in nondifferentiating conditions, and transduced with a green fluorescent protein (<i>GFP</i>)- or HCN4-GFP-expressing lentivirus. A patch-clamp analysis showed a large hyperpolarization-activated, time-dependent inward current (-20 pA/pF at -140 mV, n = 14) with properties typical of <i>I<sub>f</sub></i> in HCN4-GFP-expressing CMPCs. Gap-junctional coupling between CMPCs and neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) was demonstrated by efficient dye transfer and changes in spontaneous beating activity. In organ explant cultures, the number of preparations showing spontaneous beating activity increased from 6.3% in CMPC/GFP-injected preparations to 68.2% in CMPC/HCN4-GFP-injected preparations (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, in CMPC/HCN4-GFP-injected preparations, isoproterenol induced a significant reduction in cycle lengths from 648 ± 169 to 392 ± 71 ms (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In sum, CMPCs expressing HCN4-GFP functionally couple to NRVMs and induce physiologically controlled pacemaker activity and may therefore provide an attractive delivery platform for sustained pacemaker function."
30621308,"Optic neuropathy is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness caused by retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration. The development of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-based therapy opens a therapeutic window for RGC degeneration, and tissue engineering may further promote the efficiency of differentiation process of iPSCs. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of a novel biomimetic polybenzyl glutamate (PBG) scaffold on culturing iPSC-derived RGC progenitors. The iPSC-derived neural spheres cultured on PBG scaffold increased the differentiated retinal neurons and promoted the neurite outgrowth in the RGC progenitor layer. Additionally, iPSCs cultured on PBG scaffold formed the organoid-like structures compared to that of iPSCs cultured on cover glass within the same culture period. With RNA-seq, we found that cells of the PBG group were differentiated toward retinal lineage and may be related to the glutamate signaling pathway. Further ontological analysis and the gene network analysis showed that the differentially expressed genes between cells of the PBG group and the control group were mainly associated with neuronal differentiation, neuronal maturation, and more specifically, retinal differentiation and maturation. The novel electrospinning PBG scaffold is beneficial for culturing iPSC-derived RGC progenitors as well as retinal organoids. Cells cultured on PBG scaffold differentiate effectively and shorten the process of RGC differentiation compared to that of cells cultured on coverslip. The new culture system may be helpful in future disease modeling, pharmacological screening, autologous transplantation, as well as narrowing the gap to clinical application."
30621179,"The frontiers of precision medicine have been revolutionized by the development of Clustered Regularly-Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 as an editing tool. CRISPR/Cas9 has been used to develop animal models, understand disease mechanisms, and validate treatment targets. In addition, it is regarded as an effective tool for genome surgery when combined with viral delivery vectors. In this article, we will explore the various viral mechanisms for delivering CRISPR/Cas9 into tissues and cells, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of each method. We will also review the history and recent development of CRISPR and viral vectors and discuss their applications as a powerful tool in furthering our exploration of disease mechanisms and therapies."
30621149,"Opioid peptides released during digestion of dietary proteins such as casein, were suggested to contribute to autism development, leading to the announcement of opioid excess hypothesis of autism. This paper examines role of enzyme proline dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPPIV; EC 3.4.14.5) and it is exogenous substrate, β-casomorphin-7 (BCM7) in autism etiology. Our study included measurements of DPPIV and BCM7 concentrations in serum and urine, which were analyzed with ELISA assays and activity of DPPIV was measured by colorimetric test. The effect of opioid peptides from hydrolysed bovine milk on DPPIV gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in autistic and healthy children was determined using the Real-Time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method. Our research included 51 healthy children and 86 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, ICDF84). We determined that the concentration of BCM7 in serum was significantly, 1.6-fold, higher in the ASD group than in controls (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Concentration of DPPIV was found to also be significantly higher in serum from ASD children compared to the control group (<i>p</i> < 0.01), while we did not notice significant difference in enzymatic activity of serum DPPIV between the two study groups. We confirmed correlation according to the gender between analyzed parameters. The inspiration for this study emanated from clinical experience of the daily diet role in relieving the symptoms of autism. Despite this, we have concluded that milk-derived opioid peptides and DPPIV are potentially factors in determining the pathogenesis of autism; conducted studies are still limited and require further research."
30621068,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, is caused by the absence or a decreased amount of the muscle cytoskeletal protein dystrophin. Currently, several therapeutic approaches to cure DMD are being investigated, which can be categorized into two groups: therapies that aim to restore dystrophin expression, and those that aim to compensate for the lack of dystrophin. Therapies that restore dystrophin expression include read-through therapy, exon skipping, vector-mediated gene therapy, and cell therapy. Of these approaches, the most advanced are the read-through and exon skipping therapies. In 2014, ataluren, a drug that can promote ribosomal read-through of mRNA containing a premature stop codon, was conditionally approved in Europe. In 2016, eteplirsen, a morpholino-based chemical capable of skipping exon 51 in premature mRNA, received conditional approval in the USA. Clinical trials on vector-mediated gene therapy carrying micro- and mini- dystrophin are underway. More innovative therapeutic approaches include CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing and stem cell-based cell therapies. Here we review the current status of therapeutic approaches for DMD, focusing on therapeutic approaches that can restore dystrophin."
30621042,"Parkinson's Disease (PD) is an intractable disease resulting in localized neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta. Many current therapies of PD can only address the symptoms and not the underlying neurodegeneration of PD. To better understand the pathophysiological condition, researchers continue to seek models that mirror PD's phenotypic manifestations as closely as possible. Recent advances in the field of cellular reprogramming and personalized medicine now allow for previously unattainable cell therapies and patient-specific modeling of PD using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs can be selectively differentiated into a dopaminergic neuron fate naturally susceptible to neurodegeneration. In iPSC models, unlike other artificially-induced models, endogenous cellular machinery and transcriptional feedback are preserved, a fundamental step in accurately modeling this genetically complex disease. In addition to accurately modeling PD, iPSC lines can also be established with specific genetic risk factors to assess genetic sub-populations' differing response to treatment. iPS cell lines can then be genetically corrected and subsequently transplanted back into the patient in hopes of re-establishing function. Current techniques focus on iPSCs because they are patient-specific, thereby reducing the risk of immune rejection. The year 2018 marked history as the year that the first human trial for PD iPSC transplantation began in Japan. This form of cell therapy has shown promising results in other model organisms and is currently one of our best options in slowing or even halting the progression of PD. Here, we examine the genetic contributions that have reshaped our understanding of PD, as well as the advantages and applications of iPSCs for modeling disease and personalized therapies."
30621022,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) leading to demyelination and axonal damage. It often affects young adults and can lead to neurological disability. Interferon β (IFNβ) preparations represent widely used treatment regimens for patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) with therapeutic efficacy in reducing disease progression and frequency of acute exacerbations. In mice, IFNβ therapy has been shown to ameliorate experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS while genetic deletion of IFNβ or its receptor augments clinical severity of disease. However, the complex mechanism of action of IFNβ in CNS autoimmunity has not been fully elucidated. Here, we review our current understanding of the origin, phenotype, and function of microglia and CNS immigrating macrophages in the pathogenesis of MS and EAE. In addition, we highlight the emerging roles of microglia as IFNβ-producing cells and vice versa the impact of IFNβ on microglia in CNS autoimmunity. We finally discuss recent progress in unraveling the underlying molecular mechanisms of IFNβ-mediated effects in EAE."
30620975,"Lipoedema is a painful, chronic progressive disorder of adipose tissue, characterised by symmetrical swelling of the lower and/or upper limbs. Due to a lack of awareness, lipoedema is frequently misdiagnosed. However, accurate diagnosis and treatment are essential since they determine the patient's prognosis. There is no known causal therapy because the exact aetiology of the disease is not fully understood at this time. Familial aggregation is common, which suggests a genetic disorder. Since lipoedema is almost exclusively found in women and manifests around hormonal changes (puberty, pregnancy, menopause), oestrogen is believed to play a decisive role in its pathogenesis. This review aims to summarise the symptoms and clinical features of lipoedema, its differential diagnosis, treatment options, and current theories on the pathogenesis of lipoedema."
30620760,"This study aimed to evaluate neuropeptide expression after bleaching treatment using histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses and the effects of hydrocortisone and acetaminophen on pulp inflammation, sine dental bleaching and inflammation first occur, and only then, the treatmentt. Sixty-three rats were divided into three groups (n = 21) according to the pain-relieving therapy used: I-control; II-topical application of Otosporin for 10 min after the bleaching treatment; III-oral administration of paracetamol 30 min before whitening and then every 12h. In all the study groups, placebo gel was applied to the left upper jaw (control) and a 35% H2O2-based whitening gel was applied to the right upper jaw for 45 min. Seven animals from each group were euthanized at different time points: 0h after treatment, 24h, and 48h. After euthanasia, the first molar on each side was analyzed by histology and immunohistochemistry to assess the degree of inflammation and verify the presence of the neuropeptides, substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). The data were analyzed using the statistical nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Dunn's test for individual comparisons. Extensive areas of necrosis were observed in the groups that received bleaching treatment only, whereas reduced damage were obtained in the group treated with Otosporin. The immunohistochemical analysis showed positive immunolabeling in all groups, including the control, but this was stronger in the groups that received bleaching treatment. The best results were obtained in the group that received treatment with Otosporin. The use of Otosporin after dental bleaching minimized the side effects of this treatment."
30620734,"Streptococcus pneumoniae displays increased resistance to antibiotic therapy following biofilm formation. A genome-wide search revealed that SP 0320 and SP 0675 (respectively annotated as 5-keto-D-gluconate-5-reductase and glucose dehydrogenase) contain the highest degree of homology to CsgA of Myxococcus xanthus, a signaling factor that promotes cell aggregation and biofilm formation. Single and double SP 0320 and SP 0675 knockout mutants were created in strain BS72; however, no differences were observed in the biofilm-forming phenotypes of mutants compared to the wild type strain. Using the chinchilla model of otitis media and invasive disease, all three mutants exhibited greatly increased virulence compared to the wild type strain (increased pus formation, tympanic membrane rupture, mortality rates). The SP 0320 gene is located in an operon with SP 0317, SP 0318 and SP 0319, which we bioinformatically annotated as being part of the Entner-Doudoroff pathway. Deletion of SP 0317 also resulted in increased mortality in chinchillas; however, mutations in SP 0318 and SP 0319 did not alter the virulence of bacteria compared to the wild type strain. Complementing the SP 0317, SP 0320 and SP 0675 mutant strains reversed the virulence phenotype. We prepared recombinant SP 0317, SP 0318, SP 0320 and SP 0675 proteins and confirmed their functions. These data reveal that disruption of genes involved in the degradation of ketogluconate, the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, and glucose dehydrogenase significantly increase the virulence of bacteria in vivo; two hypothetical models involving virulence triggered by reduced in carbon-flux through the glycolytic pathways are presented."
30620563,"The B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) gene encodes for an antiapoptotic protein associated with the onset of many human tumors. Several oligonucleotides (ONs) and ON analogues are under study as potential tools to counteract the Bcl-2 expression. Among these are Peptide Nucleic Acids (PNAs). The absence of charges on PNA backbones allows the formation of PNA/DNA complexes provided with higher stability than the corresponding natural DNA/DNA counterparts. To date, the use of PNAs in antigene or antisense strategies is strongly limited by their inability to efficiently cross the cellular membranes. With the aim of downregulating the expression of Bcl-2, we propose here a novel antigene approach which uses oncolytic adenoviral vectors (OAds) as a new cancer cell-targeted PNA delivery system. The ability of oncolytic Ad5D24 vectors to selectively infect and kill cancer cells was exploited to transfect with high efficiency and selectivity a short cytosine-rich PNA complementary to the longest loop of the main G-quadruplex formed by the 23-base-long bcl2midG4 sequence located 52-30 bp upstream of the P1 promoter of Bcl-2 gene. Physico-chemical and biological investigations confirmed the ability of the PNA-conjugated Ad5D24 vectors to load and transfect their PNA cargo into human A549 and MDA-MB-436 cancer cell lines, as well as the synergistic (OAd+PNA) cytotoxic effect against the same cell lines. This approach holds promise for safer chemotherapy because of reduced toxicity to healthy tissues and organs."
30620386,Ampullary carcinoma (AC) is a rare gastrointestinal cancer. Pathogenic germline alterations (PGAs) in BRCA2 and potentially targetable somatic alterations (SAs) in ERBB2 and ELF3 have been previously described in AC. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center has implemented an opt-in strategy for germline testing (GT) and somatic testing (ST) for patients with AC to further evaluate the spectrum of PGAs and SAs.
30620381,"The vital need for Akt in maintaining basic cellular function has highlighted its importance in carcinogenesis. Unfortunately, Akt inhibitor development outcome has remained poor, as most of them have failed to show significant clinical benefit to cancer patients during the clinical trials. Recently, a new class of non-coding RNAs, known as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which show high tissue specificity, have demonstrated great influence in cancer progression and/or cancer inhibition. As both Akt signalling pathways and lncRNAs play such innate roles in carcinogenesis, identifying the specific roles that these lncRNAs play within this pathway may represent a novel research avenue for developing Akt inhibitors with better therapeutic properties. In addition, understanding the diverse mechanism by which lncRNAs regulate gene expression can assist in deciphering the fundamentals of carcinogenesis. The focus of interest should be on the lncRNAs, which affect Akt and finding the link between lncRNAs and Akt pathways associated with carcinogenesis. LncRNAs within the Akt pathways could affect multiple pathways in a particular cancer type, which ultimately creates an intricate web of connections between the pathways. In summary, lncRNAs have tremendous potential in cancer diagnosis, assessing cancer patient prognosis and in developing new therapeutic options for patients with resistance to current cancer therapies. Thus, understanding how lncRNAs influence the Akt pathway is essential for the development of novel and effective cancer therapies."
30620007,"Iodine is a crucial component of thyroid hormones; therefore, a key requirement for thyroid hormone biosynthesis is that iodide (I<sup>-</sup>) be actively accumulated in the thyroid follicular cell. The ability of the thyroid epithelia to concentrate I<sup>-</sup> is ultimately dependent on functional Na<sup>+</sup>/ I<sup>-</sup> symporter (NIS) expression at the plasma membrane. Underscoring the significance of NIS for thyroid physiology, loss-of-function mutations in the NIS-coding <i>SLC5A5</i> gene cause an I<sup>-</sup> transport defect, resulting in dyshormonogenic congenital hypothyroidism. Moreover, I<sup>-</sup> accumulation in the thyroid cell constitutes the cornerstone for radioiodide ablation therapy for differentiated thyroid carcinoma. However, differentiated thyroid tumors often exhibit reduced (or even undetectable) I<sup>-</sup> transport compared with normal thyroid tissue, and they are diagnosed as cold nodules on thyroid scintigraphy. Paradoxically, immunohistochemistry analysis revealed that cold thyroid nodules do not express NIS or express normal, or even higher NIS levels compared with adjacent normal tissue, but NIS is frequently intracellularly retained, suggesting the presence of posttranslational abnormalities in the transport of the protein to the plasma membrane. Ultimately, a thorough comprehension of the mechanisms that regulate NIS transport to the plasma membrane would have multiple implications for radioiodide therapy, opening the possibility to identify new molecular targets to treat radioiodide-refractory thyroid tumors. Therefore, in this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding posttranslational mechanisms that regulate NIS transport to the plasma membrane under physiological and pathological conditions affecting the thyroid follicular cell, a topic of great interest in the thyroid cancer field."
30620000,"Hepatocyte transplantation is an attractive alternative to liver transplantation. Thus far, however, extensive liver repopulation by adult hepatocytes has required ongoing genetic, physical, or chemical injury to host liver. We hypothesized that providing a regulated proliferative and/or survival advantage to transplanted hepatocytes should enable repopulation in a normal liver microenvironment. Here, we repopulated livers of DPPIV<sup>-</sup> (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) rats and <i>Ugt1a1</i> (uridinediphosphoglucuronate glucuronosyltransferase 1a1)-deficient Gunn rats (model of Crigler-Najjar syndrome type 1), both models without underlying liver injury, for up to 1 year by transplanting lenti-hYAP-ERT2 (mutated estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain 2)-transduced hepatocytes (YAP-Hc). Yap (yes-associated protein) nuclear translocation/function in YAP-Hc was regulated by tamoxifen. Repopulating YAP-Hc and host hepatocytes were fluorescence-activated cell sorting-purified and their transcriptomic profiles compared by RNAseq. After 1 year of liver repopulation, YAP-Hc clusters exhibited normal morphology, integration into hepatic plates and hepatocyte-specific gene expression, without dysplasia, dedifferentiation, or tumorigenesis. RNAseq analysis showed up-regulation of 145 genes promoting cell proliferation and 305 genes suppressing apoptosis, including hepatocyte growth factor and connective tissue growth factor among the top 30 in each category and provided insight into the mechanism of cell competition that enabled replacement of host hepatocytes by YAP-Hc. In Gunn rats transplanted with YAP-Hc+tamoxifen, there was a 65%-81% decline in serum bilirubin over 6 months versus 8%-20% with control-Hc, representing a 3-4-fold increase in therapeutic response. This correlated with liver repopulation as demonstrated by the presence of <i>Ugt1a1</i>-positive hepatocyte clusters in livers and western blot analysis of tissue homogenates. <i>Conclusion:</i> Tamoxifen-regulated nuclear translocation/function of hYAP-ERT2 enabled long-term repopulation of DPPIV<sup>-/-</sup> and Gunn rat livers by hYAP-ERT2-transduced hepatocytes without tumorigenesis. This cell transplantation strategy may offer a potential therapy for most of the inherited monogenic liver diseases that do not exhibit liver injury."

30619914,"Adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors packaging the CRISPR-Cas9 system (AAV-CRISPR) can efficiently modify disease-relevant genes in somatic tissues with high efficiency. AAV vectors are a preferred delivery vehicle for tissue-directed gene therapy because of their ability to achieve sustained expression from largely non-integrating episomal genomes. However, for genome editizng applications, permanent expression of non-human proteins such as the bacterially derived Cas9 nuclease is undesirable. Methods are needed to achieve efficient genome editing <i>in vivo</i>, with controlled transient expression of CRISPR-Cas9. Here, we report a self-deleting AAV-CRISPR system that introduces insertion and deletion mutations into AAV episomes. We demonstrate that this system dramatically reduces the level of <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> Cas9 protein, often greater than 79%, while achieving high rates of on-target editing in the liver. Off-target mutagenesis was not observed for the self-deleting Cas9 guide RNA at any of the predicted potential off-target sites examined. This system is efficient and versatile, as demonstrated by robust knockdown of liver-expressed proteins <i>in vivo</i>. This self-deleting AAV-CRISPR system is an important proof of concept that will help enable translation of liver-directed genome editing in humans."
30619856,"The efficacy of T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) for solid tumors has been limited by insufficient CAR T cell expansion and persistence. The use of virus-specific T cells (VSTs) as carriers for CARs may overcome this limitation since CAR-VSTs can be boosted by viral vaccines or oncolytic viruses. However, there is limited understanding of the optimal combination of endodomains and their influence on the native T cell receptor (TCR) in VSTs. We therefore compared the function of GD2.CARs expressing the TCR zeta chain (ζ) alone or combined with endodomains from CD28 and 4-1BB in varicella zoster virus-specific (VZV) T cells. VZVSTs expressing GD2-CARs recognized VZV-derived peptides and killed GD2-expressing tumor cells. However, after repeated stimulation through their native TCR, the expansion of GD2-CAR.CD28ζ-VZVSTs was 3.3-fold greater (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than non-transduced VZVSTs, whereas GD2-CARζ- and GD2-CAR.41BBζ inhibited VZVST expansion (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Compared to control VZVSTs, GD2-CAR.ζ VZVSTs showed a greater frequency of apoptotic (<i>p</i> < 0.01) T cells, whereas prolonged downregulation of the native αβ TCR was observed in GD2-CAR.41BBζ VZVSTs (<i>p</i> < 0.001). We confirmed that CD28ζ can best maintain TCR function by expressing GD2.CARs in Epstein-Barr virus-specific T cells and CD19-CARs in VZVSTs. In response to CAR stimulation VSTs with CD28ζ endodomains also showed the greatest expansion (6 fold > GD2-CAR.41BBζ VZVSTs (<i>p</i> < 0.001), however anti-tumor efficacy was superior in GD2-CAR.41BBζ-VZVSTs. These findings demonstrate that CAR signaling domains can enhance or diminish the function of the native TCR and indicate that only CD28ζ may preserve the function of the native TCR in tonically signaling CAR-VSTs."
30619769,"Mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) signaling which is closely associated with hypertension plays important roles in resistance to antiandrogen therapy in prostate cancer. However, its impact on the prognosis in androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) has not been elucidated. Then, we investigated the impact of genetic variation in MR and comorbidity with hypertension on the prognosis in ADT. This study included 182 Japanese patients with prostate cancer treated with ADT, whose comorbidity status with hypertension were available. The associations of MR polymorphism (rs5522) and comorbidity with hypertension with clinicopathological parameters as well as progression-free survival and overall survival were examined. Clinicopathological characteristics were comparable between genetic variation in MR. However, homozygous variant in MR was associated with shorter time to castration resistance (<i>P</i> = 0.014) and any-cause death (<i>P</i> = 0.024). In patients' background, presence of comorbidity with hypertension showed the trend with lower PSA level at diagnosis and lower biopsy Gleason score, as well as significant association with less incidence of N1. Comorbidity with hypertension was associated with longer time to castration resistance (<i>P</i> = 0.043) and any-cause death (<i>P</i> = 0.046), which was diminished on multivariate analysis including age, PSA level at diagnosis, biopsy Gleason score, clinical stage, and the modality of hormonal therapy. Genetic variation in <i>MR</i> (rs5522) and comorbidity with hypertension were significantly and potentially associated with prognosis when treated with ADT, respectively. This suggests that the individual intensity of MR signaling may be associated with resistance to ADT and a promising biomarker in ADT."
30619765,"Oxymatrine (OMT) has shown broad antitumor activities for the treatment of several types of cancers. However, little is known about its effect on anti-tumor immunity. Combination therapy is a potentially promising strategy of cancer to enhance anticancer activity, overcome drug resistance, and lower treatment failure rate. In the present study, we demonstrated that the combination of OMT with cisplatin (DDP) synergistically inhibited non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells growth when co-cultured with peripheral blood mononuclear cells <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, the combination of OMT with DDP significantly inhibited the growth of Lewis lung cancer (LLC) mouse xenograft tumors. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that OMT and DDP synergistically increase the CD8<sup>+</sup>/ regulatory T cells ratio and enhanced more CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells secreted cytokines of IFN-γ, TNF-α, and IL-2 <i>in vivo</i>. Mechanistically, upregulation of <i>miR-155</i> and downregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling-1 (<i>SOCS1</i>) were confirmed as a target signaling pathway to positively regulate the anti-tumor response of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Overall, OMT in combination with DDP showed outstanding synergistic anti-tumor immunity, suggesting that this beneficial combination may offer a potential immunotherapy for NSCLC patients."
30619763,"<b>Background:</b> There is increasing evidence that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are involved in the process of carcinogenesis and treatment using chemotherapy. Pterostilbene, a phytochemical agent with natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, has been shown to modulate oncogenic processes in many cancers. However, there has been limited research on the association between pterostilbene and the expression of lncRNAs. <b>Methods:</b> MCF7 breast cancer cells were treated with various concentrations of pterostilbene and their gene expression profile was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. <b>Results:</b> Treatment with pterostilbene inhibited cell proliferation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and increased cell apoptosis, autophagy and ER stress. The Akt/mTOR pathway was downregulated, but p38 MAPK/Erk signaling was activated in cells following treatment with pterostilbene. Pterostilbene increased the expression of the lncRNAs MEG3, TUG1, H19, and DICER1-AS1 whereas the expression of LINC01121, PTTG3P, and HOTAIR declined. Knockdown of lncRNA H19 resulted in a reduction of the cell invasion, with the cells becoming more sensitive to pterostilbene therapy. <b>Conclusions:</b> These results suggest that efficient optimum disruption of lncRNA expression might possibly improve the anti-tumor effects of phytochemical agents, thus serving as a potential therapy for breast cancer."
30619750,"Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) is a lethal cancer requiring improved screening strategies and treatment options due to poor detection methods, aggressive progression, and therapeutic resistance. Emerging circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) technologies may offer a unique non-invasive strategy to better characterize the highly heterogeneous cancer and more clearly establish the genetic modulations leading to disease progression. The presented review describes the potential advantages of ctDNA methodologies as compared to current clinical strategies to improve clinical detection, enhance disease surveillance, evaluate prognosis, and personalize treatment. Specifically, we describe the ctDNA-targetable genetic markers of prognostic significance to stratify patients into risk of progression from benign to malignant disease and potentially offer cost-effective screening of established cancer. We also describe the application of ctDNA to more effectively characterize the heterogeneity and particular mutagenic resistance mechanisms in real-time to improve prognosis and therapeutic monitoring strategies. Lastly, we discuss the inconsistent clinical responses to currently approved therapies for EAC and the role of ctDNA to explore the dynamic regulation of novel targeted and immunotherapies to personalize therapy and improve patient outcomes. Although there are clear limitations of ctDNA technologies for immediate clinical deployment, this review presents the prospective role of such applications to potentially overcome many of the notable hurdles to treating EAC patients. A deeper understanding of complex EAC tumor biology may result in the progress toward improved clinical outcomes."

Because of its poor prognosis, there is a demand for novel treatments for GDLD. Here, we establish a new in vitro disease model of GDLD based on immortalized human corneal epithelial (HCE-T) cells."
30619452,"The initiate site of DNA replication is called origins of replication (ORI) which is regulated by a set of regulatory proteins and plays important roles in the basic biochemical process during cell growth and division in all living organisms. Therefore, the study of ORIs is essential for understanding the cell-division cycle and gene expression regulation so that scholars can develop a new strategy against genetic diseases by using the knowledge of DNA replication. Thus, the accurate identification of ORIs will provide key clues for DNA replication research and clinical medicine. Although, the conventional experiments could provide accurate results, they are time-consuming and cost ineffective. On the contrary, bioinformatics-based methods can overcome these shortcomings. Especially, with the emergence of DNA sequences in the post-genomic era, it is highly expected to develop high throughput tools to identify ORIs based on sequence information. In this review, we will summarize the current progress in computational prediction of eukaryotic ORIs including the collection of benchmark dataset, the application of machine learning-based techniques, the results obtained by these methods, and the construction of web servers. Finally, we gave the future perspectives on ORIs prediction. The review provided readers with a whole background of ORIs prediction based on machine learning methods, which will be helpful for researchers to study DNA replication in-depth and drug therapy of genetic defect."
30619446,"Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD) is a rare neurodegenerative disease that often cuts short the life span of a child to 10 years. With a typical onset at 6 months of age, INAD is characterized by regression of acquired motor skills, delayed motor coordination and eventual loss of voluntary muscle control. Biallelic mutations in the PLA2G6 gene have been identified as the most frequent cause of INAD. We highlight the salient features of INAD molecular pathology and the progress made in molecular diagnostics. We reiterate that enhanced molecular diagnostic methodologies such as targeted gene panel testing, exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing can help ascertain a molecular diagnosis. We describe how the defective catalytic activity of the PLA2G6 gene could be potentially overcome by enzyme replacement or gene correction, giving examples and challenges specific to INAD. This is expected to encourage steps toward developing and testing emerging therapies that might alleviate INAD progression and help realize objectives of patient formed organizations such as the INADcure Foundation."
30619401,"Herbal medicines are used globally for their health benefits as an alternative therapy method to modern medicines. The market for herbal products has increased rapidly over the last few decades, but this has in turn increased the opportunities for malpractices such as contamination or substitution of products with alternative plant species. In the 1990s, a series of severe renal disease cases were reported in Belgium associated with weight loss treatment, in which the active species <i>Stephania tetrandra</i> was found to be substituted with <i>Aristolochia fangchi</i>. <i>A. fangchi</i> contains toxic aristolochic acids, which have been linked to kidney failure, as well as cancers of the urinary tract. Because of these known toxicities, herbal medicines containing these compounds, or potentially contaminated by these plants, have been restricted or banned in some countries, but they are still available via the internet and in alternate formulations. In this study, a DNA based method based on quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was tested to detect and distinguish <i>Aristolochia</i> subg. <i>Siphisia</i> (Duch.) O.C.Schmidt species from a range of medicinal plants that could potentially be contaminated with <i>Aristolochia</i> material. Specific primers were designed to confirm that <i>Aristolochia</i> subg. <i>Siphisia</i> can be detected, even in small amounts, if it is present in the products, fulfilling the aim of offering a simple, cheaper and faster solution than the chemical methods. A synthetic gBlock template containing the primer sequences was used as a reference standard to calibrate the qPCR assay and to estimate the copy number of a target gene per sample. Generic primers covering the conserved 5.8S rRNA coding region were used as internal control to verify DNA quality and also as a reference gene for relative quantitation. To cope with potentially degraded DNA, all qPCR primer sets were designed to generate PCR products of under 100 bp allowing detection and quantification of <i>A. fangchi</i> gBlock even when mixed with <i>S. tetrandra</i> gBlock in different ratios. All proportions of <i>Aristolochia</i>, from 100 to 2%, were detected. Using standards, associating the copy number to each start quantity, the detection limit was calculated and set to about 50 copies."
30619377,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune-mediated disease that is associated with significant cartilage damage and immunosenescence. Despite decades of research, the major signal pathways that initiate RA are still unclear. The DNA damage response (DDR) is a specific and hierarchical network that includes cell cycle checkpoints, DNA repair, and DNA-damage tolerance pathways. Recent studies suggest that this condition is associated with deficits in telomere maintenance and overall genomic instability in the T cells of RA patients. Analysis of the underlying mechanisms has revealed defects in DDR pathways. Particularly, the DNA repair enzyme, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), is downregulated, which leaves the damaged DNA breaks in RA-associated T cells unrepaired and pushes them to apoptosis, exhausts the T cell pool, and promotes the arthritogenesis effector function of T cells. This review discusses recent advancements and illustrates that risk factors for RA, such as viral infections, environmental events, and genetic risk loci are combat with DDR signals, and the impaired DDR response of RA-associated T cells, in turn, triggers disease-related phenotypes. Therefore, DDR is the dominant signal that converts genetic and environmental stress to RA-related immune dysfunction. Understanding the orchestration of RA pathogenesis by DDR signals would further our current knowledge of RA and provide novel avenues in RA therapy."
30619339,"<b>Background:</b> Mucosal IL-13 Receptor alpha 2 (<i>IL13RA2</i>) mRNA expression is one of the best predictive markers for primary non-responsiveness to infliximab therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The objective of this study was to understand how IL-13Rα2, a negative regulator of IL-13 signaling, can contribute to IBD pathology. <b>Methods:</b><i>IL13RA2</i> knockout (KO) and wild type (WT) mice were exposed to dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water to induce colitis. Furthermore, mucosal biopsies and resection specimen of healthy individuals and IBD patients before the start of anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy were obtained for immunohistochemistry and gene expression analysis. <b>Results:</b> After induction of DSS colitis, <i>IL13RA2</i> KO mice had similar disease severity, but recovered more rapidly than WT animals. Goblet cell numbers and mucosal architecture were also more rapidly restored in <i>IL13RA2</i> KO mice. In mucosal biopsies of active IBD patients, immunohistochemistry revealed that IL-13Rα2 protein was highly expressed in epithelial cells, while expression was restricted to goblet cells in healthy controls. Mucosal <i>IL13RA2</i> mRNA negatively correlated with mRNA of several goblet cell-specific and barrier genes, and with goblet cell numbers. <b>Conclusions:</b> The data suggest that IL-13Rα2 on epithelial cells contributes to IBD pathology by negatively influencing goblet cell recovery, goblet cell function and epithelial restoration after injury. Therefore, blocking IL-13Rα2 could be a promising target for restoration of the epithelial barrier in IBD."
30619261,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease that induces pain, cartilage deformation, and joint inflammation. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are potential therapeutic agents for treatment of OA. However, MSC therapy can cause excessive inflammation. Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) modulates secretion of many proinflammatory cytokines. Experimental OA was induced by intra-articular (IA) injection of monosodium iodoacetate (MIA) to the right knee of rats. MSCs from OA patients (OA-MSCs) were treated with STA21, a small molecule that blocks STAT3 signaling, by IA or intravenous (IV) injection after MIA injection. Pain severity was quantified by assessment of secondary tactile allodynia using the von Frey assessment test. Cartilage degradation was measured by microcomputed tomography image analysis, histological analysis, and the Mankin score. Protein and gene expression was evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. MSCs increased production of proinflammatory cytokines under inflammatory conditions. STA21 significantly decreased expression of these proinflammatory molecules via inhibition of STAT3 activity but increased gene expression of molecules related to migration potential and immunomodulation in OA-MSCs. STAT3-inhibited OA-MSCs administrated by IV or IA injection decreased pain severity and cartilage damage in rats with MIA-induced OA rats by decreasing proinflammatory cytokines in the joints. Combined IA and IV-injected STAT3-inhibited OA-MSCs had an additive effect of pain relief in MIA-induced OA rats. STAT3 inhibition may optimize the therapeutic activities of MSCs for treating OA by attenuating pain and progression of MIA by inhibiting inflammation and cartilage damage."
30619218,"Treatment failure of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection is caused mainly by progressive antibiotic resistance among <i>H. pylori</i> strains. In Poland, the prevalence of <i>H. pylori</i> strains resistant to metronidazole is higher than in other developed countries, reaching almost 50%, and resistance to clarithromycin is as high as 30% and is still increasing, contributing to the failure of first-line therapy in approximately 70% of patients. Moreover, the introduction of levofloxacin to eradication therapy of <i>H. pylori</i> infection quickly led to the emergence of resistant strains. Therefore, a necessary approach in microbiological diagnostics of <i>H. pylori</i> infection should be determination of susceptibility of <i>H. pylori</i> strains before the eradication treatment. <b>Aim:</b> In this study was to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of resistance among 170 <i>H. pylori</i> strains to clarithromycin, involving mutations in the 23S rRNA gene (A2143G, A2142G, A2143G) and to levofloxacin, involving mutations of <i>gyrA</i> and <i>gyrB</i>. Analysis was performed by using polymerase chain reaction and classical sequencing of DNA fragments. <b>Results:</b> Among examined strains, 26% were fully sensitive and 74% were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics. The overall resistance rate to metronidazole was as high as 56%, whereas to clarithromycin 46%, respectively. Resistance to LEV occurred among 6% of strains. All tested strains were susceptible to AMC and TET. The A2143G point mutation was found in 72% of clarithromycin-resistant strains. The most common mutation, present in 40% of <i>H. pylori</i> strains resistant to levofloxacin, was a change at position 91 of <i>gyrA</i>. <b>Conclusion:</b> The increasing number of point mutations in the 23S rRNA gene leads to an increase in the rates of antimicrobial resistance. Presence of the GCG allele at position 122 of the <i>gyrA</i> gene may cause an eightfold increase in risk of development of resistance to levofloxacin."
30619107,"Antiretroviral therapy has prolonged the lives of people living with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), transforming the disease into one that can be controlled with lifelong therapy. The search for an HIV-1 vaccine has plagued researchers for more than three decades with little to no success from clinical trials. Due to these failures, scientists have turned to alternative methods to develop next generation therapeutics that could allow patients to live with HIV-1 without the need for daily medication. One method that has been proposed has involved the use of a number of powerful gene editing tools; Zinc Finger Nucleases (ZFN), Transcription Activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)/Cas9 to edit the co-receptors (CCR5 or CXCR4) required for HIV-1 to infect susceptible target cells efficiently. Initial safety studies in patients have shown that editing the CCR5 locus is safe. More in depth <i>in vitro</i> studies have shown that editing the CCR5 locus was able to inhibit infection from CCR5-utilizing virus, but CXCR4-utilizing virus was still able to infect cells. Additional research efforts were then aimed at editing the CXCR4 locus, but this came with other safety concerns. However, <i>in vitro</i> studies have since confirmed that CXCR4 can be edited without killing cells and can confer resistance to CXCR4-utilizing HIV-1. Utilizing these powerful new gene editing technologies in concert could confer cellular resistance to HIV-1. While the CD4, CCR5, CXCR4 axis for cell-free infection has been the most studied, there are a plethora of reports suggesting that the cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 is significantly more efficient. These reports also indicated that while broadly neutralizing antibodies are well suited with respect to blocking cell-free infection, cell-to-cell transmission remains refractile to this approach. In addition to stopping cell-free infection, gene editing of the HIV-1 co-receptors could block cell-to-cell transmission. This review aims to summarize what has been shown with regard to editing the co-receptors needed for HIV-1 entry and how they could impact the future of HIV-1 therapeutic and prevention strategies."
30618851,"Bacterial prostatitis is believed to be the leading cause of recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs) in men under 50 years of age and occurs both as an acute febrile disease responsive to antibiotics and as a chronic infection that is often unresponsive to antibiotic treatment. <i>Proteus</i><i>mirabilis</i> is more commonly associated with UTIs in these abnormalities, especially in patients undergoing catheterisation. This pathogen is able to colonise the host's tissues and to cause disease thanks to the production of many virulence factors such as fimbriae, flagella, immune avoidance, host-damaging factors, and the ability to form crystalline biofilms. In addition, <i>Proteus</i> lipid A may exhibit apoptotic activity and induce desquamation of epithelial cells. The aim of this work was to evaluate the ability of two clinically isolated strains of <i>P. mirabilis</i> that are phenotypically different, named PM1 of PM2, respectively, to induce apoptosis in human prostatic adenocarcinoma PC-3. Our results demonstrate that PM1 and PM2 are able to activate two different apoptotic pathways, and this different behaviour is confirmed by the expression level of the <i>ZapA</i> gene, molecular fingerprinting and different spectrum of antibiotic resistance. The identification and knowledge of relations between the microorganism and host may provide the basis for new solutions to clinical problems with regard to diagnosis and therapy."
30618806,"Although cell survival post-transplantation is very low, emerging evidence using stem cell therapy for myocardial repair points toward a primary role of paracrine signaling mechanisms as the basis for improved cardiac function, decreased fibrosis, and increased angiogenesis. Recent studies have demonstrated that extracellular vesicles (EVs) such as exosomes secreted by stem cells stimulate angiogenesis, provide cytoprotection, and modulate apoptosis. However, the angiogenic potential of EVs secreted from human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CM), a terminally differentiated cell type, has not been elucidated yet. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to isolate, characterize, and evaluate the <i>in vitro</i> angiogenic potential of EVs collected from hiPSC-CM conditioned media. The hiPSC-CM were cultured for 2 weeks and EVs were isolated from cell culture medium. Isolated EVs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), nanoparticle tracking analysis, and immunoblotting. Furthermore, the angiogenic potential of these EVs was evaluated by tube formation, wound-healing, and cell-proliferation assays in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC). In addition, gene expression levels of growth factors was evaluated in hiPSC-derived endothelial cells (hiPSC-EC) treated with hiPSC-CM-derived EV (CM-EVs) to assess their role in promoting angiogenesis. TEM imaging of CM-EVs showed a presence of a double-membrane bound structure, which is a characteristic of EV. Nanoparticle tracking analysis further confirmed the size and shape of the secreted particles to be consistent with EVs. Furthermore, EV-specific markers (CD63 and HSP70) were enriched in these particles as illustrated by immunoblotting. Most importantly, BAEC treated with 100 μg/ml of CM-EVs showed significant increases in tube formation, wound closure, and cell proliferation as compared to control (no-EVs). Finally, treatment of hiPSC-EC with CM-EVs induced increased expression of pro-angiogenic growth factors by the endothelial cells. Overall, our results demonstrated that EVs isolated from hiPSC-CM enhance angiogenesis in endothelial cells. This acellular/cell-free approach constitutes a potential translational therapeutic to induce angiogenesis in patients with myocardial infarction."
30618788,"Chronic lithium administration for the treatment of bipolar disorder leads to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), characterized by polyuria, natriuresis, kaliuresis, and collecting duct remodeling and cell proliferation among other features. Previously, using a 2-week lithium-induced NDI model, we reported that P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor (R) knockout mice are significantly resistant to polyuria, natriuresis, kaliuresis, and decrease in AQP2 protein abundance in the kidney relative to wild type mice. Here we show this protection is long-lasting, and is also associated with significant amelioration of lithium-induced collecting duct remodeling and cell proliferation. Age-matched wild type and knockout mice were fed regular (<i>n</i> = 5/genotype) or lithium-added (40 mmol/kg chow; <i>n</i> = 10/genotype) diet for 5 months and euthanized. Water intake, urine output and osmolality were monitored once in every month. Salt blocks were provided to mice on lithium-diet to prevent sodium loss. At the end of 5 months mice were euthanized and serum and kidney samples were analyzed. There was a steady increase in lithium-induced polyuria, natriuresis and kaliuresis in wild type mice over the 5-month period. Increases in these urinary parameters were very low in lithium-fed knockout mice, resulting in significantly widening differences between the wild type and knockout mice. Terminal AQP2 and NKCC2 protein abundances in the kidney were significantly higher in lithium-fed knockout vs. wild type mice. There were no significant differences in terminal serum lithium or sodium levels between the wild type and knockout mice. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that lithium-induced marked remodeling of collecting duct with significantly increased proportion of [H<sup>+</sup>]-ATPase-positive intercalated cells and decreased proportion of AQP2-positive principal cells in the wild type, but not in knockout mice. Lithium-induced collecting duct cell proliferation (indicated by Ki67 labeling), was significantly lower in knockout vs. wild type mice. This is the first piece of evidence that purinergic signaling is potentially involved in lithium-induced collecting duct remodeling and cell proliferation. Our results demonstrate that genetic deletion of P2Y<sub>2</sub>-R protects against the key structural and functional alterations in Li-induced NDI, and underscore the potential utility of targeting this receptor for the treatment of NDI in bipolar patients on chronic lithium therapy."
30618757,"Macrophages are one of the most abundant immune cells in the solid tumor and their increased density is associated with the specific pathological features of cancers, including invasiveness, metastasis, immunosuppression, neovascularization, and poor response to therapy. Therefore, reprogramming macrophage behavior is emerging as a promising therapeutic modality for cancer treatment. RNA interference (RNAi) technology is one of the powerful strategies for the regulation of macrophage activities by silencing specific genes. However, as polyanionic biomacromolecules, RNAi therapeutics such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) cannot readily cross cell membrane and thus specific delivery vehicles are required to facilitate the cytosolic siRNA delivery. Herein, we developed a robust nanoparticle (NP) platform for efficient siRNA delivery and gene silencing in macrophages. This NP platform is composed of biodegradable poly (ethylene glycol)-<i>b</i>-poly (<i>𝜀</i>-caprolactone) (PEG-<i>b</i>-PCL), poly (<i>𝜀</i>-caprolactone)-<i>b</i>-poly (2-aminoethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCL-<i>b</i>-PPEEA), and PCL homopolymer. We chose CC-chemokine ligand 18 (CCL-18) as a proof of concept therapeutic target and our results demonstrate that the CCL-18 silencing in macrophages can significantly inhibit the migration of breast cancer cells. The successful regulation of the macrophage behavior demonstrated herein shows great potential as an effective strategy for cancer therapy."
30618737,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a complex disease. Our previous study revealed that <i>TRIB3</i> genetic variations were strongly associated with diabetic vascular complications, although <i>TRIB3</i> regulation pathways remain poorly understood. We used two extreme treatment groups from a 2 × 2 factorial randomized controlled trial to identify a positive association, which was further validated in patients receiving cross treatment to test the effect of genetic polymorphisms among the different treatment groups. A gene-centric score (GS)-weighted model including the three associated genetic variations <i>TRIB3</i> rs2295490, <i>ATF6</i> rs12086247, and <i>SMARCD3</i> rs58125572 was used. The results of the GS model indicated a 46% reduction in the risk of primary vascular complications in patients bearing more than two risk alleles [hazard ratio (HR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.38-0.76, <i>p</i> < 0.001], following intensive glucose control treatment when compared with patients who received standard glucose control treatment. Furthermore, these patients benefited from active blood pressure-lowering treatment (HR 0.39, 95% CI 0.24-0.64, <i>p</i> < 0.001). However, no significant difference was observed between the two interventions in patients with fewer than two risk alleles (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86-1.39, <i>p</i> = 0.47). These results indicate that genetic variants in these three genes may be useful biomarkers for individualized drug therapy in diabetic patients."
30618604,"Age-related neurosensory deficit of the inner ear is mostly due to a loss of hair cells (HCs). Development of stem cell-based therapy requires a better understanding of factors and signals that drive stem cells into otic sensory progenitor cells (OSPCs) to replace lost HCs. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) theoretically represent an unlimited supply for the generation of human OSPCs <i>in vitro</i>. In this study, we developed a monolayer-based differentiation system to generate an enriched population of OSPCs via a stepwise differentiation of hiPSCs. Gene and protein expression analyses revealed the efficient induction of a comprehensive panel of otic/placodal and late otic markers over the course of the differentiation. Furthermore, whole transcriptome analysis confirmed a developmental path of OSPC differentiation from hiPSCs. We found that modulation of WNT and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling combined with fibroblast growth factor 3 (FGF3) and FGF10 treatment over a 6-day period drives the expression of early otic/placodal markers followed by late otic sensory markers within 13 days, indicative of a differentiation into embryonic-like HCs. In summary, we report a rapid and efficient strategy to generate an enriched population of OSPCs from hiPSCs, thereby establishing the value of this approach for disease modeling and cell-based therapies of the inner ear."
30618300,"Malignant melanoma is an aggressive tumor with high fatality rates and poor prognosis, mainly due to the lack of efficient treatment methods. The present study investigated the potential antitumor effects of recombinant adenovirus p53 (rAd-p53) on human malignant melanoma. The optimal viral titer on a human malignant melanoma (A-375) cell line was determined for the rAd-p53 treatment. The invasive abilities, apoptosis, variations in the cell cycle, and molecular expression levels of A-375 cells were detected after infection by rAd-p53. A tumor growth curve and hematoxylin and eosin staining were carried out for experiments in nude mice. Twenty-one patients with malignant melanoma were evaluated, including 12 cases without gene therapy and nine cases with rAd-p53 gene therapy. The overall survival rate and the median survival time were analyzed between the two groups of patients. When the multiplicity of infection was 100, the cells showed the best transfection efficiency. The invasive ability, apoptosis, cycle changes of the cells, and the expression of the p53, p21, and Bax genes and proteins were significantly changed in the experimental group. In nude mice, the tumor growth curve and the tumor size in the experimental group were significantly smaller than those of the control group. Hematoxylin and eosin staining revealed tumor metastasis in the blank group and the control group but not in the experimental group. Between the two groups of patients, the median survival of the gene therapy group (38 months) was greater than that of the group without gene therapy (27 months). In this study, high expression of the p53 gene could regulate the gene expression and reduce the invasive and metastatic abilities of the tumor cells. Furthermore, rAd-p53 effectively improved the survival of patients with malignant melanoma. Therefore, rAd-p53 may be a potential treatment method for human malignant melanoma."
30618154,"Statins, with their lipid-lowering properties, are a first-line therapy for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recent evidence, however, suggests that statins can increase the risk of new-onset diabetes (NOD). The molecular mechanisms of statin-induced NOD are not precisely known, although some pathophysiologic mechanisms have been suggested. Specific to the beta cell, these mechanisms include alterations in insulin secretion, changes in ion channels, modulation of signaling pathways, and inflammation/oxidative stress. Outwith the beta cell, other suggested mechanisms involve adipocytes, including alterations in adipocyte differentiation and modulation of leptin and adiponectin, and genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, including alterations in microRNA. The evidence supporting these and other mechanisms will be discussed. Greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms linking the onset of diabetes to statin therapy is essential and clinically relevant, as it may enable novel preventative or therapeutic approaches to be instituted and guide the production of a new generation of statins lacking this side effect."
30617759,"Until today there is a lack of molecular factors, that could predict either cancer malnutrition or cachexia. Among potential mechanisms, that contribute to development of above syndromes, the systemic inflammatory response with overproduction of cytokines and adhesion molecules is the most likely. Recent papers suggested crucial role of P-selectin adhesion molecule in the initiation of leukocytes recruitment to the site of injury during inflammation, promotion of tumor aggressiveness and contribution to cancer cachexia. The aim of the study was to investigate SELP -2028 C/T polymorphism as a risk factor of malnutrition in 66 head and neck cancer (HNC) patients subjected to radiotherapy. Genotyping was conducted by real-time PCR method by means of TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. P-selectin Human ELISA Kit was used to determine P-selectin concentration in each extracted plasma samples. CC homozygous subjects had 4-fold higher risk score of being qualified as severely malnourished compared to other genotype carriers (p = 0.015). However, the TT homozygous patients were at lowest risk of severe weight loss >10% during the therapy period (OR = 0.20; p = 0.019). We also noted, that CC genotype carriers had significantly higher risk of early death incidence compared to CT or TT genotype (median survival time: 29 vs 34 months; HR = 3.02; p = 0.0085). Studied SELP -2028 C/T seems to be a novel attractive predictive factor of cancer malnutrition in HNC patients, perhaps in a future, patients carrying unfavorable CC genotype could be earlier scheduled for pharmaceutical intervention with parenterall nutrition, therefore they could be prevented from the development of severe malnutrition or even cachexia."
30617669,"Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a group of rare, heterogenous eye disorders caused by gene mutations that result in degeneration of the retina. There are currently limited treatment options for IRDs; however, retinal gene therapy holds great promise for the treatment of different forms of inherited blindness. One such IRD for which gene therapy has shown positive initial results is choroideremia, a rare, X-linked degenerative disorder of the retina and choroid. Mutation of the CHM gene leads to an absence of functional Rab escort protein 1 (REP1), which causes retinal pigment epithelium cell death and photoreceptor degeneration. The condition presents in childhood as night blindness, followed by progressive constriction of visual fields, generally leading to vision loss in early adulthood and total blindness thereafter. A recently developed adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV2) vector construct encoding REP1 (AAV2-REP1) has been shown to deliver a functional version of the CHM gene into the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptor cells. Phase 1 and 2 studies of AAV2-REP1 in patients with choroideremia have produced encouraging results, suggesting that it is possible not only to slow or stop the decline in vision following treatment with AAV2-REP1, but also to improve visual acuity in some patients."
30617637,"Gene therapy involving p11 cDNA has been thought to be a futuristic approach for the effective management of depression as the existing treatment regimen presents many issues regarding late onset of action, patient withdrawal and their side effects. For the effective transfection of p11 gene intracellularly, two cationic lipids based on phospholipid DOPE conjugated to basic amino acids histidine and arginine were synthesised, used for liposome formulation and evaluated for their ability as gene delivery vectors. They were further converted using IGF-II mAb into immunoliposomes for CNS targeting and mAb conjugation to liposomes were characterised by SDS-PAGE. They were further analysed by in vitro characterisation studies that include erythrocyte aggregation study, electrolyte-induced study, heparin compatibility study and serum stability studies. SHSY5Y cells were used for conducting cytotoxicity of synthesised lipids and live imaging of cell uptake for 25 min. Finally, the brain distribution studies and western blot were carried out in animals to evaluate them for their BBB permeation ability and effects on p11 protein which is believed to be a culprit. These formulated liposomes from synthesised lipids offer a promising approach for the treatment of depression."
30617306,"Comprehensive molecular characterization of myriad somatic alterations and aberrant gene expressions at personal level is key to precision cancer therapy, yet limited by current short-read sequencing technology, individualized catalog of complete genomic and transcriptomic features is thus far elusive. Here, we integrated second- and third-generation sequencing platforms to generate a multidimensional dataset on a patient affected by metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer. Whole-genome and hybrid transcriptome dissection captured global genetic and transcriptional variants at previously unparalleled resolution. Particularly, single-molecule mRNA sequencing identified a vast array of unannotated transcripts, novel long noncoding RNAs and gene chimeras, permitting accurate determination of transcription start, splice, polyadenylation and fusion sites. Phylogenetic and enrichment inference of isoform-level measurements implicated early functional divergence and cytosolic proteostatic stress in shaping ovarian tumorigenesis. A complementary imaging-based high-throughput drug screen was performed and subsequently validated, which consistently pinpointed proteasome inhibitors as an effective therapeutic regime by inducing protein aggregates in ovarian cancer cells. Therefore, our study suggests that clinical application of the emerging long-read full-length analysis for improving molecular diagnostics is feasible and informative. An in-depth understanding of the tumor transcriptome complexity allowed by leveraging the hybrid sequencing approach lays the basis to reveal novel and valid therapeutic vulnerabilities in advanced ovarian malignancies."
30616689,"Disruptor of telomeric silencing 1-like (DOT1L) is a non-SET domain containing methyltransferase known to catalyze mono-, di-, and tri-methylation of histone 3 on lysine 79 (H3K79me). DOT1L-mediated H3K79me has been implicated in chromatin-associated functions including gene transcription, heterochromatin formation, and DNA repair. Recent studies have uncovered a role for DOT1L in the initiation and progression of leukemia and other solid tumors. The development and availability of small molecule inhibitors of DOT1L may provide new and unique therapeutic options for certain types or subgroups of cancer."
30616682,The role of brown fat in non-shivering thermogenesis and the discovery of brown fat depots in adult humans has made it the subject of intense research interest. A renewable source of brown adipocyte (BA) progenitors would be highly valuable for research and therapy. Directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem (hPS) cells to white or brown adipocytes is limited by lack of cell purity and scalability. Here we describe an alternative approach involving the identification of clonal self-renewing human embryonic progenitor (hEP) cell lines following partial hPS cell differentiation and selection of scalable clones.
30616553,"The risk of recurrence for endocrine-treated breast cancer patients persists for many years or even decades following surgery and apparently successful adjuvant therapy. This period of dormancy and acquired resistance is inherently difficult to investigate; previous efforts have been limited to in-vitro or in-vivo approaches. In this study, sequential tumour samples from patients receiving extended neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy were characterised as a novel clinical model."
30616494,"Ovarian cancer is the fifth-most lethal cancer among women due to a lack of early detection and late-stage treatment options, and it is responsible for more than 14,000 deaths each year in the United States. Recently, there have been advances in RNA interference therapy, specifically with small interfering RNA (siRNA), to reduce tumor burden for ovarian cancer via gene down-regulation. However, delivery of siRNA poses its own challenges, as siRNA is unstable in circulation, is unable to be effectively internalized by cells, and may cause toxicity in off-target sites. To address such challenges, nanoparticle carriers have emerged as delivery platforms for the biocompatible, targeted delivery of siRNA-based therapies. Several preclinical studies have shown the promising effects of siRNA therapy to reduce chemotherapy resistance and proliferation of ovarian cancer cells. This review evaluates the recent advances, clinical applications, and future potential of nanoparticle-mediated delivery of siRNA therapeutics to target genes implicated in ovarian cancer."

30616371,Chronic myeloid leukemia is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder characterized by the BCR-ABL gene rearrangement with translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22. The constitutively active BCR-ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor became the standard frontline therapy. The molecular monitoring is essential.
30616345,"Understanding the fundamental cell-material interactions is essential to designing functional materials for biomedical applications. Although mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are known to secrete cytokines and exosomes that are effective to treat degenerative diseases, the inherent property of biomaterials to modulate the therapeutic function of MSCs remains to be investigated. Here, a multivalent cell-membrane adhesive conjugate was generated through polyamindoamine (PAMAM) and an oligopeptide, IKVAV and the conjugate was further complexed with hyaluronic acids (HA). The adhesive particulates were used to coat the surface of adipose-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (Ad-MSCs) and studied in the MSC spheroid culture. The analysis showed that the adhesive complexes formed via PAMAM conjugates and HA significantly promoted the proliferation and the gene expression of pro-angiogenesis cytokines in MSCs; the production of anti-inflammatory miRNAs in exosomes could also be elevated. The transplantation of the Ad-MSCs primed with PAMAM-IKVAV/HA composite particulates in a rat myocardial infarction model further demonstrated the beneficial effects of membrane-binding materials on improving the cell retention and tissue angiogenesis. The new function of membrane-binding adhesive materials potentially provides useful ways to improve cell-based therapy."
30616324,"A lack of effective drugs and technical means to eradicate hepatitis B virus (HBV) is a bottleneck that limits the ability to fully cure HBV infection. Recently, genome-editing technology based on clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -associated protein 9 is an emerging technique for editing specific gene loci, which can specifically target HBV covalently closed circular DNA, effectively inhibits HBV DNA replication and regulates HBV functional protein expression, and is expected to become a powerful gene therapy tool for the complete eradication of HBV. Considering this, it has become the focus of attention for scholars at home and abroad that how to use clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -associated protein 9 to accomplish modification of HBV genomes for complete eradication of HBV. This paper summarizes the latest progress based on the latest research results at home and abroad in the application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -associated protein 9 gene editing technology in anti-HBV infection treatment, and expounds its potential and challenges as a radical cure for HBV infection."
30616259,"Reasons for failure of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstructions are manifold and require a multifactorial explanatory approach. In addition to technical failures, many modifiable and non-modifiable risk factors for a new ACL injury have to be considered. Technical failures primarily include non-anatomical tibial and femoral tunnel position. In comparison to the transtibial drilling technique, the tibial tunnel-independent technique results in a more anatomical position of the femoral tunnel and should therefore be preferred. One can differentiate between non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors. At the same time, the combination of more than one risk factor increases the risk of injury significantly. Non-modifiable risk factors include genetic predisposition, female sex, young age and ligament hyperlaxity. Young age at the time of the first injury is the most important risk factor for graft failure. Modifiable risk factors include high body mass index (BMI), deficits in jump landing mechanics, a steep posterior tibial slope and narrow intercondylar notch width. Neuromuscular training or additional surgical procedures modify these risk factors and reduce the probability of further injuries. A high tibial osteotomy (HTO) is the surgical procedure of choice for a reduction in the posterior tibial slope and anterior tibial translation. In case of a tibial slope over 12°, this procedure should be considered. In revision anterior cruciate ligament reconstructions with remaining anterolateral rotatory instability, additional lateral extraarticular tenodesis should be taken into account. This is also recommended for patients participating in pivoting sports, having concomitant hyperlaxity or additional injury of peripheral structures with insufficiency of the ACL. In addition, the surface of the pitch can be modified and thus influence the risk of an ACL injury. In summary, a substantiated failure analysis is required to initiate specific and individualised therapy - not only in the case of ACL rerupture. These factors should already be considered in risk assessment during patient information."
30616143,"MEOX2 mutation has been reported as a potential cause of familial Alzheimer's disease. Recently, a novel MEOX2 mutation was identified in a family with Alzheimer's disease. The dermal fibroblasts of the patient were obtained and successfully transformed into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), employing episomal plasmids expressing OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, LIN28, and L-MYC. Our model may offer a good platform for further research on the pathomechanism, drug testing, and gene therapy of this disease."
30615980,"In this issue of BBMT, a multicenter group of investigators convened by the American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation outlines new consensus definitions and grading systems for the most common toxicities associated with immune effector cell therapies, including cytokine release syndrome and the newly named immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome."
30615971,"Unfolded protein response (UPR) is an adaptive mechanism allowing the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to react to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in its lumen, also known as ER stress. The UPR is interconnected with inflammation through several pathways such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production resulting from the protein folding or alternatively, activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) via IRE1, or induction of acute phase response (APR). Lipocalin 2 (LCN2) is one of the APR proteins induced under inflammatory conditions and up-regulated during ER stress. Upon incubation of Lcn2<sup>-/-</sup> and wild type (wt) primary hepatocytes with tunicamycin (TM) or thapsigargin (TG) we found the Lcn2<sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes to react with strong UPR to the ER stress, as evidenced by significantly increased levels of Grp94, Bip and Chop mRNA and protein compared to the wt. TM and TG-treated hepatocytes activated p65 NF-κB and JNK, the pathways that respond to stress stimuli and playing a central role in inflammation and apoptosis, respectively. ER stress further activated and cleaved full-length CREBH/CREB3L3, the hepatocyte specific transcription factor to induce systemic inflammatory responses. Upregulation of the C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) was very prominent in Lcn2<sup>-/-</sup> hepatocytes and sustained until 48 h, resulting in hepatocyte apoptosis as evidenced by increased cleaved caspase 3. We also explored the UPR of the Lcn2 null mouse livers in acute intoxication and inflammation stages with a single application of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>). The Lcn2 null mice clearly developed stronger UPR in LPS- and CCl<sub>4</sub>-induced ER stress compared to the wt. Our findings indicate that the upregulation of LCN2 during ER stress-induced inflammatory responses protects hepatocytes from being overwhelmed by UPR upon liver injury."
30615937,"Telomeres, the terminal nucleoprotein structures of eukaryotic chromosomes, play pleiotropic functions in cellular and organismal aging. Telomere length (TL) varies throughout life due to the influence of genetic factors and to a complex balancing between ""shortening"" and ""elongation"" signals. Telomerase, the only enzyme that can elongate a telomeric DNA chain, and telomeric repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), a long non-coding RNA involved in looping maintenance, play key roles in TL during life. Despite recent advances in the knowledge of TL, TERRA and telomerase activity (TA) biology and their measurement techniques, the experimental and theoretical issues involved raise a number of problems that should carefully be considered by researchers approaching the ""telomere world"". The increasing use of such parameters - hailed as promising clinically relevant biomarkers - has failed to be paralleled by the development of automated and standardized measurement technology. Consequently, associating given TL values to specific pathological conditions involves on the one hand technological issues and on the other clinical-biological issues related to the planning of clinically relevant association studies. Addressing these issues would help avoid major biases in association studies involving TL and a number of outcomes, especially those focusing on psychological and bio-behavioral variables. The main challenge in telomere research is the development of accurate and reliable measurement methods to achieve simple and sensitive TL, TERRA, and TA detection. The discovery of the localization of telomeres and TERRA in cellular and extracellular compartments had added an additional layer of complexity to the measurement of these age-related biomarkers. Since combined analysis of TL, TERRA and TA may well provide more exhaustive clinical information than a single parameter, we feel it is important for researchers in the various fields to become familiar with their most common measurement techniques and to be aware of the respective merits and drawbacks of these approaches."
30615925,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is the inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) affecting the colon and ileum in particular. Increasing IBD prevalence worldwide is alarming, and needs to be resolved. Due to the limited therapeutic efficacy, accompanying adverse effects, dependence, and pharmacokinetics issues of the available therapy, IBD patients have compromised quality of life. Meanwhile, conventional drug delivery systems (DDS) for IBD face many obstacles en-route to the colon, such as physiological and pathophysiological barriers, genetic variability, disease severity, and nutrition status. Therefore, the pH-dependent nanocarrier DDS is a recent advancement that fulfills the need for a more tolerable and effective remedy for IBD. It facilitates localized and targeted action, eliminating systemic adverse effects and unnecessary flushing of the drug from the inflamed colon tissues. The integration of a pH-sensitive polymer as a nanocarrier provides protection in drug transport to the lower region of the GIT. In this review, we will briefly explain IBD pathophysiology, the pros and cons of pH-dependent conventional DDS, and highlight a novel pH-dependent nanocarrier system for treating the disease."
30615691,"Water buffalo mastitis represents a major issue in terms of animal health, cost of therapy, premature culling and decreased milk yeld. The emergence of antibiotic resistance has led to investigate strategies to avoid or reduce antibiotics' based therapies, in particular during subclinical mastitis. The use of Generally Regarded As Safe bacteria (GRAS) such as Lactobacillus rhamnosus to restore the unbalance in mammary gland microbiota could provide potential corrective measures. The aim of this study was to investigate the changes in milk microbiota after the intramammary treatment with inactivated cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus of mammary gland quarters naturally affected by subclinical mastitis as compared to antibiotic therapy.A number of 43 quarters affected by subclinical mastitis with no signs of clinical inflammation and aerobic culture positive for pathogens were included in the study. The experimental design was as follows: 11 quarters were treated with antibiotics, 15 with inactivated cultures of Lactobacillus rhmnosus and 17 with PBS as negative control, by means of intrammary injection. Samples were collected at eight time points, pre- (T-29, T-21, T-15, T-7, T0 days) and post- treatment (T1, T2, and T6 days). Microbiological culture and Somatic Cell Count (SCC) were perfomed on all the samples, and microbiota was determined on milk samples collected at T0 and T6 by amplifying the V4 region of 16S rRNA gene by PCR and sequencing using next generation sequencing technique. Treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus elicited a strong chemotactic response, as determined by a significant increase of leukocytes in milk, but did not change the microbiological culture results of the treated quarters. For what concerns the analysis of the microbiota, the treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus induced the modification in relative abundance of some genera such as Pseudomonas and 5-7N15. As expected, antibiotic treatment caused major changes in microbiota structure with an increase of Methylobacterium relative abundance. No changes were detected after PBS treatment. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrated that the in vivo intrammmary treatment with Lactobacillus rhamnosus has a transient pro-inflammatory activity by increasing SCC and is capable to modify the microbiota of milk after six days from inoculation, albeit slightly, even when the bacterial cultures were heat inactivated. Further studies are necessary to assess the potential use of this GRAS as supportive therapy against mastitis."
30615681,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulatory RNAs that can modulate cell signaling and play key roles in cell state transitions. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) expresses >40 viral miRNAs that manipulate both viral and cellular gene expression patterns and contribute to reprogramming of the host environment during infection. Here, we identified a subset of EBV miRNAs that desensitize cells to B cell receptor (BCR) stimuli, and attenuate the downstream activation of NF-kappaB or AP1-dependent transcription. Bioinformatics and pathway analysis of Ago PAR-CLIP datasets identified multiple EBV miRNA targets related to BCR signal transduction, including GRB2, SOS1, MALT1, RAC1, and INPP5D, which we validated in reporter assays. BCR signaling is critical for B cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation, and for EBV, is linked to reactivation. In functional assays, we demonstrate that EBV miR-BHRF1-2-5p contributes to the growth of latently infected B cells through GRB2 regulation. We further determined that activities of EBV miR-BHRF1-2-5p, EBV miR-BART2-5p, and a cellular miRNA, miR-17-5p, directly regulate virus reactivation triggered by BCR engagement. Our findings provide mechanistic insight into some of the key miRNA interactions impacting the proliferation of latently infected B cells and importantly, governing the latent to lytic switch."
30615673,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small RNA molecules that inhibit gene function by suppressing translation of target genes. However, in primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), the biological significance of miRNAs is largely unknown, although some miRNAs are known to be prognosis markers. Here, we analyzed 847 miRNAs expressed in 27 PCNSL specimens using microarray profiling and surveyed miRNA signature for prognostic prediction. Of these, 16 miRNAs were expressed in 27 PCNSL specimens at a frequency of 48%. Their variable importance measured by Random forest model revealed miR-192, miR-486, miR-28, miR-52, miR-181b, miR-194, miR-197, miR-93, miR-708, and let-7g as having positive effects; miR-29b-2*, miR-126, and miR-182 as having negative effects; and miR-18a*, miR-425, and miR-30d as neutral. After principal component analysis, the prediction formula for prognosis, consisting of the expression values of the above-mentioned miRNAs, clearly divided Kaplan-Meier survival curves by the calculated Z-score (HR = 6.4566, P = 0.0067). The 16 miRNAs were enriched by gene ontology terms including angiogenesis, cell migration and proliferation, and apoptosis, in addition to signaling pathways including TGF-β/SMAD, Notch, TNF, and MAPKinase. Their target genes included BCL2-related genes, HMGA2 oncogene, and LIN28B cancer stem cell marker. Furthermore, three miRNAs including miR-181b, miR-30d, and miR-93, selected from the 16 miRNAs, also showed comparable results for survival (HR = 8.9342, P = 0.0007), suggestive of a miRNA signature for prognostic prediction in PCNSL. These results indicate that this miRNA signature is useful for prognostic prediction in PCNSL and would help us understand target pathways for therapies in PCNSL."
30615612,"Cancer development is driven by series of events involving mutations, which may become fixed in a tumor via genetic drift and selection. This process usually includes a limited number of driver (advantageous) mutations and a greater number of passenger (neutral or mildly deleterious) mutations. We focus on a real-world leukemia model evolving on the background of a germline mutation. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) evolves to secondary myelodysplastic syndrome (sMDS) and/or secondary acute myeloid leukemia (sAML) in 30-40%. The majority of SCN cases are due to a germline ELANE mutation. Acquired mutations in CSF3R occur in >70% sMDS/sAML associated with SCN. Hypotheses underlying our model are: an ELANE mutation causes SCN; CSF3R mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate; in fetal life, hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells expands quickly, resulting in a high probability of several tens to several hundreds of cells with CSF3R truncation mutations; therapeutic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) administration early in life exerts a strong selective pressure, providing mutants with a growth advantage. Applying population genetics theory, we propose a novel two-phase model of disease development from SCN to sMDS. In Phase 1, hematopoietic tissues expand and produce tens to hundreds of stem cells with the CSF3R truncation mutation. Phase 2 occurs postnatally through adult stages with bone marrow production of granulocyte precursors and positive selection of mutants due to chronic G-CSF therapy to reverse the severe neutropenia. We predict the existence of the pool of cells with the mutated truncated receptor before G-CSF treatment begins. The model does not require increase in mutation rate under G-CSF treatment and agrees with age distribution of sMDS onset and clinical sequencing data."
30615496,"Ischemic stroke is becoming a primary cause of disability and death worldwide. To date, therapeutic options remain limited focusing on mechanical thrombolysis or administration of thrombolytic agents. However, these therapies do not promote neuroprotection and neuro-restoration of the ischemic area of the brain. Areas covered: This review highlights the option of minimal invasive, intra-arterial, administration of biological agents for stroke therapy. The authors provide an update of all available studies, discuss issues that influence outcomes and describe future perspectives which aim to improve clinical outcomes. New therapeutic options based on cellular and molecular interactions following an ischemic brain event, will be highlighted. Expert opinion: Intra-arterial administration of biological agents during trans-catheter thrombolysis or thrombectomy could limit neuronal cell death and facilitate regeneration or neurogenesis following ischemic brain injury. Despite the initial progress, further meticulous studies are needed in order to establish the clinical use of stem cell-induced neuroprotection and neuroregeneration."
30614828,"The aims of this study were: 1, to investigate the association between the rs4680 Val158Met polymorphism in frequent episodic (FETTH) and chronic (CTTH) tension-type headache; and 2, to analyse the association between the rs4680 Val158Met polymorphism with clinical, psychological, or psychophysical variables."
30614802,"Lung cancer represents a major healthy concern due to high incidence and morality. Increasing evidences showed critical regulatory role of microRNA (miR) in cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis. It has been indicated that the level of miR-328 is abnormally up regulated in lung cancer cell line, which is correlated with cell apoptosis. An in vitro lung cancer model was established through induction of chlamydia pneumonia. Western blot and real-time quantitative PCR were used to measure miR-328 level and its effects on histone H2AX expression. Bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter gene assay were to determine if H2AX was the direct target of miR-328. TUNEL assay, AV-PI staining and Caspase-3 activity assay measured the effect of the decrease of miR-328 on lung cancer cell apoptosis at both in vivo and in vitro level. Bioinformatics analysis predicted histone H2AX as the target of miR-328 during the regulation of lung cancer. Both in vivo and in vitro knockdown of miR-328 up-regulated H2AX expression and elevated TUNEL-positive cell number. In vivo down-regulation of miR-328 decreased incidence of lung cancer induced by chlamydia pneumoniae, suppressed tumor volume, increased caspase 3 activity, and facilitated tumor cell apoptosis. Histone protein H2AX serves as the target of miR-328 and participates in lung cancer regulation. Suppression of miR-328 level promotes lung cancer tissue apoptosis, which provides novel target for lung cancer therapy."
30614801,"Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a complex disease with extensive genetic and epigenetic defects, including microRNA deregulation. The aims of the present study were to explore the regulatory mechanism of microRNA-18a in OSCC cells proliferation and metastasis. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to detect the expression level of miR-18a and KLF4 mRNA in OSCC tissues and cell lines (SCC-25, CAL-27, Tca-8113). Western-blot analysis was used to validate expression of KLF4 protein. CCK-8 assay was performed to e validate the proliferous ability of human OSCC cells. Transwell assays were performed to determine the migratory and invasive abilities of OSCC in vitro. Dual-luciferase reporter assay, qRT-PCR and Western-blot were used to confirm that miR-18a regulates KLF4 expression in OSCC. miR-18a was significantly up-regulated in human OSCC cell lines (SCC-25, CAL-27, and Tca-8113) and clinical OSCC specimens. miR-18a over-expression markedly promoted human OSCC cell proliferation, invasion, migration in vitro. Bioinformatics analysis made a prediction that KLF4 was the candidate target gene of miR-18a, and western blotting confirmed the negative correlation between miR-18a and KLF4. Additionally, KLF4 was negatively associated with miR-18a in OSCC and abnormal expression of KLF4 attenuated miR-18a-mediated promotion in cell proliferation. In conclusmiR-18a p ion, remoted OSCC proliferation, migration and invasion abilities and suppressed the expression of, KLF4. This newly identified miR-18a/KLF4 axis may provide new insight into the pathogenesis and offers a potential target for OSCC therapy."
30614763,"Past studies on the relationship between Killer cell Immunoglobulin-like Receptor (KIR) and Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) genetic variation and chronic immune activation (CIA) in HIV infection are not uniformly consistent. Moreover, interferon-γ-induced protein 10 (IP-10) is a soluble biomarker of immune activation, with high plasma concentrations predicting accelerated disease progression in HIV infection. Thus, we investigated the association of KIR and HLA-C genetic polymorphisms with plasma IP-10 concentration in 183 treatment-naive chronically HIV-infected adults of Bantu origin from Zimbabwe. KIR genetic variation was determined using allele-specific primer PCR while HLA-C typing was characterized by sequencing. Plasma IP-10 was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The KIR2DL3 gene was significantly associated with CIA as observed from IP-10 concentrations among KIR2DL3 carriers (265.20 pg/mL, IQR: 179.99-385.19) compared with KIR2DL3 noncarriers (183.56 pg/mL; IQR: 110.98-230.81; p = 0.001) and among KIR2DL3+HLA-C2 carriers (226.23 pg/mL, IQR: 187.96-394.73) compared with KIR2DL3+HLA-C2 noncarriers (212.86 pg/mL, IQR: 160.15-344.99; p = 0.017), respectively. Similarly, IP-10 concentrations were significantly higher (p = 0.030) in the KIR3DS1 carriers (313.86 pg/mL, IQR: 230.05-469.20) compared with KIR3DS1 noncarriers (246.01 pg/mL, IQR: 169.58-373.32). Thus, KIR and HLA-C could be playing important roles in HIV-associated immune activation. The elevation of IP-10 in KIR2DL3 and KIR2DL3+C2 could potentially be explained by increased IFN-γ secretion from activated NK cell activation due to the absence of KIR2DL3's cognate C1 ligand. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on a potential link between KIR and HLA-C genetic determinants and plasma IP-10 concentration in this population sample. Future studies are called for in other world populations for biomarkers of disease progression and mechanisms of IP-10 variability in HIV infection."
30614703,"Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are promising gene therapy vectors but may exhibit off-target delivery due to broad tissue tropism. We recently developed a synthetic protease-activatable AAV vector, named provector, that transduces cells preferentially in environments rich in matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) which are elevated in a variety of diseases, including various cancers and heart diseases. The provector displays peptide locks made up of MMP recognition sites flanking an inactivating sequence (IS) composed of four aspartic acid residues (D4). When present, the IS prevents AAV from binding cell receptors and no transduction occurs (OFF state). High levels of MMPs cleave the recognition sequences and release the IS from the capsid surface, restoring cell receptor binding (ON state). The AAV9 provector prototype is not optimal as it displays baseline OFF transduction at 5-10% of that of the wild-type capsid, which can lead to off-target delivery. We hypothesized that changes to the IS may decrease OFF state transduction. We created a provector panel with IS of lengths 0 (D0) to 10 (D10) aspartic acid residues and characterized this panel in vitro. Notably, we find that the D10 provector has an OFF transduction of less than 1% of wild-type capsid and an ON/OFF transduction ratio of 27, the best outcome achieved for any provector thus far. In summary, our results enable us to define new design rules for the provector platform, specifically that (1) the IS is necessary for provector locking and (2) increasing the number of aspartic acid residues in this sequence improves locking."
30614661,"The colonial naked mole rat Heterocephalus glaber is a subterranean, eusocial rodent. The H. glaber vomeronasal organ neuroepithelium (VNE) displays little postnatal growth. However, the VNE remains neuronal in contrast to some mammals that possess nonfunctional vomeronasal organ remnants, for example, catarrhine primates and some bats. Here, we describe the vomeronasal organ (VNO) microanatomy in the naked mole rat and we make preliminary observations to determine if H. glaber shares its minimal postnatal VNE growth with other African mole rats. We also determine the immunoreactivity to the mitotic marker Ki67, growth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), and olfactory marker protein (OMP) in six adult and three subadult H. glaber individuals. VNE volume measurements on a small sample of Cryptomys hottentotus and Fukomys damarensis indicate that the VNE of those African mole rat species are also likely to be growth-deficient. Ki67(+) cells show that the sensory epithelium is mitotically active. GAP43 labelling indicates neurogenesis and OMP(+) cells are present though less numerous compared to GAP43(+) cells. In this respect, the VNO of H. glaber does not appear vestigial. The African mole rat VNE may be unusually variable, perhaps reflecting reduced selection pressure on the vomeronasal system. If so, African mole rats may provide a useful genetic model for understanding the morphological variability observed in the mammalian VNO. Anat Rec, 2019. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."
30614627,"Aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADCD) is a rare inherited disease prevalent in South East Asia. This disease is due to the founder mutation IVS 6 + 4A > T (c.714 + 4A > T), which accounts for most alleles. Patients with this mutation have severe phenotypes. About 90 % of these patients in South East Asia do not have head control and cannot sit, stand, or speak from birth to the time of observation. In 2012, a gene study to treat these patients with intraputamen injection of adeno-associated virus2-human AADC showed prominent motor improvement and an increased PDMS-2 score 12 months after treatment. In addition, systemic gene therapy in a mouse model of AADCD achieved widespread correction of the Ddc gene. In this article, we review the natural history, clinical course, and treatment effects seen in these clinical and mouse studies. Future studies focusing on noninvasive viral vector delivery or alternative emerging treatments may also benefit patients with AADCD."
30614181,"Polyethylenimines (PEIs) are outstanding macromolecules belonging to the polycations used in gene transfection. The transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity of PEIs increase with the increase in their molecular weight. To break up the correlation between transfection efficiency and cytotoxicity for non-viral gene delivery, disulfide cross-linked polyethylenimine (PEI-SS) has been widely employed as highly efficient gene vectors for DNA/siRNA delivery in numerous efforts. In this work, PEI-SS is described as a non-viral vector for miRNA delivery for the first time. PEI-SS is synthesized via cross-linking using disulfide bonds as the cross-linker from low molecular weight PEI. PEI-SS can efficiently bind anti-miR-155 to form the polyplex with nano-sized spherical structures in the size range of 10-100 nm. The polyplex is degraded by glutathione (GSH, a reducing agent) in cancer cells. Anti-miR-155 is then released to efficiently inhibit tumor growth."
30614179,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting upper and lower motor neurons (MNs), resulting in paralysis and precocious death from respiratory failure. Although the causes of ALS are incompletely understood, the role of alterations in RNA metabolism seems central. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs implicated in the regulation of gene expression of many relevant physiological processes, including cell death. The recent model of programmed cell death (PCD) encompasses different mechanisms, from apoptosis to regulated necrosis (RN), in particular necroptosis. Both apoptosis and necroptosis play a significant role in the progressive death of MNs in ALS. In this review, we present key research related to miRNAs that modulate apoptosis and RN pathways in ALS. We also discuss whether these miRNAs represent potential targets for therapeutic development in patients."
30614160,"In order for chairside diagnostic testing to make an impact on dental therapy, practitioners require a better understanding of genetic mutations contributing to the pathophysiology of periodontal disease. Commensal and pathogenic bacterial colonization in oral cavity tissues produces a cascade of proinflammatory signaling pathways ultimately detrimental to host tissues. Resolving inflammation is a multifactorial process involving the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines while allowing commensal bacterial levels to return to normal. Because of the complicated nature of commensal bacteria and oral health homeostasis, the emphasis of dental therapy should place renewed focus on limiting destructive inflammation rather than solely eliminating bacteria. Salivary diagnostics are an easy, non-invasive way to assess inflammatory markers. Inflammatory cytokine levels can help determine the subclinical health of a patient, showing the transition from health to gingivitis, or periodontitis, prior to clinical presentation. Single nucleotide polymorphism mutations can aid in determining increased risk of developing periodontitis. Taken together, and alongside regular clinical evaluations, chairside diagnostics help individualize treatment plans to slow, or halt, the progression of disease-before tissue destruction can take place. While more studies are needed analyzing specific mutations across periodontal categories, chairside diagnostics present an exciting adjunct to improve patient care."
30614120,"To investigate whether metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with exacerbation of inflammatory responses in preeclamptic (PE) patients, the dynamic changes of Th17 and Treg cells, monocytes, cytokines and transcription pattern of inflammasome related genes were analyzed in 35 women with PE suffering from MetS in comparison to 38 PE women without MetS and healthy pregnant women."
30614017,"A ventricular diameter of 10 mm correlates with more than two standard deviations of the normal, hence is qualified as ventriculomegaly. The relevance of it is dependent on whether there are associated infectious, genetic or structural problems. The chance for neurodevelopmental delay in isolated ventriculomegaly less than 15mm is 7.9% (4.7-11.1), and less if it is unilateral. It can be further divided in mild (10-12) or moderate (13-15), though this is not widely accepted. As part of the work-up, structural assessment today may include ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging, or both. Discussants agreed that the diagnostic performance of both methods is as good as the expertise with which the images are acquired and interpreted. Discussants agreed that when the initial neurosonogram is normal, the likelihood of finding significant findings on MRI is low. Nevertheless, some anomalies may only be picked up or better worked out by fetal MRI. In utero follow up is advocated, as progression may indicate a poorer outcome, and some conditions are only obvious late in pregnancy. Most benefit for future patients is expected from appropriate training in prenatal neuro-imaging."
30613905,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) have been applied in prevention from allograft rejection based on their immunomodulatory effects. However, conflicting results have been presented among recent studies, for which one possibility being acknowledged is that the exact effect is determined by the microenvironment when MSCs are applied in vivo. Using a hind limb composite tissue allograft model, we investigate the influence of IFN-γ-preconditioning on the immunomodulatory effects of MSCs and the subsequent allograft survival. Firstly, different doses of IFN-γ were respectively used to incubate with bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs). We found that IFN-γ altered the expression of PD-L1, a major suppressor gene in the immune system during allograft rejection, in a strictly dose-dependent manner in BMSCs. Ten nanograms per milliliter IFN-γ-incubated BMSCs significantly stimulated PD-L1 expression and suppressed T cell proliferation and differentiation, while 50 ng/mL IFN-γ-incubated BMSCs sharply reduced PD-L1 expression. Moreover, we observed that, in contrast to the naive BMSC transplantation group, BMSCs pre-conditioned with 10 ng/mL IFN-γ (BMSCs-IFN-γ) significantly delayed the allograft rejection in vivo. In vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) indicated that BMSCs-IFN-γ inhibited T lymphocyte proliferation and activation via PD-L1. Moreover, BMSCs-IFN-γ did not influence the proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes when PD-L1 protein was neutralized by the PD-L1 antibody. These data collectively reveal a role of recipient ongoing immune microenviroment in BMSC-based immunesuppressive therapy. Graphical abstract ᅟ."
30613837,"The 2016 revised World Health Organization (WHO) classification of lymphoid neoplasms included the category of high-grade B cell lymphomas (HGBLs) with combined MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (double-hit, DH). However, the clinical features of B cell precursor leukemia (BCP-ALL) that harbor DH genetics remain widely unknown. We performed a retrospective analysis of the German Multicenter Study Group for Adult ALL registry and a literature search for de novo DH-BCP-ALLs. We identified 6 patients in the GMALL registry and 11 patients published in the literature between 1983 and June 2018. Patients of all ages (range, 15-86 years) are affected. There is a high incidence of meningeal disease and other extramedullary disease manifestations. Current treatment approaches are mainly ALL-based and are sufficient to induce first complete remissions, but progression-free survival is only 4.0 months (95% CI, 1.5-6.5 months) and all patients succumb to their disease, once relapsed, with a median survival of 5.0 months (95% CI, 3.1-6.9 months), despite intensive salvage and targeted therapy approaches. Of all patients, only two that attained an initial complete remission were alive at data cutoff. In all cases, the BCL2 gene was rearranged to be in proximity to the IGH locus, whereas MYC had various translocation partners juxtaposed. There was no significant survival difference between IG and non-IG translocation partners (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.33-3.2; p = 0.89). In conclusion, de novo DH-BCP-ALL is an aggressive B cell malignancy with deleterious outcome. Physicians have to be aware of this rare disease subset due to the atypical clinical behavior and especially because latest classification systems do not cover this sub-entity."
30613831,"Hepatitis B virus core (HBc) particles acquire the capacity to disassemble and reassemble in a controlled manner, allowing entrapment and delivery of drugs and macromolecules to cells. HBc particles are made of 180-240 copies of 21 kDa protein monomers, assembled into 30-34 nm diameter icosahedral particles. In this study, we aimed at formulating HBc particles for the delivery of siRNA for gene silencing <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. We have previously reported recombinant HBc particles expressing Z<sub>HER2</sub> affibodies, specifically targeting human epidermal growth receptor 2 (HER2)-expressing cancer cells (Z<sub>HER2</sub>-ΔHBc). siRNA was encapsulated within the Z<sub>HER2</sub>-ΔHBc particles following disassembly and reassembly. The Z<sub>HER2</sub>-ΔHBc-siRNA hybrids were able to secure the encapsulated siRNA from serum and nucleases <i>in vitro</i>. Enhanced siRNA uptake in HER2-expressing cancer cells treated with Z<sub>HER2</sub>-ΔHBc-siRNA hybrids was observed compared to the nontargeted HBc-siRNA hybrids in a time- and dose-dependent manner. A successful <i>in vitro</i> polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) gene knockdown was demonstrated in cancer cells treated with Z<sub>HER2</sub>-ΔHBc-siPLK1 hybrids, to levels comparable to commercial transfecting reagents. Interestingly, Z<sub>HER2</sub>-ΔHBc particles exhibit intrinsic capability of reducing the solid tumor mass, independent of siPLK1 therapy, in an intraperitoneal tumor model following intraperitoneal injection."

30613470,"The field of regenerative medicine is growing rapidly with the introduction of new therapies that have the potential to treat and cure serious medical conditions, including rare diseases, for which there are no available treatments. In the United States, the development of novel medical products is regulated and guided by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). As scientific and technological advances are discovered and adopted by the medical industrial enterprise, the FDA's implementation of policies that create a climate conducive to safe development and rapid availability of novel medical products is one of the pillars which support the Agency's mission of protecting and promoting the public health. With advancements in cell modifications and tissue engineering, innovative creation of biomaterials, adoption of three-dimensional bioprinting, and rapid development of human genome editing technologies, the need for Agency's work in ensuring that its science-based policies remain relevant and helpful in facilitating the availability of new treatments to the most vulnerable populations of patients becomes more pressing than ever before. In December 2016, Congress amended section 506 of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&C) Act [21 U.S.C. 356] by adding a new section 506(g), which defines the categories of products considered to be regenerative medicine therapies. As further described by FDA [1], regenerative medicine therapies are considered to include cell therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies, as well as gene therapies, including genetically modified cells that lead to a durable modification of cells or tissues. The development and approval of regenerative medicine therapies are regulated by FDA's Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT) in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER). In this review article, we present practical considerations for investigating regenerative medicine therapies intended for the treatment of rare diseases. The material presented may be useful to researchers who are undertaking the challenging task of finding and delivering new treatments for those in need."
30613381,"The updated edition of the Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissues, published in September 2017 by the World Health Organization (WHO), presents many important changes to the document published in 2008. Most of these novelties are linked to the exceptional development of biomolecular techniques during the last 10 years. To illustrate how much new technologies have contributed to the better classification of single entities, as well as the discovery of new ones, would go beyond the objectives of this work. For this reason, we will take diffuse large B-cell lymphoma as an example of the cognitive improvement produced by high-yield technologies (such as the gene expression profile, the study of copy number variation, and the definition of the mutational spectrum). The acquisition of this knowledge not only has a speculative value but also represents the elements for effective application in daily practice. On the one hand, it would allow the development of personalised therapy programs, and on the other it would promote the transition from the bench of the researcher's laboratory to the patient's bedside."
30613352,"The metabolic protein alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is significantly overexpressed in prostate cancer compared to the normal prostate and other non-malignant tissue. Though an attractive target, there are no reports in the literature on leveraging the expression of AMACR for the molecular imaging of prostate cancer. Here, we used a molecular-genetic imaging strategy to exploit the transcriptional specificity of the AMACR promoter for the <i>in vivo</i> detection of prostate cancer using the reporter gene luciferase. We performed a stepwise truncation of the promoter and identified a 565 base pair minimal promoter for AMACR that retained both high activity and specificity. Following identification of the minimal promoter for AMACR, we used an advanced two-step transcriptional amplification system to maximize the promoter output. We showed that our optimized AMACR promoter can drive expression of luciferase for molecular imaging in subcutaneous xenograft models of androgen receptor-positive and androgen receptor-negative prostate cancer using a non-replicative adenovirus for gene delivery. Our results provide evidence that the AMACR promoter can be exploited to drive the cancer-specific expression of reporter genes and potentially even be incorporated into conditionally replicative adenoviruses for oncolytic therapy and other applications."
30613307,"Estrogen receptor-positive, progesterone receptor-negative, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative (ER+PR-HER2-) breast cancer comprise a special type of breast cancer that constitutes ~10% of all breast cancer patients. ER+PR-HER2- tumor benefits less from endocrine therapy, while its genomic features remain elusive. In this study, we systematically assessed the multiomic landscape and endocrine responsiveness of ER+PR-HER2- breast cancer. <b>Methods:</b> This study incorporated five cohorts. The first and second cohorts were from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (n=130,856) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (n=1,055) for analyzing survival outcomes and endocrine responsiveness. The third cohort was from The Cancer Genome Atlas (n=630) for multiomic analysis and endocrine-resistant subgroup exploration. The fourth cohort, from the MD Anderson database (n=92), was employed to assist gene selection. The fifth cohort was a prospective observational cohort from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center (n=245) that was utilized to validate the gene-defined subgroup by immunohistochemistry (IHC). <b>Results:</b> Clinically, ER+PR-HER2- tumors showed lower endocrine responsiveness than did ER+PR+HER2- tumors. Genomically, copy number loss or promoter methylation of PR genes occurred in 75% of ER+PR-HER2- tumors, collectively explaining PR loss. ER+PR-HER2- tumors had higher <i>TP53</i> (30.3% vs. 17.0%) and lower <i>PIK3CA</i> mutation rates (25.8% vs. 42.7%) and exhibited more <i>ZNF703</i> (21.5% vs. 13.6%) and <i>RPS6KB1</i> (18.5% vs. 7.8%) amplification events than ER+PR+HER2- tumors. Among ER+PR-HER2- tumors, nearly 20% were of the PAM50-defined non-luminal-like subgroup and manifested lower endocrine sensitivity scores and enriched biosynthesis, metabolism and DNA replication pathways. We further identified the non-luminal-like subgroup using three IHC markers, GATA3, CK5, and EGFR. These IHC-defined non-luminal-like (GATA3-negative, CK5-positive and/or EGFR-positive) tumors received limited benefit from adjuvant endocrine therapy. <b>Conclusion:</b> ER+PR-HER2- breast cancer consists of clinically and genomically distinct groups that may require different treatment strategies. The non-luminal-like subgroup was associated with reduced benefit from endocrine therapy."
30613264,"Alteration of the extracellular matrix (ECM) is one of the major events in the pathogenesis of brain lesions following ischemic stroke. Heparan sulfate mimetics (HSm) are synthetic pharmacologically active polysaccharides that promote ECM remodeling and tissue regeneration in various types of lesions. HSm bind to growth factors, protect them from enzymatic degradation and increase their bioavailability, which promotes tissue repair. As the ECM is altered during stroke and HSm have been shown to restore the ECM, we investigated the potential of HSm4131 (also named RGTA-4131®) to protect brain tissue and promote regeneration and plasticity after a stroke. <b>Methods:</b> Ischemic stroke was induced in rats using transient (1 h) intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo). Animals were assigned to the treatment (HSm4131; 0.1, 0.5, 1.5, or 5 mg/kg) or vehicle control (saline) groups at different times (1, 2.5 or 6 h) after MCAo. Brain damage was assessed by MRI for the acute (2 days) and chronic (14 days) phases post-occlusion. Functional deficits were evaluated with a battery of sensorimotor behavioral tests. HSm4131-<sup>99m</sup>Tc biodistribution in the ischemic brain was analyzed between 5 min and 3 h following middle cerebral artery reperfusion. Heparan sulfate distribution and cellular reactions, including angiogenesis and neurogenesis, were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and growth factor gene expression (VEGF-A, Ang-2) was quantified by RT-PCR. <b>Results:</b> HSm4131, administered intravenously after stroke induction, located and remained in the ischemic hemisphere. HSm4131 conferred long-lasting neuroprotection, and significantly reduced functional deficits with no alteration of physiological parameters. It also restored the ECM, and increased brain plasticity processes, i.e., angiogenesis and neurogenesis, in the affected brain hemisphere. <b>Conclusion:</b> HSm represent a promising ECM-based therapeutic strategy to protect and repair the brain after a stroke and favor functional recovery."
30613263,"Increasing evidence demonstrates the existence of two inter-convertible states of breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) with distinct behaviors in proliferation and mobility, and the BCSC heterogeneity is accurately regulated by sophisticated mechanisms including microRNAs. The microRNA-200 family including miR-200c/141 cluster was reported to affect cancer cell invasion and metastasis by regulating epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the effect of miR-200 family on BCSC heterogeneity is uncertain. Thus, we investigated whether the miR-200c/141 cluster had different effects on breast tumor growth and metastasis by switching the two states of BCSC. <i>Methods</i>: The spontaneous mammary tumor mouse model with miR-200c/141 conditional knockout was utilized for analyzing the role of miR-200c/141 cluster <i>in vivo</i>. The effect of miR-200c/141 cluster on BCSCs was performed by CD24/CD29 staining and ALDEFLUOR assay. miR-200c/141 target expression and EMT-related marker expression were verified in tumor sections, primary cells and breast cancer cell lines by qRT-PCR or western blotting. Statistical analysis was determined using two-way ANOVA and Student's t-test. All values were presented as the mean ± s.e.m. <i>Results</i>: The deletion of miR-200c/141 cluster regulated BCSC heterogeneity and promoted the EMT-like BCSC generation, which resulted in increased tumor metastasis and inhibited tumor growth by directly upregulating the target gene homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 1 (HIPK1) and sequential β-catenin activation. <i>Conclusions</i>: Our results indicated that miR-200c/141 played biphasic roles in breast tumor progression via affecting the BCSC heterogeneity, suggesting targeting BCSC heterogeneity to simultaneously restrict breast cancer initiation and metastasis could be a promising therapeutic strategy for breast cancer."

30613036,"For more than half a century, we have lived in a world dominated by the idea that the gene is the central and primary agent in biology, an era some have called the ""Genetic Age."" Each decade since the discovery of the double-helical structure of DNA in 1953 has seen scientific advances in genetics, discoveries that have led to at least 17 Nobel Prizes. Although the time span occupied by the Genetic Age has also been a time of great public health advances, no advance in human molecular genetics can be shown to have had any measurable effect on any public health parameter of importance. It is hard to think of another field of biomedical research in which such massive public fund investments have had less public health impact to date than human molecular genetics. The only arena in which precision medicine, with its reliance on human genomic information, is likely to be helpful, is selected inherited diseases. To measurably alter the health of the population, the focus of biomedical research should be on the molecular, cellular, clinical, and population effects of the external agents and exposures that drive the incidence of most health conditions."
30612738,"Genomic instability can be a hallmark of both human genetic disease and cancer. We identify a deleterious UBQLN4 mutation in families with an autosomal recessive syndrome reminiscent of genome instability disorders. UBQLN4 deficiency leads to increased sensitivity to genotoxic stress and delayed DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair. The proteasomal shuttle factor UBQLN4 is phosphorylated by ATM and interacts with ubiquitylated MRE11 to mediate early steps of homologous recombination-mediated DSB repair (HRR). Loss of UBQLN4 leads to chromatin retention of MRE11, promoting non-physiological HRR activity in vitro and in vivo. Conversely, UBQLN4 overexpression represses HRR and favors non-homologous end joining. Moreover, we find UBQLN4 overexpressed in aggressive tumors. In line with an HRR defect in these tumors, UBQLN4 overexpression is associated with PARP1 inhibitor sensitivity. UBQLN4 therefore curtails HRR activity through removal of MRE11 from damaged chromatin and thus offers a therapeutic window for PARP1 inhibitor treatment in UBQLN4-overexpressing tumors."
30612555,"Gastric cancer (GC) is a common malignant disease worldwide. Aberrant miRNAs expression contributes to malignant cells behaviour, and in preclinical research, miRNA targeting has shown potential for improving GC therapy. Our present study demonstrated that miR-632 promotes GC progression in a trefoil factor 1 (TFF1)-dependent manner."
30612497,"MDA-7/Interleukin-24 (IL-24), as a pleiotropic cytokine, exhibits a specific tumor suppression property that has attracted a great deal of attention. While its anti-tumor induction is mostly attributed to endogenous gene expression, attachment of secreted MDA-7/IL-24 to cognate receptors also triggers the death of cancerous cell via different pathways. Therefore, precise targeting of secreted MDA-7/IL-24 to tumor cells would render it more efficacy and specificity. Areas covered: In order to target soluble cytokines, particularly MDA-7/IL-24 to the neighbor tumor sites and enhance their therapeutic efficiency, fusing with cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) or Tumor homing peptides (THPs) seems logical due to the improvement of their bystander effects. Although the detailed anti-tumor mechanisms of endogenous mda-7/IL-24 have been largely investigated, the significance of the secreted form in these activities and methods of its improving by CPPs or THPs need more discussion. Expert opinion: While the employment of CPPs/THPs for the improvement of cytokine gene therapy is desirable, to create fusions of CPPs/THPs with MDA-7/IL-24, some hurdles are not avoidable. Regarding our expertise, herein, the importance of CPPs/THPs, needs for their elegant designing in a fusion structure, and their applications in cytokine gene therapy are discussed with a special focus on mda-7/IL-24."
30612418,"Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, including in Korea. Systemic therapy including platinum-based chemotherapy and targeted therapy should be provided to patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Applications of targeted therapy, such as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitors, in patients with NSCLC and an EGFR mutation or ALK gene rearrangement has enabled dramatic improvements in efficacy and tolerability. Despite advances in research and a better understanding of the molecular pathways of NSCLC, few effective therapeutic options are available for most patients with NSCLC without druggable targets, especially for patients with squamous cell NSCLC. Immune checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 or anti-programmed death-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) have demonstrated durable response rates across a broad range of solid tumors, including NSCLC, which has revolutionized the treatment of solid tumors. Here, we review the current status and future approaches of immune checkpoint inhibitors that are being investigated for NSCLC with a focus on pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, durvalumab, and ipilimumab."

Two isogenic hiPSCs lines, with heterozygous and homozygous correction of c.992_993delCA mutation in the MERTK gene were generated. These cell lines demonstrate normal karyotype, maintain a pluripotent state, and can differentiate toward three germ layers in vitro. These genetically corrected hiPSCs represent accurate controls to study the contribution of the specific genetic change to the disease, and potentially therapeutic material for cell-replacement therapy."
30611990,"A microRNA (miRNA) is a single-stranded, small and non-coding RNA molecule that contains 20-25 nucleotides. More than 2000 miRNAs have been identified in human genes since the first miRNA was discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans in the early 1990s. miRNAs play a crucial role in various biological processes by regulating gene expression through post-transcriptional mechanisms. The alterations of their levels are associated with various diseases, such as glucometabolic disorder and lipid metabolism disorder. In recent years, miRNAs have been proved to be involved in regulating the functions of pancreatic β-cells, insulin resistance and other biological behaviors related to glucometabolic disorder and the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus (DM). This review summarized specific miRNAs, including miRNA-375 (miR-375), miRNA-155 (miR-155), miRNA-21 (miR-21), miRNA-33 (miR-33), the let-7 family and some other miRNAs related to glucometabolic regulation, introduced the obstacles and challenges in miRNA therapy, and discussed the prospect of new treatment methods for glucometabolic disorder."

30611792,"Combined photothermal and gene therapy provides a promising modality toward cancer treatment, yet facile integration and controlled codelivery of gene payloads and photothermal conversion agents (PTCAs) remains a great challenge. Inspired by the robust wet adhesion of marine mussels, we present a rationally designed nanosystem constructed by using hybrid mesoporous polydopamine nanoparticles (MPDA) with sub-100 nm sizes and a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 37%. The surface of the particles were modified with tertiary amines by the facile Michael addition/Schiff base reactions of PDA to realize high siRNA loading capacity (10 wt%). Moreover, a successful calcium phosphate (CaP) coating via biomineralization was constructed on the cationic nanoparticle to prohibit premature release of siRNA. The CaP coating underwent biodegradation in weakly-acidic subcellular conditions (lysosomes). The synergistic integration of tertiary amines and catechol moieties on the subsequently exposed surfaces was demonstrated to feature the destabilization/disruption ability toward model cellular membranes via the greatly enhanced interfacial adhesion and interactions. Consequently, sufficient permeability of lysosomal membranes, and in turn, a high lysosomal escape efficiency, was realized, which then resulted in high gene silencing efficiencies via sufficient cytosolic delivery of siRNA. When an efficient knocking down (65%) of survivin (an inhibitor of apoptosis proteins) was combined with a subsequent photothermal ablation, remarkably higher therapeutic efficiencies were observed both in vitro and in vivo, as compared with monotherapy. The system may help to pave a new avenue on the utilization of bio-adhesive surfaces for handling the obstacles of combined photothermal and gene therapy. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Polydopamine (PDA) based porous photothermal-conversion agent (PTCA) with sufficiently high conversion efficiency was employed to deliver photothermal/gene therapy modalities towards cancer treatment. CaP coating via PDA-induced biomineralization was constructed to prohibit premature release of siRNA loaded in the pore space of the nanocarriers. Responsive degradation of CaP also led to the exposure of membrane-lytic surfaces built through the synergistic integration of tertiary amines and catechol moieties, and in turn the significantly enhanced lysosomal escape and cytosol siRNA delivery. Therapeutic targeting of survivin was successfully applied for activation of apoptosis and programmed cell death. Combined photothermal and gene therapy improved therapeutic effectiveness."
30611741,"Medulloblastoma is the most prevalent central nervous system tumor in children. Targeted treatment approaches for patients with high-risk medulloblastoma are needed as current treatment regimens are not curative in many cases and cause significant therapy-related morbidity. Medulloblastoma harboring MYC amplification have the most aggressive clinical course and worst outcome. Targeting the BET protein BRD4 has significant anti-tumor effects in preclinical models of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma, however, in most cases these are not curative. We here assessed the therapeutic efficacy of the orally bioavailable BRD4 inhibitor, MK-8628, in preclinical models of medulloblastoma. MK-8628 showed therapeutic efficacy against in vitro and in vivo models of MYC-amplified medulloblastoma by inducing apoptotic cell death and cell cycle arrest. Gene expression analysis of cells treated with MK-8628 showed that anti-tumor effects were accompanied by significant repression of MYC transcription as well as disruption of MYC-regulated transcriptional programs. Additionally, we found that targeting of MYC protein stability through pharmacological PLK1 inhibition showed synergistic anti-medulloblastoma effects when combined with MK-8628 treatment. Thus, MK-8628 is effective against preclinical high-risk medulloblastoma models and its effects can be enhanced through simultaneous targeting of PLK1."
30611663,"Myocardial infarction (MI) and heart failure (HF) are the leading causes of death in the United States and in most other industrialized nations. MI leads to a massive loss of cardiomyocytes (CMs), which are replaced with non-CM cells, leading to scarring and, in most cases, HF. The adult mammalian heart has a low intrinsic regenerative capacity, mainly because of cell-cycle arrest in CMs. No effective treatment promoting heart regeneration is currently available. Recent efforts to use DNA-based or viral gene therapy approaches to induce cardiac regeneration post-MI or in HF conditions have encountered major challenges, mostly because of the poor and uncontrolled delivery of the introduced genes. Modified mRNA (modRNA) is a safe, non-immunogenic, efficient, transient, local, and controlled nucleic acid delivery system that can overcome the obstacles to DNA-based or viral approaches for cardiac gene delivery. We here review the use of modRNA in cardiac therapy, to induce cardioprotection and vascular or cardiac regeneration after MI. We discuss the current challenges in modRNA-based cardiac treatment, which will need to be overcome for the application of such treatment to ischemic heart disease."
30611646,"Conversion of androgen-responsive prostate cancer (CaP) to castration-resistant CaP is associated with an acceleration of the disease that often requires treatment modalities other than androgen deprivation therapy only. Recently, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) has been shown to play a role in CaP growth, and clinical data showed that high serum concentration of FSH in chemically castrated CaP patients was associated with a shorter time of progression to castration-resistant CaP. In this study, we sought to investigate if FSH could have direct effects on CaP cells, possibly through the androgen receptor and androgen receptor regulated genes, such as prostate-specific antigen (PSA)."
30611637,"This study investigated the molecular and phenotypic characteristics of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and identified the risk factors underlying its acquisition. We evaluated K. pneumoniae isolated in Nagasaki University Hospital between January 2009 and June 2015. The presence of carbapenemase genes and plasmid characteristics were investigated. We performed multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and generated a dendrogram based on the results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for carbapenemase-producing strains. We also performed a case-control study of patients. Of the 88 K. pneumoniae strains that showed minimum inhibitory concentration ≥1 μg/mL for imipenem and/or meropenem, and that were available from our bacterial collection, 18 had the IMP-type carbapenemase gene, all of which were IMP-1 according to sequencing analysis. Strains included seven different sequence types (STs), of which the most common was ST1471. A dendrogram showed the significant similarity of some strains with relationships in PFGE patterns, STs, and the wards in which they were isolated. Plasmid incompatibility group was similar among the IMP-1 producers. Regarding risk factors, multivariate analysis showed that liver disease and previous uses of carbapenems and anti-fungal drugs were significant factors for the acquisition of IMP-1-producing strains. Our results demonstrate that IMP-1 is a major carbapenemase produced by K. pneumoniae. The PFGE results indicated the possibility of transmission in the hospital. The identified risk factors should be considered for appropriate antibiotic therapy and infection-control measures."

30611458,"The prevalence of Fabry disease (FD) in adult patients with suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) has been reported between 0.3% and 4%. Fabry disease-specific therapy necessitates early diagnosis; however, the optimal screening strategy and cost efficacy of routine α-galactosidase A (α-gal A) vs comprehensive galactosidase alpha gene (GLA) testing remain poorly understood. We identified 1192 patients who underwent routine α-gal A screening between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2017, for suspected HCM. Cost efficacy was explored using prevalence and cost estimates. Ten patients had reduced α-gal A enzyme activity, and 5 (3 women) were ultimately diagnosed with FD (prevalence estimate, 0.42%). An alternative cardiac diagnosis was made in 3 patients with mildly reduced enzyme activity. Two women with reduced borderline enzyme levels did not undergo confirmatory testing, but FD was not suspected. The number needed to screen to diagnose 1 patient with FD in a similar cohort is estimated at 238 (5 new cases per 1192 at-risk individuals) at a cost of approximately US $24,000 per diagnosis. We identified a 0.42% prevalence of FD using routine α-gal A screening in adult patients referred to a dedicated HCM center in the United States. Compared with more comprehensive genetic testing strategies, we identified a similar prevalence of FD at a lower cost per diagnosis."
30611408,"Couples at risk for autosomal recessive congenital adrenal hyperplasia often request anticipatory guidance and genetic counseling. Initially, hormones in amniotic fluid were measured to distinguish affected female fetuses from unaffected fetuses. With the molecular era, more-targeted approaches became possible. Prenatal genetic diagnosis via amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling was used to determine the need for continuing fetal therapy (dexamethasone), allowing cessation if the fetus was unaffected. Newer methods now allow diagnosis earlier in gestation, further shortening the treatment time for unaffected female fetuses who will not develop genital ambiguity. Preimplantation genetic testing permits transfer only of an unaffected female or male fetus. Analysis of maternal cell-free DNA based on quantitative differences in the amount of allele parental DNA permits affected pregnancies to be differentiated from unaffected pregnancies."

30611189,"Tumor samples are heterogeneous. They consist of varying cell populations or subclones and each subclone is characterized with a distinct single nucleotide variant (SNV) profile. This explains the source of genetic heterogeneity observed in tumor sequencing data. To make precise prognosis and design effective therapy for cancer, ascertaining the subclonal composition of a tumor is of great importance."
30611057,"As part of an effort to identify druggable diacylglycerol kinase alpha (DGKα) inhibitors, we used an in-silico approach based on chemical homology with the two commercially available DGKα inhibitors R59022 and R59949. Ritanserin and compound AMB639752 emerged from the screening of 127 compounds, showing an inhibitory activity superior to the two commercial inhibitors, being furthermore specific for the alpha isoform of diacylglycerol kinase. Interestingly, AMB639752 was also devoid of serotoninergic activity. The ability of both ritanserin and AMB639752, by inhibiting DGKα in intact cells, to restore restimulation induced cell death (RICD) in SAP deficient lymphocytes was also tested. Both compounds restored RICD at concentrations lower than the two previously available inhibitors, indicating their potential use for the treatment of X-linked lymphoproliferative disease 1 (XLP-1), a rare genetic disorder in which DGKα activity is deregulated."
30610920,"Rare-disease drug development is both scientifically and commercially challenging. This case study highlights Agilis Biotherapeutics (Agilis), a small private biotechnology company that has developed the most clinically advanced adeno-associated virus (AAV) gene therapy for the brain. In an international collaboration led by Agilis with National Taiwan University (NTU) Hospital and the Therapeutics for Rare and Neglected Diseases (TRND) program of the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS) at the National Institutes of Health, Agilis' gene therapy for aromatic l-amino acid decarboxylase deficiency (AADC), AGIL-AADC, was granted biologics license application (BLA)-ready status by the FDA in 2018, only 18 months after being licensed from NTU by Agilis.

30610881,"Obesity affects 600 million people globally and over one third of the American population. Along with associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer; the direct and indirect costs of managing obesity are 21% of the total medical costs. These factors shed light on why developing effective and pragmatic strategies to reduce body weight in obese individuals is a major public health concern. An estimated 60-70% of obese Americans attempt to lose weight each year, with only a small minority able to achieve and maintain long term weight loss. To address this issue a precision medicine approach for weight loss has been considered, which places an emphasis on sustainability and real-world application to individualized therapy. In this article we review weight loss interventions in the context of precision medicine and discuss the role of genetic and epigenetic factors, pharmacological interventions, lifestyle interventions, and bariatric surgery on weight loss."
30610878,"Lung cancer is a leading lethal disease with a 5-year survival rate of only 16%. Inadequate potent anti-cancer drugs appear to be a bottleneck in the treatment of lung cancer; hence, how to develop effective anti-lung cancer therapeutics is an urgent problem. In this study, we aim to explore a novel compound with potent anti-lung cancer effect and study its anti-cancer mechanisms. We found that triptonide at very low concentrations of 5-10 nM caused a marked suppression of cell proliferation and colony formation of lung cancer cells. More interestingly, triptonide also robustly inhibited the lung cancer cell formation of tumor spheres, and reduced the stemness and tumorigenicity of the sphere-forming cells. In vivo studies showed that administration of triptonide significantly inhibited the tumor growth with low toxicity. Molecular mechanistic studies revealed that triptonide significantly decreased expression of the Gli1 at both mRNA and protein levels by repressing Gli1 gene promoter activity. Additionally, triptonide reduced the levels of cancer stem cell key signaling protein sonic hedgehog (Shh), but increased the amount of Ptch1, a protein binding to SMO to diminish the Shh signal transduction, thus inhibition of the Shh-Gli1 signaling pathway. Together, our findings show that triptonide effectively inhibits lung cancer cell growth, stemness, and tumorigenicity, and support the notion that triptonide is a new Shh-Gli1 signaling inhibitor and a novel anti-lung cancer drug candidate for further developing effective lung cancer therapeutics."

30610755,"Programmable DNA nanostructures are a new class of biocompatible, nontoxic nanomaterials. Nevertheless, their application in the field of biomedical research is still in its infancy, especially as drug delivery vehicles for gene therapy. In this study, a GTPase Rab26 was explored as a new potential therapeutic target using precisely tailored DNA prism for targeted lung cancer therapy. Specifically, a DNA prism platform with tunable targeting and siRNA loading capability is designed and synthesized. The DNA prisms were decorated with two functional units: a Rab26 siRNA as the drug and MUC-1 aptamers as targeting moiety for non-small cell lung cancer. The number and position of both siRNA and MUC-1 aptamer can be readily tuned. Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and dynamic light scattering technique (DLS) demonstrate that all nanoprisms with different functionalities are self-assembled with high yield. It is also found that the cellular uptake of DNA prims is proportional to the aptamer number on each nanoprism, and the as-prepared DNA nanoprism show excellent anti-cancer activities and targeting capability. Current study suggest that by careful design, self-assembled DNA nanostructures are highly promising, customizable, multifuncitonal nanoplatform for potential biomedical applications, such as personalized precision therapy in the near future."
30610665,"Since the discovery and classification of non-coding RNAs, their roles have gained great attention. In this respect, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs have been firmly demonstrated to be linked to regulation of gene expression and onset of human diseases, including rare genetic diseases; therefore they are suitable targets for therapeutic intervention. This issue, in the context of rare genetic diseases, is being considered by an increasing number of research groups and is of key interest to the health community. In the case of rare genetic diseases, the possibility of developing personalized therapy in precision medicine has attracted the attention of researchers and clinicians involved in developing ""orphan medicinal products"" and proposing these to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) in the United States. The major focuses of these activities are the evaluation and development of products (drugs, biologics, devices, or medical foods) considered to be promising for diagnosis and/or treatment of rare diseases or conditions, including rare genetic diseases. In an increasing number of rare genetic diseases, analysis of microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs has been proven a promising strategy. These diseases include, but are not limited to, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, cystic fibrosis, Rett syndrome, and β-thalassemia. In conclusion, a large number of approaches based on targeting microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs are expected in the field of molecular diagnosis and therapy, with a facilitated technological transfer in the case of rare genetic diseases, in virtue of the existing regulation concerning these diseases."
30610662,"Infertility due to Gonadotropin-Resistant Ovary Syndrome (GROS) is a rare type of hypergonadotropic hypogonadism. Here, we report an original case of GROS, associated with compound heterozygous follicle-stimulating hormone receptor (FSHR) variants, in a woman who achieved a live birth by in vitro maturation (IVM) of her oocytes. This 31-year-old woman consulted our assisted reproduction center for a second opinion after having been advised, because of pervasive high serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, to pursue in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor oocytes. She presented with primary infertility and progressively prolonged menstrual cycles. Her serum FSH levels were indeed found to be high, but in discordance with a normal anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level and antral follicle count. Genetic investigation found the patient to be compound heterozygous for two FSHR variants: I160T, a known pathologic variant, and N558H, which has never been previously reported. As there was no ovarian response to high daily doses of exogenous gonadotropins, IVM was proposed to the patient with success and she finally delivered at term a healthy boy. Effects of the receptor variants were analyzed in heterologous cells. Whereas the I160T mutation blocked FSHR membrane trafficking and FSH-stimulated cAMP-dependent signaling in transfected CHO cells, the novel variant, N558H, functioned equivalently to wild-type FSHR in the assays employed. In conclusion, IVM should always be offered as a first-line therapy to infertile women presenting with GROS. The N558H variant discovered in FSHR is novel, but its functional significance, if any, is unresolved and merits further investigation as it may be associated with a recessive FSHR-related disorder."
30610589,"This study aimed to explore the molecular mechanism of stroke and provide a new target in the clinical management. The miRNA dataset GSE97532 (3 blood samples from middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and 3 from sham operation) and mRNA dataset GSE97533 (3 blood samples from MCAO and 3 from sham operation) were obtained from GEO database. Differentially expressed mRNA (DEGs) and miRNAs (DEMIRs) were screened out between MCAO and sham operation groups. Then, DEMIR-DEG interactions were explored and visualized using Cytoscape software. Moreover, the enrichment analysis was performed on these DEMIRs and DEGs. Furthermore, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Finally, the DEG-target transcription factors (TFs) were investigated using the WebGestal software. The current bioinformatics analysis revealed 38 DEMIRs and 546 DEGs between MCAO and sham operation groups. The DEMIR-DEG analysis revealed 370 relations, such as miR-107-5p-Furin. The top 10 up- and downregulated DEMIRs were mainly enriched in pathways like cAMP signaling pathway. The PPI network analysis revealed 2 modules. The target DEGs of the 10 up- and downregulated DEMIRs in 2 modules were mainly assembled in functions like ATP binding and pathway including ABC transporters. Furthermore, the DEG-TF network analysis identified 5 outstanding TFs including androgen receptor (AR). miR107-5p might take part in the progression of stroke via inhibiting the expression of Furin. TFs like AR might be used as a novel gene therapy target for stroke. Furthermore, cAMP signaling pathway and ATP binding function might be a novel breakthrough for stroke treatment."
30610510,"Mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) are promising tools in regenerative medicine and targeted therapies. Although different origins have been described, there is still huge need to find a valuable source harboring specific subpopulations of MSCs with precise therapeutic functions. Here, we isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting technique, two populations of Wharton's jelly (WJ)-MSCs based on their aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity. Two different ALDH activities (low vs. high) were thus observed. We then analyzed their gene expression profile for stemness, phenotype, response to hypoxia, angiogenesis, hematopoietic support, immunomodulation and multilineage differentiation abilities (osteogenesis, adipogenesis, and chondrogenesis). According to ALDH activity, many differences in the mRNA expression of these populations were noticed. In conclusion, we provide evidences that WJ harbors two distinct populations of MSCs with different ALDH activity. These populations seem to display specific functional competences that may be interesting for concise therapeutic applications."
30610504,"MicroRNAs are small functional RNAs that modulate various biological processes in cells by interfering with gene translation. We have previously demonstrated that certain miRNAs play a crucial role in the innate immune responses of human oral epithelial cells to Porphyromonas gingivalis. While addressing the mechanisms of P. gingivalis induced apoptosis in these cells, we discovered that certain miRNAs are upregulated upon stimulation with live bacteria. These upregulated miRNAs include hsa-miR-584, hsa-miR-572, hsa-miR-210, hsa-miR-492, hsa-miR-623 and hsa-miR-663. Further analysis revealed an unexpected role for hsa-miR-663 (miR-663). To further evaluate miR-663 function, we overexpressed miR-663 in epithelial cells which resulted in cellular apoptosis. The bioinformatics analysis of the miR-663 target prediction, revealed a strong binding affinity to a 3' UTR region of Apoptosis Antagonizing Transcription Factor (AATF) mRNA. To demonstrate the binding of miR-663 to AATF mRNA, the putative miR-663 target site within the 3'-UTR region of AATF was cloned in luciferase vector and transfected to HEK293T cells. Luminescence data showed the downregulation of luciferase activity in cells that had the full length target region of the putative binding site, confirming that AATF is one of the targets for miR-663. This prompted us to further evaluate its role in a cancer cell line (MCF-7) to determine miR-663s' apoptotic function. The overexpression of miR-663 led to a significant increase in apoptosis of MCF-7 cells. Taken together, miR-663 may function as an 'apoptomiR' by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic gene AATF to induce apoptosis. These findings could have therapeutic implications for epithelial cell targeting in cancer therapy."

BCR-ABL leukemias result from leukemic stem cell/progenitor transformation and represent an opportunity to identify epigenetic progress contributing to lineage leukemogenesis. Primary human and murine BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> leukemic progenitors have increased activation of Cdc42 and the downstream atypical protein kinase C (aPKC). While the isoform aPKCζ behaves as a leukemic suppressor, aPKCλ/ι is critically required for oncogenic progenitor proliferation, survival, and B-cell differentiation arrest, but not for normal B-cell lineage differentiation. In vitro and in vivo B-cell transformation by BCR-ABL requires the downregulation of key genes in the B-cell differentiation program through an aPKC λ/ι-Erk dependent Etv5/Satb2 chromatin repressive signaling complex. Genetic or pharmacological targeting of aPKC impairs human oncogenic addicted leukemias. Therefore, the aPKCλ/ι-SATB2 signaling cascade is required for leukemic BCR-ABL<sup>+</sup> B-cell progenitor transformation and is amenable to non-tyrosine kinase inhibition."
30610181,"Protein therapeutics represent a significant and growing component of the modern pharmacopeia, but their potential to treat human disease is limited because most proteins fail to traffic across biological membranes. Recently, we discovered a class of cell-permeant miniature proteins (CPMPs) containing a precisely defined, penta-arginine (penta-Arg) motif that traffics readily to the cytosol and nucleus of mammalian cells with efficiencies that rival those of hydrocarbon-stapled peptides active in animals and man. Like many cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs), CPMPs enter the endocytic pathway; the difference is that CPMPs containing a penta-Arg motif are released efficiently from endosomes, while other CPPs are not. Here, we seek to understand how CPMPs traffic from endosomes into the cytosol and what factors contribute to the efficiency of endosomal release. First, using two complementary cell-based assays, we exclude endosomal rupture as the primary means of endosomal escape. Next, using an RNA interference screen, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, and confocal imaging, we identify <i>VPS39</i>-a gene encoding a subunit of the homotypic fusion and protein-sorting (HOPS) complex-as a critical determinant in the trafficking of CPMPs and hydrocarbon-stapled peptides to the cytosol. Although CPMPs neither inhibit nor activate HOPS function, HOPS activity is essential to efficiently deliver CPMPs to the cytosol. CPMPs localize within the lumen of Rab7<sup>+</sup> and Lamp1<sup>+</sup> endosomes and their transport requires HOPS activity. Overall, our results identify Lamp1<sup>+</sup> late endosomes and lysosomes as portals for passing proteins into the cytosol and suggest that this environment is prerequisite for endosomal escape."
30609814,"Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are the foundation of modern stem cell-based regenerative medicine, especially in the case of degenerative disorders, such as muscular dystrophies (MDs). Since their introduction in 2006, many studies have used iPSCs for disease modeling and identification of involved mechanisms, drug screening, as well as gene correction studies. In the case of muscular dystrophies, these studies commenced in 2008 and continue to address important issues, such as defining the main pathologic mechanisms in different types of MDs, drug screening to improve skeletal/cardiac muscle cell survival and to slow down disease progression, and evaluation of the efficiency of different gene correction approaches, such as exon skipping, Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 (CRISPR/Cas9). In the current short review, we have summarized chronological progress of these studies and their key findings along with a perspective on the future road to successful iPSC-based cell therapy for MDs and the potential hurdles in this field."
30609663,"Autophagy is a highly conserved intracellular process for the ordered degradation and recycling of cellular components in lysosomes. In the liver, parenchymal cells (i.e., mainly hepatocytes) utilize autophagy to provide amino acids, glucose, and free fatty acids as sources of energy and biosynthesis functions, but also for recycling and controlling organelles such as mitochondria. Non-parenchymal cells of the liver, including endothelial cells, macrophages (Kupffer cells), and hepatic stellate cells (HSC), also employ autophagy, either for maintaining cellular homeostasis (macrophages, endothelium) or for providing energy for their activation (stellate cells). In hepatocytes, autophagy contributes to essential homeostatic functions (e.g., gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, fatty acid oxidation), but is also implicated in diseases. For instance, storage disorders (alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency, Wilson's disease), metabolic (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), and toxic (alcohol) liver diseases may benefit from augmenting autophagy in hepatocytes. In hepatic fibrosis, autophagy has been implicated in the fibrogenic activation of HSC to collagen-producing myofibroblasts. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), autophagy may contribute to tumor surveillance as well as invasiveness, indicating a dual and stage-dependent function in cancer. As many drugs directly or indirectly modulate autophagy, it is intriguing to investigate autophagy-targeting, possibly even cell type-directed strategies for the treatment of hereditary liver diseases, NASH, fibrosis, and HCC."
30609415,"Abstract&#13; Gene therapy with using of plasmid CRISPR (pCRISPR) reduces mistakes in gene editing and prevents of engendering integrational mutagenesis that have seen through available genome engineering technologies. Developing an ideal and traceable nanocarrier which can accurately and efficiently transfer this complex into the cytosol and facilitates the journey towards the nucleus is a fascinating area of research. Polyethylenimine (PEI) functionalized carbon dots (CD-PEI) were fabricated by one-step microwave assisted pyrolysis with average size around 3 nm. This CD-PEI was shown a good potential for intracellular delivery of genetic materials (∼70%). Also, this CD-PEI with passive surface modification with low molecular PEI (2 KDa) has a very high quantum yield as high as 40 percent with low cytotoxicity. The expression rate of the pCRISPR was around 15% in the HEK-293 cell which is comparable with the pristine PEI. Furthermore, the CD-PEI showed the good properties such as high quantum yield, biocompatibility and tunable emission wavelengths, suggesting the potential application of photoluminescent functionalized carbon dots as a suitable traceable nanocarrier for CRISPR delivery. &#13."
