30726976,pediatric,"Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNETs) are uncommon neural tumors presenting most often in children and young adults and associated with intractable seizures. Rare midline neoplasms with similar histological features to those found in DNETs have been described near the septum pellucidum and termed 'DNET-like neoplasms of the septum pellucidum'. Due to their rarity, these tumors have been described in just a few reports and their genetic alterations sought only in small series."
30726971,pediatric,"Craniopharyngioma constitutes one of the most challenging tumors. The surgery may be the definitive treatment and multiple approaches have been described based on different anatomical considerations. The choice of the right approach is the key to optimize the resection and minimize the risks. Besides, the presentation of this tumor in the pediatric population can carry additional challenges that are not present in adults, like the absence of pneumatization of the sphenoid bone for an endoscopic endonasal approach. In this video, we present a case of a 6-yr-old girl with a large sellar-suprasellar craniopharyngioma. The fact that the sphenoid was not pneumatized and the chiasm was elevated 1.2 cm from the planum sphenoidal were some of the reasons to choose a subfrontal infrachiasmatic approach as we discuss and we show in the video. This approach has not been very well established in the literature but we demonstrate it can become a good alternative for a particular type of sellar-suprasellar tumors. Appropriate video authorization consent was obtained from the parent of the patient."

30726926,pediatric,"Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a hematological disorder that can be due to genetic (primary HLH) causes or excessive activation of the immune system in association with infection, malignancy, rheumatologic disorders, or immune suppression (secondary HLH). Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis remains an under-recognized condition among neuropathologists, especially the secondary forms, where it may be diagnosed only at brain biopsy or autopsy due to confounding comorbidities. The CNS is frequently affected, but neuropathological features are underappreciated. We place our own experience with HLH in context with review of neuropathological features from the literature. A 10-year database search for cases from our pediatric and adult hospitals with re-review of neuropathological features revealed 1 biopsy and 5 autopsies. Literature that reported neuropathological features was tabulated and 8 adult and 12 pediatric cases were identified. Children had predominantly secondary HLH: 5/12 co-associated with Epstein Barr (or dual) viral infections, 3/12 with malignancy. One biopsy showed florid lymphohistiocytic infiltrates and hemophagocytosis and served as first diagnosis; 2/5 CNS autopsies had originally been reported as negative for HLH, but on re-review had subtle lymphohistiocytic infiltrates with hemophagocytosis confined to leptomeninges. In conclusion, the neuropathological features are highly variable in HLH; features such as focal erythrophagocytosis may be histologically subtle in early phases, but should be sought."

30726868,pediatric,"The disease risk score is a summary score that can be used to control for confounding with a potentially large set of covariates. While less widely used than the exposure propensity score, the disease risk score approach may be useful for novel or unusual exposures, when treatment indications or exposure patterns are rapidly changing, or when more is known about the nature of how covariates cause disease than is known about factors influencing propensity for the exposure of interest (sometimes called ""treatment""). Focusing on the simple case of a binary point exposure, we describe a marginal structural model for estimation of risk (or prevalence) ratios. The proposed model incorporates the disease risk score as an offset in a regression model, and yields an estimate of a standardized risk ratio where the target population is the exposed group. Simulations are used to illustrate the approach, and an empirical example is provided. Confounder control based on the proposed method may be a useful alternative to approaches based on the exposure propensity score, or as a complement to them."

We report the first pediatric patient with PDGFRB-rearranged myeloproliferative disorder associated with T-lymphoblastic lymphoma bearing the t(5; 14)(q33;q32) translocation who was successfully treated with imatinib only. Methods/Aims: Analysis of bone marrow and peripheral blood cells by fluorescent in situ hybridization identified the PDGFRB partner as CCDC88C. Whole genome sequencing of the patient's DNA identified the exact junction site, confirmed by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing.

30726804,pediatric,"Antenatal betamethasone (BMZ) is a standard therapy for reducing respiratory distress syndrome in preterm infants. Recently, some reports have indicated that BMZ promotes ductus arteriosus (DA) closure. DA closure requires morphological remodeling; that is, intimal thickening (IT) formation; however, the role of BMZ in IT formation has not yet been reported. Methods and Results: First, DNA microarray analysis using smooth muscle cells (SMCs) of rat preterm DA on gestational day 20 (pDASMCs) stimulated with BMZ was performed. Among 58,717 probe sets, ADP-ribosyltransferase 3 (Art3) was markedly increased by BMZ stimulation. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) confirmed the BMZ-induced increase of Art3 in pDASMCs, but not in aortic SMCs. Immunocytochemistry showed that BMZ stimulation increased lamellipodia formation. BMZ significantly increased total paxillin protein expression and the ratio of phosphorylated to total paxillin. A scratch assay demonstrated that BMZ stimulation promoted pDASMC migration, which was attenuated byArt3-targeted siRNAs transfection. pDASMC proliferation was not promoted by BMZ, which was analyzed by a 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) assay. Whether BMZ increased IT formation in vivo was examined. BMZ or saline was administered intravenously to maternal rats on gestational days 18 and 19, and DA tissues were obtained on gestational day 20. The ratio of IT to tunica media was significantly higher in the BMZ-treated group."
30726768,pediatric,"Drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy involves unpredictable seizures and long-term medical management. Both factors can alter a child's psychosocial development and the dynamics of the family, to the detriment of patient and family wellbeing. While drug-resistant pediatric epilepsy can be successfully treated by neurosurgery in some cases, the outlook for psychosocial and family functioning after surgery remains unclear. A total of 163 participants across four groups took part in the current study: these were (i) individuals who had undergone surgical treatment of drug-resistant focal seizures approximately five years prior as children, and were now largely adolescents or young adults ('Patients'; n = 23), (ii) their caregivers ('Patient Caregivers'; n = 27), (iii) healthy individuals of similar age and gender to the Patients ('Controls'; n = 53), and (iv) their caregivers ('Control Caregivers'; n = 60). Based on similar software validated in adults, we built an interactive computer program, 'Living with Epilepsy', to evaluate the achievement of age-specific developmental tasks in Patients relative to their peers. The Family Adaptability and Cohesion Scale measured family dynamics. The findings showed that in the context of seizure freedom, after pediatric epilepsy surgery, Patients are similar to their healthy peers in terms of attaining developmental tasks, with no differences between the Patient and Control groups (P > .05). Family dynamics, however, seemed resistant to postsurgical adaptation, with Patients reporting lower levels of balanced family dynamics (cohesion, flexibility) and higher rates of unbalanced family dynamics (disengagement, chaos, rigidity, enmeshment) relative to Patient Caregivers (P < .001-0.041), and the Controls (P = .011-0.034). Patients also reported reduced family satisfaction compared with that of Patient Caregivers (P = .002), which was associated with polytherapy prior to surgery; that is, more drug-resistant seizures. These findings suggested that childhood-onset epilepsy has a lasting effect on family functioning, even when the child has an optimal medical and psychosocial outcome. These initial findings have significant implications for the provision of pre- to postoperative family support in pediatric epilepsy cases."
30726742,pediatric,"β2-integrins promote neutrophil recruitment to infected tissues and are crucial for host defense. Neutrophil recruitment is defective in leukocyte adhesion deficiency type-1 (LAD1), a condition caused by mutations in the CD18 (β2-integrin) gene. Using a model of Citrobacter rodentium (CR)-induced colitis, we show that CD18<sup>-/-</sup> mice display increased intestinal damage and systemic bacterial burden, compared to littermate controls, ultimately succumbing to infection. This phenotype is not attributed to defective neutrophil recruitment, as it is shared by CXCR2<sup>-/-</sup> mice that survive CR infection. CR-infected CD18<sup>-/-</sup> mice feature prominent upregulation of IL-17 and downregulation of IL-22. Exogenous IL-22 administration, but not endogenous IL-17 neutralization, protects CD18<sup>-/-</sup> mice from lethal colitis. β2-integrin expression on macrophages is mechanistically linked to Rac1/ROS-mediated induction of noncanonical-NLRP3 (nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3) inflammasome-dependent IL-1β production, which promotes ILC3-derived IL-22. Therefore, β2-integrins are required for protective IL-1β-dependent IL-22 responses in colitis, and the identified mechanism may underlie the association of human LAD1 with colitis."
30726740,pediatric,"Spondweni virus (SPOV) is the flavivirus that is most closely related to Zika virus (ZIKV). Although SPOV causes sporadic human infections in Africa, recently it was found in Culex mosquitoes in Haiti. To investigate the pathogenic spectrum of SPOV, we developed infection models in mice. Although two SPOV strains failed to cause disease in immunocompetent mice, each accumulated in the brain, spleen, eye, testis, and kidney when type I interferon signaling was blocked and unexpectedly caused infection, immune cell infiltration, and swelling in the ankle. In pregnant mice, SPOV replicated in the placenta and fetus but did not cause placental insufficiency or microcephaly. We identified human antibodies from ZIKV or DENV immune subjects that neutralized SPOV infection and protected against lethal challenge. Our experiments describe similarities and differences in clinical syndromes between SPOV and ZIKV and suggest that their serological relatedness has implications for antibody therapeutics and flavivirus vaccine development."
30726738,pediatric,"Acyl CoA metabolites derived from the catabolism of carbon fuels can react with lysine residues of mitochondrial proteins, giving rise to a large family of post-translational modifications (PTMs). Mass spectrometry-based detection of thousands of acyl-PTMs scattered throughout the proteome has established a strong link between mitochondrial hyperacylation and cardiometabolic diseases; however, the functional consequences of these modifications remain uncertain. Here, we use a comprehensive respiratory diagnostics platform to evaluate three disparate models of mitochondrial hyperacylation in the mouse heart caused by genetic deletion of malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD), SIRT5 demalonylase and desuccinylase, or SIRT3 deacetylase. In each case, elevated acylation is accompanied by marginal respiratory phenotypes. Of the >60 mitochondrial energy fluxes evaluated, the only outcome consistently observed across models is a ∼15% decrease in ATP synthase activity. In sum, the findings suggest that the vast majority of mitochondrial acyl PTMs occur as stochastic events that minimally affect mitochondrial bioenergetics."
30726734,pediatric,"Spermatogenesis has been intensely studied in rodents but remains poorly understood in humans. Here, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to analyze human testes. Clustering analysis of neonatal testes reveals several cell subsets, including cell populations with characteristics of primordial germ cells (PGCs) and spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs). In adult testes, we identify four undifferentiated spermatogonia (SPG) clusters, each of which expresses specific marker genes. We identify protein markers for the most primitive SPG state, allowing us to purify this likely SSC-enriched cell subset. We map the timeline of male germ cell development from PGCs through fetal germ cells to differentiating adult SPG stages. We also define somatic cell subsets in both neonatal and adult testes and trace their developmental trajectories. Our data provide a blueprint of the developing human male germline and supporting somatic cells. The PGC-like and SSC markers are candidates to be used for SSC therapy to treat infertility."

30726717,pediatric,"The pathophysiology of spinal cord injury (SCI) related processes of axonal degeneration and demyelination are poorly understood. The present systematic review and meta-analysis were performed such to establish quantitative results of animal studies regarding the role of injury severity, SCI models and level of injury on the pathophysiology of axon and myelin sheath degeneration. 39 related articles were included in the analysis. The compiled data showed that the total number of axons, number of myelinated axons, myelin sheath thickness, axonal conduction velocity, and internode length steadily decreased as time elapsed from the injury (P<sub>for trend</sub><0.0001). The rate of axonal retrograde degeneration was affected by SCI model and severity of the injury. Axonal degeneration was higher in injuries of the thoracic region. The SCI model and the site of the injury also affected axonal retrograde degeneration. The number of myelinated axons in the caudal region of the injury was significantly higher than the lesion site and the rostral region. The findings of the present meta-analysis show that the pathophysiology of axons and myelin sheath differ in various phases of SCI and are affected by multiple factors related to the injury."
30726681,pediatric,"The need to educate and train future physicians about nutrition and wellness has become increasingly apparent in the past decade. A rising incidence of chronic health conditions with a nutrition background (e.g., obesity, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes) has led to an even greater need for nutrition educational content in medical school curricula so that physicians may counsel patients regarding their lifestyle factors. This review provides an overview of the successful development and integration of a nutrition thread in a 5-year medical school curriculum. Based on a survey conducted in our medical school program, students beginning medical school are lacking formal nutrition education, as only 8% arrived with some form of exposure. Despite this, nearly 85% of these medical students recognized that nutrition education is necessary in their training, and 70% state that the nutrition education they have received has influenced the way they care for patients. Key teaching points Physicians are faced with rising incidence of chronic health conditions that have a nutritional risk factor Physician self-care including optimal nutrition to support resilience is gaining importance. Nutrition education in medical schools is inadequate to address these rising needs. Implementing a comprehensive nutrition curricula that addresses personal wellness strategies, basic science concepts related to nutrition, and diagnosis and management of diseases that can be modified by or are related to nutrition as a topic thread that is woven throughout all years of the curriculum highlights the importance of nutrition in health and disease."

Although lysosomal storage disorders are diagnosed predominantly in children, many show variable expressivity with clinical presentations possible later in life. Given the important role of lysosomes in neuronal homeostasis, neurological manifestations, including movement disorders, can accompany many lysosomal storage disorders. Over the last decade, evidence from genetics, clinical epidemiology, cell biology, and biochemistry have converged to implicate links between lysosomal storage disorders and adult-onset movement disorders. The strongest evidence comes from mutations in Glucocerebrosidase, which cause Gaucher's disease and are among the most common and potent risk factors for PD. However, recently, many additional lysosomal storage disorder genes have been similarly implicated, including SMPD1, ATP13A2, GALC, and others. Examination of these links can offer insight into pathogenesis of PD and guide development of new therapeutic strategies.

In a population affected by ASD we aimed to evaluate: the phenotypic characteristics; the prevalence of EEG abnormalities; the potential correlations between EEG abnormalities and behavioral and cognitive variables. Sixty-nine patients with ASD underwent cognitive or developmental testing, language assessment, and adaptive behavior skills evaluation as well as sleep/wake EEG recording. EEG abnormalities were found in 39.13% of patients. EEG abnormalities correlated with autism severity, hyperactivity, anger outbursts, aggression, negative or destructive behavior, motor stereotypies, intellectual disability, language impairment and self-harm. Our findings confirmed that EEG abnormalities are present in the ASD population and correlate with several associated phenotypic features."

30726247,pediatric,"Access to therapeutic oxygen remains a challenge in the effort to reduce pneumonia mortality among children in low- and middle-income countries. The use of oxygen concentrators is common, but their effectiveness in delivering uninterrupted oxygen is gated by reliability of the power grid. Often cylinders are employed to provide continuous coverage, but these can present other logistical challenges. In this study, we examined the use of a novel, low-pressure oxygen storage system to capture excess oxygen from a concentrator to be delivered to patients during an outage. A prototype was built and tested in a non-clinical trial in Jinja, Uganda. The trial was carried out at Jinja Regional Referral Hospital over a 75-day period. The flow rate of the unit was adjusted once per week between 0.5 and 5 liters per minute. Over the trial period, 1284 power failure episodes with a mean duration of 3.1 minutes (range 0.08 to 1720 minutes) were recorded. The low-pressure system was able to deliver oxygen over 56% of the 4,295 power outage minutes and cover over 99% of power outage events over the course of the study. These results demonstrate the technical feasibility of a method to extend oxygen availability and provide a basis for clinical trials."

Empirically-based recommendations for addressing pediatric obesity include intensive interdisciplinary weight management comprising medical, behavioral health, nutrition, and exercise components. The present study examined changes in psychosocial functioning associated with frequency of participation in an interdisciplinary pediatric weight management program. Participants were 86 patients (55.8% females; median age = 11.5 years; 67.4% Non-Hispanic Black; median BMI percentile = 99.5) enrolled in an interdisciplinary pediatric weight management program for at least one year. Psychosocial functioning was measured with the Pediatric Symptom Checklist (PSC-17), a caregiver-completed mental health screen that assesses internalizing, externalizing, and attention difficulties as well as global functioning. The PSC-17 was completed at the initial clinic visit (baseline) and repeated one-year later (annual). The Wilcoxon Signed Rank test indicated that annual PSC-17 scores were significantly lower than baseline scores across all domains. Spearman correlation coefficients revealed no significant association between total number of clinic visits and PSC-17 global or subscale scores. However, the number of visits for exercise-only sessions was significantly correlated with caregiver-reported improvement in internalizing behaviors. Findings suggest that participation in interdisciplinary pediatric weight management may improve psychosocial functioning in youth with obesity and that attending supervised exercise sessions may be especially beneficial for improving internalizing behavior symptoms."
30726113,pediatric,"Accumulating evidence has highlighting the potential of microRNAs (miRs) as biomarkers in various human diseases. However, the roles of miRs in bacterial meningitis (BM), a severe infectious condition, still remain unclear. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of miR-135a on proliferation and apoptosis of astrocytes in BM. Neonatal rats were injected with streptococcus pneumoniae to establish the BM model. The expression of miR-135a and HIF-1α in the BM rat models were characterized, followed by determination of their interaction. Using gain- and loss-of function approaches, the effects of miR-135a on proliferation, apoptosis and expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), in addition to the apoptosis-related factors in astrocytes were examined accordingly. The regulatory effect of HIF-1α was also determined along with the overexpression or knockdown of HIF-1α. The results obtained indicated that miR-135a was poorly expressed while HIF-1α was highly expressed in the BM rat models. In addition, restored expression levels of miR-135a were determined to promote proliferation while inhibiting the apoptosis of astrocytes, along with downregulated Bax and Bad, as well as upregulated Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and GFAP. As a target gene of miR-135a, HIF-1α expression was determined to be diminished by miR-135a. The upregulation of HIF-1α reversed the miR-135a-induced proliferation of astrocytes. Taken together, the key findings of the current study present evidence suggesting that miR-135a can downregulate HIF-1α and play a contributory role in the development of astrocytes derived from BM, providing a novel theoretical perspective for BM treatment approaches."

Here we introduce a modified commercially available catalytic combustion/reduction methanizer to quantitatively convert organics to CO<sub>2</sub> for δ<sup>13</sup>C analysis while retaining chromatographic resolution. These modified ""ARC"" reactors operate with a transition-metal catalyst that requires a flowing O<sub>2</sub> gas to enable complete conversion to CO<sub>2</sub> at lower temperature (620 °C) with acceptable reactor life, reduced complexity, and improved robustness. Performance of two versions of the ARC reactors with different combustion volumes was characterized by analysis of steroid and alkane isotopic standard materials. Linearity of steroid isotopic standards ranged from 0.02 to 0.60 ‰/V in the range of 25 to 200 ng of each steroid injected. Precisions and accuracies of measurements for steroids and alkanes had average standard deviations of SD(δ<sup>13</sup>C) less than ±0.18 ‰ and average accuracy of better than 0.19 ‰ δ<sup>13</sup>C<sub>VPDB</sub>.

30725480,pediatric,"Benign breast disease(BBD) is an established breast cancer(BC) risk factor, but it is unclear whether the magnitude of the association applies to women at familial or genetic risk. This information is needed to improve BC risk assessment in clinical settings. Using the Prospective Family Study Cohort (ProF-SC), we used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate hazard ratios(HRs) and 95% confidence intervals(CIs) for the association of BBD with BC risk. We also examined whether the association with BBD differed by underlying familial risk profile(FRP), calculated using absolute risk estimates from the BOADICEA model. During 176,756 person-years of follow-up (median: 10.9 years, maximum: 23.7) of 17,154 women unaffected with BC at baseline, we observed 968 incident cases of BC. A total of 4,704 (27%) women reported a history of BBD diagnosis. A history of BBD was associated with a greater risk of BC: HR = 1.31(95% CI: 1.14 - 1.50), and did not differ by underlying FRP, with HRs of 1.35(95% CI: 1.11-1.65), 1.26(95% CI: 1.00-1.60), and 1.40(95% CI: 1.01-1.93), for categories of full lifetime BOADICEA score <20%, 20% - <35%, ≥ 35%, respectively. There was no difference in the association for women with BRCA1 mutations (HR: 1.64; 95% CI: 1.04-2.58), women with BRCA2 mutations (HR: 1.34; 95% CI: 0.78-2.3) or for women without a known BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation (HR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.13-1.53) (p<sub>interaction</sub> = 0.95).

30725405,pediatric,"Cancer cells have an elevated methionine (MET) requirement compared to normal cells and are termed MET dependent. Cancer cells were isolated in MET-restricted (MR) medium that reverted from MET dependence to MET independence. Increased MET biosynthesis was not a prerequisite for reversion to MET independence, indicating that MET dependence was not due to reduced endogenous MET synthesis. MET-independent revertants of cancer cells concomitantly reverted for some of the other properties associated with malignancy: Of the 13 MET-independent revertants isolated 5 showed increased anchorage dependence as reflected by reduced cloning efficiencies in methylcellulose; 8 showed an increased serum requirement for optimal growth; 8 showed decreased cell density in medium containing high serum; and 3 altered their cell morphology significantly. Eight of the 13 revertants have increased chromosome numbers. Thus, by selecting for MET independence, it is possible to obtain heterogeneous reduced-malignancy revertants, indicating further a relationship between altered MET metabolism and other fundamental properties of oncogenic transformation."
30725404,pediatric,"Many different types of cancer cells have been shown to be methionine (MET) dependent. Cancer cells, unlike normal cells, grow poorly or not at all when MET is restricted. Cancer cells have an elevated requirement for exogenous MET for growth, despite high levels of endogenous synthesis. This requirement reflects increased utilization of MET by cancer cells, analogous to increased utilization glucose by cancer cells (Warburg effect). To answer the critical question of whether MET-dependent cancer cells synthesize normal amounts of MET, we determined the levels of MET, S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMET), and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHCY) that were synthesized by MET-dependent cancer cells under conditions of MET restriction. We demonstrated that MET-dependent cells synthesize a normal amount of endogenously synthesized MET but are still deficient in AdoMET. In contrast, exogenously supplied MET results in normal AdoMET levels. The ratio of AdoMET to AdoHCY is low in MET-dependent cells growing in MET-restricted medium but is normal when MET is supplied. Under conditions of MET restriction, the low AdoMET/AdoHCY ratio probably limits proliferation of MET-dependent cancer cells. The amount of free MET is also low in MET-dependent cancer cells under MET restriction. The elevated MET requirement for cancer cells may be due to enhanced overall rates of transmethylation compared to normal human cells. Thus, MET-dependent cancer cells have low levels of free MET, low levels of AdoMET, and elevated levels of AdoHCY under conditions of MET restriction probably due to overuse of MET for transmethylation reactions (""Hoffman effect""), thereby blocking cellular proliferation."

We explored Spanish-speaking caregivers' perceptions, understandings, and barriers with the care they received for asthma, after exposure to an ED asthma-care bundle. This qualitative study was part of a larger QI initiative on Spanish-speaking caregivers of patients presenting to a children's hospital ED with an asthma exacerbation. Patients were exposed to an asthma-care bundle, which included timely administration of medication, home dose of medications, an educational intervention, asthma action plans (AAPs), and discharge instructions. Through semi-structured interviews and qualitative analyses, we assessed the perceptions, understandings, and barriers caregivers reported during their ED experience. From January 2015 to October 2016, 492 patients received AAPs in the ED. Of 128 families that preferred Spanish, 88 (69%) received a Spanish AAP, 41 (32%) received Spanish discharge instructions, and 34 (27%) received discharge materials in both languages. Thirteen families were interviewed. Three themes emerged regarding the caregivers' perceived barriers: (1) need for improved accessibility to medication, primary care, and insurance; (2) communication barriers, such as timeliness, availability of interpreters, and need for resources in their preferred language; and (3) uncertainty about the child's diagnosis and acuity. Incorporating the caregivers' perspectives into QI projects may yield valuable information when developing new interventions. In the ED, improving accessibility to interpreters and providing discharge materials in their preferred language, as well as addressing misconceptions about asthma, may enhance caregivers' satisfaction."

30724883,pediatric,"One of new methods for the physiotherapeutic treatment in pediatrics is the application of the pulsed low-frequency electrostatic field the action of which is based on the effects of deep resonant vibration on the affected tissue region with the minimal mecha-nical impact. Under the influence of the electrostatic field, the tissues at the site of interest become tightened and descend which causes their vibration due to the alternation of the pulses and intervals between them. The fast consecutive repetition of this process results in rhythmical deformation of the tissues. The electrostatic pulses are responsible for the increased friction between separate parts of the tissues while in the intervals between the pulses the tissue elastically resists their influence. In this way, the tissues subjected to such influence 'are pumped over' throughout their depth. It leads to the restoration of elasticity and mobilization of separate fibers and layers inside the tissue as well as to the development and improvement of the blood flow in the tissues and their blood supply. During the recent years, a large number of reports have been published in the literature concerning the possibilities of application of the pulsed low-frequency electrostatic field for the treatment and prevention of various di-seases in the children, including both monotherapy and its combination with other therapeutic modalities. The favourable action of the pulse low-frequency electrostatic field on the clinical course of bronchial asthma, mucoviscidosis, I and II degree scoliosis in the young children, remittent multiple sclerosis in the adolescents has been demonstrated. The data obtained give evidence of the high effectiveness of the proposed method, its excellent tolerance, and a wide range of beneficial effects on the main pathogenetic components of the diseases which creates the good prerequisites for the further active introduction of the therapeutic phy-sical factors in the practical work of the children's medical organizations."
30724864,pediatric,"The local shear wave speed (in meters per second) and Young modulus (in kilopascals) of normal thyroid glands were defined in healthy children to determine reference values.This prospective study assessed 107 pediatric cases (age interval, 3-17 years; mean, 9.37 ± 3.68 years), including 52 boys and 55 girls. The study group included children without thyroid gland disease (autoimmune, infectious, or neoplastic). Data about the sex, age, weight, height, and body mass index (BMI) of the subjects were recorded for all subjects. Elasticity values were measured from 3 different sites in both thyroid lobes and averaged.Median values for elasticity and shear wave velocity measured in bilateral thyroid lobes were 6.38 ± 1.97 kPa (range, 3.00-12.5 kPa) and 1.45 ± 0.21 m/s (range, 1.03-2.04 m/s) on the right and 8.81 ± 3.00 kPa (range, 3.80-22.6 kPa) and 1.69 ± 0.26 m/s (range, 1.13-2.68 m/s) on the left. There was no significant difference between the elasticity values for the right and left thyroid lobes between boys and girls. There was a positive correlation between right thyroid lobe mean elasticity (in kilopascals) and shear wave velocity (in meters per second) values with age, BMI, and right thyroid lobe volume in the whole group. No significant correlation was found between left thyroid lobe mean elasticity (in kilopascals) and shear wave velocity (in meters per second) values with age, BMI, and left thyroid lobe volume in the study population.This study determined mean elasticity and shear wave velocity values for thyroid gland in healthy children.

The epithelium plays a critical role as a highly dynamic, selective semipermeable barrier that separates luminal contents and pathogens from the rest of the body as well as controlling the absorption of nutrients, fluid and solutes (1, 2). A series of protein complexes including the adherens junction, desmosomes, and tight junctions (TJ) function as the principal barrier in paracellular diffusion (3) as well as regulators of intracellular solute, protein and lipid transport (4). TJs are composed of a series of proteins called occludins, junctional adhesion molecules (JAM), and claudins (5, 6) that reside primarily as the most apical intercellular junction. Here we will review one of these protein families, claudins, and their relevance to gastrointestinal and liver diseases."
30724790,pediatric,"Back pain in children is a complex phenomenon, which has been shown to be associated with physical and psychosocial factors. None of the studies on Indian children have investigated the possible association between back pain and psychosocial factors. We decided to determine the prevalence of back pain in students and association with both physical and psychosocial factors. A cross-sectional study was conducted on 163 students from two city schools. Physical factors were evaluated using a structured questionnaire. Strengths and difficulties questionnaire was used to assess psychosocial factors. The studied sample consisted of 49.7% boys and 50.3% girls. Mean school bag weight was 6.1±2.4 kg (range: 2.2-15.6 kg). Mean weight of school bag as a percentage of body weight was 13.5±6.2%. Approximately 76% students carried more than 10% of their body weight. The prevalence of back pain (over last 1 month) was 53.9%. No associations were found between back pain and weight of school bag, weight of school bag as a percentage of body weight and physical activities. Significant associations were found between back pain and number of hours spent watching television [odds ratio (OR): 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.5-7.5; P=0.003], history of injury to the back (OR: 4.8, 95% CI: 1.47-15.8, P=0.003), presence of a family member complaining of back pain (OR: 1.98, 95% CI: 1.25-3.14, P=0.002), conduct (P=0.042) and hyperactivity problems (P=0.045). Thus, there appears a need to consider psychosocial factors along with physical factors when evaluating a young student with back pain."

30724783,pediatric,"We performed side-by-side experiments to compare the behavior of four strains of Escherichia coli and one strain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in fresh human and mouse blood. Bacteria multiplied in mouse whole blood and plasma but were killed in human whole blood and plasma. The percentage of granulocytes associated with fluorescence-labeled heat-killed E. coli relative to total leukocytes counted was higher in human compared to mouse blood as assessed by flow cytometry analysis. Concentrations of proinflammatory cytokines were high in human blood, but undetectable in mouse blood despite high concentrations of bacteria. We conclude that bacterial killing, phagocytosis and cytokine induction in blood during human bacteremia with these organisms are probably not mimicked in mouse models of bacterial challenge. Understanding the mechanisms for low cytokine induction with high bacterial loads in mouse blood may be helpful to interpret murine models of bacteremia and develop new approaches for treating sepsis in humans."

Development of effective new therapeutics for NB is in progress to help reduce mortality and morbidity of the disease, particularly in relapsed patients. The tumor suppressor protein p53 plays a critical role in multiple signaling pathways to maintain cellular hemostasis. Dysregulation of p53 protein and/or molecular aberrations have been associated with multiple human malignancies. p53 stability and protein activity is negatively regulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase (MDM2). Thus, targeting p53-MDM2 protein-protein interaction is a feasible and promising therapeutic strategy to restore the physiological function of p53 in cancer cells. RG7112 is a highly potent and selective small molecule inhibitor, which target a unique structure located within p53 binding motif of MDM2."

30724444,pediatric,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis syndrome that leads to coronary artery aneurysm (CAA). While echocardiography is the most important imaging modality for coronary artery assessment, a specific diagnostic biomarker complementary for CAA has not been reported. We aimed to analyze the profiles of exosomal miRNAs extracted from the serum of KD patients and controls to identify candidate biomarkers for CAA. Serum samples from 39 healthy children, 42 CAA patients, 38 coronary artery dilatation (CAD) patients and 45 virus-infected patients including 24 EBV patients and 21 ADV patients were randomly selected. Next generation sequencing was used to analyze serum exosomal miRNA to detect differentially expressed miRNAs. Biomarker candidates were validated by qRT-PCR. One hundred (and) ninety-six differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were detected in CAA patients and healthy children. There were 70 DEMs and 140 DEMs in CAA patients versus CAD patients, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, respectively. We selected the three most upregulated (let-7i-3p, miR-17-3p, and miR-210-5p) and the three most downregulated miRNAs (miR-6743-5p, miR-1246, and miR-6834-5p) in the DEMs, which were expressed differentially in CAA patients versus healthy children, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, not in virus-infected patients versus healthy children, as biomarker candidates. Excluded DEMs of CAD and virus-infected patients, let-7i-3p was detected by sequence data analysis as a biomarker candidate for CAA patients, and then validated by qRT-PCR in a larger set of clinical samples. As a biomarker candidate, let-7i-3p provides an additional means of diagnosing CAA patients. Additionally, miRNA biomarkers complement ultrasonic imaging, allowing for greater diagnostic precision. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019."

In adults, pathogenic antibodies that target the extracellular domains of leucine-rich glioma-inactivated protein 1 (LGI1) and contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2) have been reported. We describe three paediatric patients with acquired neuromyotonia and CASPR2 and LGI1 serum antibodies. They all presented with acute-onset myokymia and pain in the lower limbs; one patient also had muscle weakness. Electromyography was suggestive of peripheral nerve hyperexcitability. Two patients improved without immunotherapy; one treated patient remained immunotherapy-dependent. Although not fatal, acquired paediatric neuromyotonia can be disabling. It is amenable to symptomatic treatment or may undergo spontaneous recovery. More severe cases may require rational immunotherapy. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The symptoms of neuromyotonia may resolve spontaneously or may require sodium channel blockers. Patients with debilitating symptoms who are refractory to symptomatic therapy may require immunotherapy."
30724342,pediatric,"Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a cancer predisposition syndrome with an incidence of 1:2000. Patients with NF1 have an increased cancer risk and mortality, but there are no population-based cohort studies specifically investigating the risk of childhood malignancies. We used the Finnish NF1 cohort to analyze the incidence, risk and prognosis of malignancies in NF1 patients <20 years of age. Persons born in 1987-2011 were included, and 524 persons were followed through the files of the Finnish Cancer Registry from birth up to age 20 years. This amounted to 8,376 person years. Fifty-three patients had cancer <20 years of age, yielding a standardized incidence ratio (SIR) of 35.6. The most frequent location of pediatric cancers was the central nervous system (CNS); there were 45 cases and the SIR was 115.7. Exclusion of 22 optic pathway gliomas (OPGs) gave an SIR of 59.1 for the CNS and 21.6 for all cancers. There were nine malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs); their cumulative risk was 2.7% by age 20. No cases of leukemia were observed. NF1 patients showed considerable excess mortality with a standardized mortality ratio (SMR) of 73.1. The survival of NF1 patients with CNS tumors other than OPGs did not differ from that of non-NF1 controls (HR 0.64, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.76). In conclusion, brain tumors in childhood and MPNSTs in adolescence are malignancies of major concern in patients with NF1. The risk for myeloid malignancies may not be as high as suggested in the literature. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
