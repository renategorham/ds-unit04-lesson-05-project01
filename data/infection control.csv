Copper has been reported to possess bacteriocidal effects, and the introduction of copper-impregnated products is receiving attention as a potential component of hospital infection control. In this study, copper-impregnated door handles as highly touched areas were introduced in a hematology ward, and their bacteriocidal effects were evaluated in comparison with conventional products. All 12 samples obtained from conventional door handles were positive for bacterial cultures, whereas only 5 of 18 samples from copper-impregnated handles were positive (P<0.0001). The mean number of bacterial colonies per milliliter of sample was 300 (range: 40-1.1×10<sup>6</sup>) in samples from conventional handles, but it was significantly lower in samples from copper-impregnated handles (0; range: 0-220, P<0.0001). While various types of bacteria grew on conventional handles, most of the bacteria on copper-impregnated handles were Bacillus subtilis. These results suggest that the introduction of copper-impregnated products would be useful for hospital infection control by reducing the bacterial burden on highly touched areas. However, the efficacy of this approach against spore-forming bacteria should be further investigated."
30726798,infection control,"End-stage liver disease (ESLD) is among leading causes of death for people living with HIV and HCV. Little is known how liver fibrosis score predicts mortality in HIV/HCV co-infected population under combination antiretroviral therapy (cART). A retrospective cohort study of 691 HIV/HCV co-infected patients receiving cART in Yunnan, China from 2005 to 2016 was carried out to explore the association between Fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and all-cause mortality. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) for FIB-4 and covariates. After a median follow-up of 4.8 years with a total follow-up time of 3,696 person-years (PY), 131 deaths occurred and the all-cause mortality was 3.5 per 100 PY. The mortality was 2.9 (95% CI: 2.3-3.5)/100 PY for the FIB-4 ≤ 3.25 group and 5.8 (4.2-7.4)/100 PY for the FIB-4 > 3.25 group at baseline. People with FIB-4 changed from mild to advanced group showed HR of 1.81 (95% CI: 1.01-3.25) for death, and with FIB-4 sustaining advanced showed HR of 3.11 (1.75-5.54), both compared to those with FIB-4 remained mild, while lower risk of death was observed among married people (HR = 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.99) compared to unmarried, among those with most recent CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell counts between 200 and 350 cells/μL (0.50, 0.30-0.86) and > 350 cells/μL (0.25, 0.15-0.41) compared to CD4 under 200 cells/μL. Advanced and progressive liver fibrosis is a strong predictor of all-cause mortality in HIV/HCV co-infected patients under cART in China."

When this disease appears, little symptomatology is observed, which causes prolonged periods of disease associated to delayed diagnosis and a poor answer to the antiparasitic therapy. The central mountain range of Peru is the geographical zone with the greatest prevalence, presumably due to the inadequate measures of environmental sanitation, the lack of education and the almost non-existent control measures of the disease. With the aim to discuss the problems related to the subcutaneous location and its probable physiopathology, this study reports two cases of subcutaneous hydatidosis that appeared with tumor lesions with a prolonged evolution and that did not affect the liver or the lungs and which were finally treated by means of surgical removal due to the lack of response to treatment with albendazol."

30726291,infection control,"CD8 T cells are necessary for the elimination of intracellular pathogens, but during chronic viral infections, CD8 T cells become exhausted and unable to control the persistent infection. Programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade therapies have been shown to improve CD8 T cell responses during chronic viral infections. These therapies have been licensed to treat cancers in humans, but they have not yet been licensed to treat chronic viral infections because limited benefit is seen in pre-clinical animal models of chronic infection. In the present study, we investigated whether TLR4 triggering could improve PD-1 therapy during a chronic viral infection. Using the model of chronic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) infection in mice, we show that TLR4 triggering with sublethal doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) followed by PD-1 blockade results in superior improvement in circulating virus-specific CD8 T cell responses, relative to PD-1 blockade alone. Moreover, we show that the synergy between LPS and PD-1 blockade is dependent on B7 costimulation and mediated by a dendritic cell (DC) intrinsic mechanism. Systemic LPS administration may have safety concerns, motivating us to devise a safer regimen. We show that ex vivo activation of DCs with LPS, followed by adoptive DC transfer, results in a similar potentiation of PD-1 therapy without inducing wasting disease. In summary, our data demonstrate a previously unidentified role for LPS/TLR4 signaling in modulating the host response to PD-1 therapy. These findings may be important for developing novel checkpoint therapies against chronic viral infection."
30726120,infection control,"Severe asthma affects a small proportion of asthma patients (~ 3-5%) and reflects a failure of conventional asthma medications to provide adequate control. Severe asthma is a disease of significant clinical heterogeneity, likely caused by different pathobiological mechanisms, frequently referred to as endotypes. In the last decade, multiple monoclonal therapies have been developed to target airway type-2 eosinophilic and/or allergic severe asthma. However, the underlying mechanisms of both type 2 immunity and eosinophilia (blood and airway) remain incompletely understood and offer a potential for novel therapies that target eosinophil maturation in the bone marrow and specific kinases expressed in type 2 cells, such as JAK-STAT inhibitors. Furthermore, some patients do not consistently demonstrate a type 2 disease clinical profile and display other inflammatory phenotypes at a given point in time. Targeting airway smooth muscle dysfunction, airway mucous, type-17 immunity and airway dysbiosis, may represent novel therapeutic approaches for severe asthma in the future. Unfortunately, the biomarkers for these subtypes of severe asthma are underdeveloped, rendering it difficult to conduct effective clinical trials. There are also barriers regarding the efficiency of standard clinical trials. Moving beyond these barriers will require innovation in trial design, effective partnerships with patient groups and effective multi-national trials consortia. There are current transatlantic opportunities to conduct clinical trials that could facilitate the development of common trial platforms to maximize overall efficiency and move the field of severe asthma forward."
30725416,infection control,"Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) derived from Pseudomonas putida targets the elevated methionine (MET) requirement of cancer cells (methionine dependence) and has shown efficacy against a variety of cancer types in mouse models. To enhance the efficacy of rMETase, we constructed the pLGFP-METSN retrovirus encoding the P. putida methioninase (METase) gene fused with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene. pLGFP-METSN or control vector pLGFPSN was introduced into the human lung cancer cell line H460. The retrovirus-mediated METase gene transfer decreased the intracellular MET level of the cancer cells and consequently enhanced the efficacy of treatment with the rMETase protein. The rMETase gene was introduced into an adenovirus. rAd-METase transduction of human OVACAR-8 ovarian cancer cells and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells in vitro and in vivo resulted in high levels of METase expression up to 10% or more of the total protein of the cells, depending on the multiplicity of infection. The combination of rAd-METase and rMETase was synergistic to kill these cells. Normal fibroblasts, on the other hand, appeared relatively resistant to the METase gene in the presence of rMETase. Adenoviral METase-transduced cancer cells were used in combination with selenomethionine, releasing highly toxic methylselenol, which killed both the cancer cells containing the METase gene and bystanders. Methylselenol damaged the mitochondria via oxidative stress and caused cytochrome c release into the cytosol, thereby activating the caspase cascade and cancer-cell apoptosis. Adenoviral METase-gene/SeMET treatment also inhibited tumor growth in rodents and significantly prolonged their survival. AdMETase/SeMET therapy was effective against Bcl-2-overproducing A549 lung cancer cells, which were resistant to staurosporine-induced apoptosis, with a strong bystander effect. The combination of Ad-METase/SeMET and doxorubicin (DOX) delayed the growth of the H460 human lung cancer, growing subcutaneously in nude mice. These results demonstrate the potential of methionine restriction (MR) for cancer treatment."

We retrospectively collected 64 haplo-HSCT patients in our hospital from 2013 to 2014, as well as 38 HLA-matched-HSCT patients during the same period as the control group. We analyzed B7H1, B7H3, PD1, soluble CD25, ST2 and TNFR1 at 0 day, + 7 days, + 14 days and + 28 days after HSCT. The + 7 days/+ 14 days B7H1/B7H3 and + 28 days ST2 serum levels were higher in patients with aGVHD who underwent haplo-HSCT. Moreover, + 7 days B7H1/B7H3 serum levels were predictive of grade III-IV aGVHD (B7H1: AUC = 0.830, P < 0.001; B7H3: AUC = 0.775, P = 0.001). Haplo-HSCT patients with higher + 7 days B7H1/B7H3 or + 28 days ST2 serum levels had poor GVHD-related mortality (GRM) (B7H1: P < 0.001; B7H3: P = 0.002; ST2: P = 0.047). Multivariate analysis revealed that the + 7 days B7H1 serum level (P = 0.041), as well as viral infection (P = 0.015) and donor age (P = 0.012), could independently predict GRM. Collectively, we found that + 7 days B7H1/B7H3 serum levels can predict grade III-IV aGVHD, while only the + 7 days B7H1 serum level, together with viral infection and donor age, could independently predict GRM in patients with haplo-HSCT."

We reviewed recent literature on perinatal HIV in the United States. Among perinatally HIV-exposed infants (whose mothers have HIV, without regard to infants' HIV diagnosis), prenatal and natal antiretroviral use has increased, maternal HIV infection is more frequently diagnosed prior to pregnancy, and breastfeeding is uncommon. In contrast, mothers of infants with HIV are tested at a lower rate for HIV, receive prenatal care less often, receive antiretrovirals (prenatal and natal) less often, and breastfeed more often. The incidence of perinatal HIV remains 5 times as high among black than white infants. The annual number of births to women with HIV was estimated last for 2006 (8,700), but has likely decreased. The numbers of women of childbearing age living with HIV and HIV diagnoses have decreased.

30724784,infection control,"Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes control sepsis by migration to the site of infection via their chemokine receptors. CCR5 is a chemokine receptor that is not expressed on neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes under homeostatic conditions. However, it has been demonstrated that CCR5 can become expressed on these cells during different models of inflammation. In the present study, we investigated if CCR5 is also expressed on neutrophil and inflammatory monocytes during sepsis, exerting an important role in the migration of these cells to the infectious focus. Using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) model to induce polymicrobial sepsis, we demonstrated that the expression of CCR5 is induced on CD11bLy6GLy6C inflammatory monocytes, but not on neutrophils (CD11bLy6GLy6C). Furthermore, CCR5 plays an important role for the migration of the inflammatory monocytes to infection focus during sepsis. CCR5-expressing inflammatory monocytes migrate from the bone marrow to the circulation and then into the site of infection, where they phagocytize and kill the bacteria. Consequently, CCR5 mice showed increased systemic inflammatory response and mortality compared to wild-type mice. These data therefore demonstrate a hitherto unrecognized protective role of CCR5 in sepsis."

An open-label, randomized, phase I/II clinical study was conducted in 100 healthy Japanese children equally randomized to a JVC-001 group and an MR with monovalent mumps vaccine (Hoshino strain) group. Immunogenicity was assessed using a neutralization test (NT) for measles, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test for rubella, and NT and enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) for mumps strain with different genotypes (genotype A, B, D and G) on Day 0 and Day 42-56. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) were recorded. Seroconversion rates of measles and rubella were both 100%. JVC-001 induced higher immunogenicity against mumps virus genotype G with seroconversion rate of 77.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.7-88.0%) compared to 65.3% (95% CI: 50.4-78.3%) in the control group. Geometric mean titer (GMT) was 12.5 (95% CI: 8.6-18.3) in the JVC-001 group and 7.1 (95% CI: 5.0-10.1) in the control group.

Although IL-12 can enhance cancer immunity, a strategy of safe IL-12 delivery without toxicity is currently lacking. We engineered T cells to express IL-12 controlled by the NFAT promoter responsive to TCR stimulation, or by the Tet-On promoter responsive to doxycycline. <i>In vivo</i>, NFAT-engineered T cells caused lethal toxicity, while Tet-engineered T cells were safe in the absence of doxycycline. Combining gene transfer of the melanoma-specific TRP2-TCR with Tet-IL-12 engineering revealed that temporal induction of IL-12 was essential to inhibit the growth of B16F10 melanoma tumors. Induced IL-12 increased the number of tumor-infiltrating T cells and also prevented the down-modulation of the TRP2-TCR and the associated up-regulation of the PD1 marker that was observed in the absence of IL-12. In addition, temporal induction of IL-12 expression also increased the number of plasmacytoid DC in the tumor micro-environment. We show that repeated induction of IL-12 can be used to enhance control of tumor growth without encountering systemic toxicity. The observation that TCR engineering combined with Tet-regulated IL-12 expression can achieve tumor immunity without the side effects that are usually associated with the <i>in vivo</i> use of IL-12 warrants translation of this concept into the clinic."

However, what shapes microbiota composition is not clear, in particular the role of genetic factors. Previous work in Caenorhabditis elegans defined a characteristic worm gut microbiota significantly influenced by host genetics. The current work explores the role of central regulators of host immunity and stress resistance, employing qPCR and CFU counts to measure abundance of core microbiota taxa in mutants raised on synthetic communities of previously-isolated worm gut commensals. This revealed a bloom, specifically of Enterobacter species, in immune-compromised TGFβ/BMP mutants. Imaging of fluorescently labeled Enterobacter showed that TGFβ/BMP-exerted control operated primarily in the anterior gut and depended on multi-tissue contributions. Enterobacter commensals are common in the worm gut, contributing to infection resistance. However, disruption of TGFβ/BMP signaling turned a normally beneficial Enterobacter commensal to pathogenic.

Critically, we demonstrate that engineered <i>Ae. aegypti</i> mosquitoes harboring the anti-ZIKV transgene have significantly reduced viral infection, dissemination, and transmission rates of ZIKV. Taken together, these compelling results provide a promising path forward for development of effective genetic-based ZIKV control strategies, which could potentially be extended to curtail other arboviruses."
30723131,infection control,"Mucormycosis is an emerging fungal infection that is often lethal due to the ineffectiveness of current therapies. Here, we have studied the first stage of this infection-the germination of <i>Mucor circinelloides</i> spores inside phagocytic cells-from an integrated transcriptomic and functional perspective. A relevant fungal gene network is remodeled in response to phagocytosis, being enriched in crucial functions to survive and germinate inside the phagosome, such as nutritional adaptation and response to oxidative stress. Correspondingly, the phagocytic cells induced a specific proinflammatory and apoptotic response to the pathogenic strain. Deletion of fungal genes encoding putative transcription factors (<i>atf1</i>, <i>atf2</i>, and <i>gcn4</i>), extracellular proteins (<i>chi1</i> and <i>pps1</i>), and an aquaporin (<i>aqp1</i>) revealed that these genes perform important roles in survival following phagocytosis, germination inside the phagosome, and virulence in mice. <i>atf1</i> and <i>atf2</i> play a major role in these pathogenic processes, since their mutants showed the strongest phenotypes and both genes control a complex gene network of secondarily regulated genes, including <i>chi1</i> and <i>aqp1</i> These new insights into the initial phase of mucormycosis define genetic regulators and molecular processes that could serve as pharmacological targets.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Mucorales are a group of ancient saprophytic fungi that cause neglected infectious diseases collectively known as mucormycoses. The molecular processes underlying the establishment and progression of this disease are largely unknown. Our work presents a transcriptomic study to unveil the <i>Mucor circinelloides</i> genetic network triggered in fungal spores in response to phagocytosis by macrophages and the transcriptional response of the host cells. Functional characterization of differentially expressed fungal genes revealed three transcription factors and three extracellular proteins essential for the fungus to survive and germinate inside the phagosome and to cause disease in mice. Two of the transcription factors, highly similar to activating transcription factors (ATFs), coordinate a complex secondary gene response involved in pathogenesis. The significance of our research is in characterizing the initial stages that lead to evasion of the host innate immune response and, in consequence, the dissemination of the infection. This genetic study offers possible targets for novel antifungal drugs against these opportunistic human pathogens."
30723078,infection control,"Neutrophil migration to the site of bacterial infection is a critical step in host defense. Exclusively produced in the bone marrow, neutrophil release into the blood is tightly controlled. Although the chemokine CXCL1 induces neutrophil influx during bacterial infections, its role in regulating neutrophil recruitment, granulopoiesis, and neutrophil mobilization in response to lung infection-induced sepsis is unclear. Here, we used a murine model of intrapulmonary <i>S. pneumoniae</i> infection to investigate the role of CXCL1 in host defense, granulopoiesis, and neutrophil mobilization. Our results demonstrate that CXCL1 augments neutrophil influx to control bacterial growth in the lungs as well as bacterial dissemination, resulting in improved host survival. This was shown in <i>Cxcl1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice, which exhibited defective amplification of early neutrophil precursors in granulocytic compartments, and CD62L and CD49d-dependent neutrophil release from the marrow. Administration of recombinant CXCL2 and CXCL5 after infection rescues the impairments in neutrophil-dependent host defense in <i>Cxcl1</i><sup>-/-</sup> mice.

30721607,infection control,"To effectively control malaria, it is necessary to identify landscapes that are most favorable for its transmission. To achieve this goal, the authors developed landscape malariological zoning of Southern Uzbekistan as the most problematic area for malaria in the country. For landscape malariological zoning, the investigators applied the method developed by A.Ya.Lysenko et al. (1956), which allowed identification of different types of malariogenic landscapes, by using the existing scheme of physical and geographical zoning. The existing physical and geographical areas identified were assigned malariological characteristics, which permitted assessment of the landscapes of Southern Uzbekistan from the point of view of whether there is a risk of local malaria transmission. The zoning could identify 5 types of malariogenic landscapes. The most malariologically dangerous areas are the landscapes of lowland river valleys and irrigated (irrigation channel)-lands, where there is the larg- est area of anophelogenic reservoirs. The malariological situation in the low-hill landscapes depends on the situation in the lowland river and irrigation channel landscapes. An epidemic outbreak may occur in the mid-mountain landscapes if a large number of an infection carrier and source are present. The results can be used to optimize anti-malarial interventions, prognosis, and prevention of malaria resumption in the area under study."
30721604,infection control,"Lungworm infection is caused by a Dictyocaulus filaria nematode parasitizing the bronchi and bronchioles of sheep and goats. Various anthelmintics, including albendazole, levamisole, fenbendazole, ivermectins, and others, are used to treat the animals. The aim of this investigation was to study the impact of lungworm infestation on the biochemical parameters of animals during combination treatment with albendazole and T- and B-activin. Experiments were carried out in 20 uninfected mongrel lambs aged 4-5 months. Infectious D.filaria larvae were given with water to 15 lambs once orally at a dose of 1000 larvae per head. 5 uninfected lambs served as a control group. The time course of changes in serum bio- chemical parameters was studied in animals. Treatment with Albena in combination with T- and B-activin in lambs ex- perimentally infested with lungworm was found to restore their biochemical reactivity. After sheep treatment with Albena alone, biochemical parameters were noted to tend to normalize, but their normal full recovery did not take place."
30721601,infection control,"West Nile fever (WNF) is a natural focal vector-borne disease; the main vectors are mosquitoes. Specific means for its prevention are not available; therefore, one of the main areas of WNF epidemiological surveillance is entomological monitoring that encompasses the control of the size ofvector populations arid the determination of infection rate of mos- quitoes with the virus in order to predict the epidemic situation. An analysis of normative documents on the collection and control of mosquito populations showed it necessary to improve entomological monitoring. Based on the literary and their own data, the authors propose to catch only Culix mosquitoes in the foci of WNF and to analyze their infection rates. The mosquitoes should be caught in mid-June to mid-September in the stationary points of urban and rural biotopes once every 7-10 days, by using automatic traps with CO₂ as an attractant. At least 500 specimens should be examined for virus RNA by PCR every 7-10 days to predict the epidemic situation."
30716853,infection control,"During the summers of 2008 and 2010, leaf and shoot blight, wilting of the tips of young infected shoots, and cankers with brown discoloration on twigs were observed on six dog rosehip (Rosa canina) plants from four different private orchards in Eregli district of Konya Province, Turkey. Disease incidence was estimated to be approximately 0.5% on rosehips over 2 years within all survey areas, and surveys showed that ~4 ha was infested. Bacteria isolated from diseased leaf and shoot tissues was macerated and streaked on nutrient sucrose agar (NSA) and King's medium B (KB). Typical light cream, levan-positive colonies developed on NSA medium after a 2-day incubation at 25°C. Colonies on KB were white and non-fluorescent (1). Bacterial strains were identified on the basis of biochemical, physiological (2), and molecular tests (3). Eleven representative bacterial strains isolated were gram-negative, rod-shaped, mucoid, fermentative, yellow-orange on Miller & Scroth medium, positive for levan formation and acetoin production, no growth at 36°C, positive for gelatin hydrolysis, and negative for esculin hydrolysis, indole, urease, catalase, oxidase, arginine dehydrolase, reduction of nitrate, and acid production from lactose and inositol. Two reference strains of Erwinia amylovora (Burr.) Winslow et al. (Ea43b and NCPPB 2791) obtained from culture collection of Selcuk University, Department of Plant Protection, Turkey, were used as positive controls. All strains induced a hypersensitive response in tobacco (Nicotiana tabaccum cv. White Burley) plants within 24 h after inoculation with a 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml bacterial suspension in sterilized distilled water (SDW) (~50 μl), and the strains produced ooze on inoculated immature pear fruit slices cv. Ankara. All strains were identified as E. amylovora using the species-specific primers set A/B (A: 5' CGGTTTTTAACGCTGGG 3' and B: 5' GGGCAAATACTCGGATT 3') (3) by PCR assay to generate a 1-kb DNA fragment, and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) profiles determined by Sherlock Microbial Identification System software with similarity indices ranging from 84 to 97%. Pathogenicity was tested by inserting a suspension (10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml SDW) of each of the 11 bacterial strains and two references strains into actively growing shoot tips and petioles of 4-year-old plants of Rosa canina using a 0.46-mm-diameter hypodermic needle. Leaf and shoot blight symptoms resembling the natural infection were developed on the inoculated plants 7 to 10 days after inoculation. SDW was injected similarly as a negative control treatment, and no symptoms were observed on the control plants. All tests were repeated three times. Re-isolations were done from shoots and leaves of inoculated plants with the two reference strains and the 11 bacteria, and control plants. Obtaining bacteria were identified as E. amylovora using the biochemical, physiological, and molecular tests described above, but this bacterium was not isolated from the control plants. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. amylovora on rosehip in Turkey. References: (1) R. A. Lelliott and D. E. Stead.

30716843,infection control,"Citrus canker, caused by Xanthomonas citri pv. citri, is a bacterial disease of economic importance in tropical and sub-tropical citrus-producing areas (EPPO-PQR online database). X. citri pv. citri causes severe infection in a wide range of citrus species, and induces erumpent, callus-like lesions with water-soaked margins leading to premature fruit drop and twig dieback. It has consequently been subjected to eradication efforts and international regulations. It was first described on the African continent in South Africa at the beginning of the 20th century, from which it was eventually eradicated. Since 2006, several outbreaks caused by phylogenetically diverse strains of X. citri pv. citri have been reported from several African countries (Ethiopia, Mali, Senegal, and Somalia). In July 2011, citrus canker in Burkina Faso was suspected in the area adjacent to the Sikassso Province of Mali where X. citri pv. citri has been confirmed. In November and December 2012, leaves of clementine (Citrus clementina), lemon (C. limon), Volkamer lemon (C. volkameriana), sweet orange (C. sinensis), tangelo (C. paradisi× C. reticulata), and mandarin (C. reticulata) were collected from orchards with trees showing symptoms of citrus canker in the Comoé, Houet, and Kénédougou provinces of Burkina Faso. Isolations performed using KC semi-selective medium (4) recovered 45 Xanthomonas-like strains. All Xanthomonas-like strains were tentatively identified as X. citri pv. citri by PCR (4/7 primers) using IAPAR 306 and sterile distilled water as the positive and negative controls, respectively (3). Among these, two strains (LK4-4 and LK4-5) produced a 'fuscans'-like brown diffusible pigment, a phenotype never reported previously for X. citri pv. citri. MultiLocus Sequence Analysis targeting six housekeeping genes (atpD, dnaK, efp, gltA, gyrB, and lepA) (1,2) fully identified seven strains from Burkina Faso (LJ301-1, LJ303-1, LK1-1, LK2-6, LK4-3, LK4-4, and LK4-5) as X. citri pv. citri (and not to any other Xanthomonas pathovars pathogenic to citrus or host range-restricted pathotypes of pathovar citri), and more specifically as sequence type ST2 which is composed mostly of pathotype A strains of X. citri pv. citri (2). The same seven strains were inoculated to at least four leaves of each of grapefruit cv. Henderson, Mexican lime SRA 140 (C. aurantifolia), Tahiti lime SRA 58 (C. latifolia), and sweet orange cv. Washington Navel, using a detached leaf assay (2). All strains developed typical erumpent, callus-like tissue at wound sites on all citrus species inoculated. No lesions developed on the negative control (sterile 10 mM tris buffer). Koch's postulate was fulfilled after reisolation of Xanthomonas-like yellow colonies from symptoms on Mexican lime produced by the seven strains. Boiled bacterial suspensions were assayed by PCR with 4/7 primers (3) and produced the expected 468-bp amplicon in contrast with the PCR negative control. To our knowledge, this is the first report of X. citri pv. citri in Burkina Faso. Citrus canker-free nurseries and grove sanitation should be implemented for reducing the prevalence of Asiatic canker in Burkina Faso and a thorough survey of citrus nurseries and groves in the region should be conducted.

30716838,infection control,"Eutypa dieback threatens the sustainability of vineyards worldwide and limited treatments are available for control of the disease in grapevine. Following the loss of the effective benzimidazole fungicides, benomyl and carbendazim, there is a need to identify alternatives for the protection of pruning wounds against infection by ascospores of Eutypa lata. In this study, 24 fungicide and natural treatments were evaluated in the laboratory and field. Tebuconazole and carbendazim were the most effective fungicides for reducing colonization of pruning wounds inoculated with E. lata. Pyrimethanil and fluazinam also provided some control but were less effective than tebuconazole at the rates tested. Other treatments, such as cyprodinil + fludioxionil, pyraclostrobin, a garlic extract, and lactoferrin, reduced colonization of wounds by E. lata but require further evaluation at higher concentrations. Carbendazim applied to pruning wounds using tractor-driven sprayers reduced the incidence of pruning wound infection by E. lata to levels similar to that achieved by application with a paint brush."
30716836,infection control,"In the process of searching antibacterial agents from plants, we discovered that the methanol extract of Sedum takesimense showed potent antibacterial activity against Ralstonia solanacearum in vitro and in vivo. Eight antibacterial gallotannins were isolated from the aerial parts of S. takesimense and identified as gallic acid, methyl gallate, 4,6-di-O-galloylarbutin, 2,6-di-O-galloylarbutin, 2,4,6-tri-O-galloyl-glucose, 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-glucose, 1,2,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-glucose, and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-glucose based on electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. These gallotannins displayed broad-spectrum activity against various plant-pathogenic bacteria, and the strongest in vitro antibacterial activities of these gallotannins were against R. solanacearum minimum inhibitory concentration = 0.02 to 0.10 g/liter). Among these gallotannins, methyl gallate and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-β-glucose showed the strongest activities. In addition, synergistic or partial synergistic effects were observed in most combinations between major antibacterial compounds. The wettable powder formulation of the S. takesimense crude extract effectively reduced the development of tomato bacterial wilt caused by R. solanacearum under greenhouse conditions for 14 days after infection. This is the first report on the isolation of antibacterial compounds from S. takesimense. These results suggest that the extract from S. takesimense or the isolated gallotannins could be used as natural bactericides for the control of tomato bacterial wilt."
30716829,infection control,"Dapple plum and peach fruit is a widely distributed disorder of plum and peach resulting in significant economic losses (4). During a survey for the presence of Hop stunt viroid (HSVd) on stone fruit trees in Greece, samples from 30 European plums (Prunus domestica L., cvs. President, Tuleu Grass), 45 Japanese plums (Prunus salicina Lindl., cvs. Angeleno, Diamond, Santa Rosa), 12 cherry plums (Prunus domestica L. var. insititia (L.) Fiori & Paoletti of unknown cultivar), and 107 peaches (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch, cvs. Red Haven, Elberta, June Gold, Spring Crest, Lemonato) were collected in several orchards around Greece. Their fruit skin symptomatology indicated viroid infection (reddish dappling blotches and cracks in European and Japanese plum, green dappling in cherry plum, and light colored blotches and lines in peach). Samples were screened with tissue-print hybridization (TPH) for HSVd using a full length DIG-labelled riboprobe deriving from in vitro transcription of the positive control, a citrus isolate of HSVd (G. Vidalakis, CCPP, University of California, Riverside). In total, 44 out of the 194 trees surveyed were HSVd-positive with TPH. For a small number (40) of TPH-positive field samples, TNA phenol extraction from fruit skin, leaves, and bark and one-tube two-step reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assays followed, using a standardized protocol (3) with two different primer pairs, one new primer pair (this study) and a previously reported primer pair (2). RT-PCR analysis showed the presence of HSVd in peach and Japanese plum in prefectures Pella (Central Macedonia), Achaia, and Korinthia (Peloponnesus) and in cherry plum in Achaia (Peloponnesus). Six of 11 Japanese plums (cvs. Angeleno, Santa Rosa), 2 of 12 cherry plums, and 8 of 12 peaches (cvs. Spring Crest, Red Haven) examined were found HSVd-infected, but none of the five European plums were. Nucleotide sequence analyses of purified and cloned amplicons from peaches and Japanese and cherry plums revealed sizes of 297 to 308 nt and similarity to sequence variants of other HSVd isolates previously characterized: 95 to 97% identity with the Moroccan isolates apr.9, apr.10, apr.11, and apr.12 and the Spanish isolate apr.4 from apricot (1) (GenBank Accession Nos. AJ297825 to AJ297828 and Y09346, respectively). For confirmation of HSVd presence in field trees, 10 Japanese plums cv. Angeleno, 10 peaches cv. June Gold, and 10 peaches cv. Spring Crest, HSVd-negative (TPH), were bud- or chip-grafted from two of the aforementioned Japanese plums cv. Angeleno and two of the aforementioned peaches cv. Red Haven. Two years later, five Japanese plum trees (cv. Angeleno) and five peach trees (three cv. Spring Crest and two cv. June Gold) were found HSVd-positive with TPH; no fruits were observed to produce fruit symptoms as the grafted trees were kept in an insect-proof greenhouse (no bees for cross-pollination). To our knowledge, our investigation reports for the first time the occurrence of HSVd infecting Japanese plum, cherry plum, and peach in Greece, emphasizing the need for a certification program for the prevention of spreading stone fruit tree viroids in this country.

30716826,infection control,"Verticillium dahliae is a ubiquitous soilborne fungus and the causal agent of smoke tree vascular wilt, which presents a major threat to the famous ""red-leaf"" scenery of the Fragrant Hills Park in Beijing, China. In this study, we detected the presence of the fungus based on the amount of fungal DNA in planta and in the soil by using quantitative nested real-time polymerase chain reaction (QNRT-PCR). The QNRT-PCR assay results were highly specific for V. dahliae and could detect disease wilt dynamics over time in different plant tissues. Tests with QNRT-PCR in infested soils showed the detection of soil inoculum densities as low as 1 microsclerotium/g of soil. The QNRT-PCR data showed strong correlation between the quantity of pathogen DNA and the Verticillium wilt disease severity rating, suggesting that quantification of V. dahliae soil inoculum could be conducted to assess Verticillium wilt risk before planting. These data indicate that QNRT-PCR is a sensitive and reliable method to monitor the soilborne pathogen V. dahliae in planta and in soil. The results of this study can be useful in the development of new disease control measures for Verticillium wilt and assessment of the risk of V. dahliae infection of smoke tree before planting."
30716820,infection control,"Rhizoctonia solani causes economically important diseases on potatoes and sugarbeet throughout the world (2). R. solani is a species complex of 13 anastomosis groups (AGs) of which R. solani AG3-PT is most commonly associated with potato and AG2-2 and AG4 with sugarbeet. However, several AGs, including AG2-2 and AG4, have been recorded causing potato diseases (2,3). In summer 2012, plants in potato fields in Idaho were sampled for R. solani. Isolations were attempted from symptomatic plants. DNA extracted from the resulting pure Rhizoctonia cultures was screened using a real-time PCR assay for AG3-PT (3). For the isolates that tested negative for AG3-PT, AG was determined by amplifying and sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region using the primers ITS5 (5'-GGAAGTAAAAGTCGTAACAAGG-3') and ITS4 (5'-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3'). The resulting sequences of two isolates (isolates 204 and 206, GenBank Accession No. KC782951) shared 99% identity with other AG-A isolates (AY927358 and AY927356). Koch's postulates were confirmed for isolate 206 by placing five 10-mm plugs, from 10-day-old potato dextrose agar (PDA) cultures, onto the surface of a soil-less potting mix (composed of peat moss, perlite, and sand) of 1-liter pots, where non-inoculated PDA plugs served as a control. Each pot contained a 'Rosara' seed tuber or three ungerminated (BETASEED - BTS 27RR10) sugarbeet seeds (n = 5). Pots were incubated in a glasshouse between 18 and 22°C for 1 month and then assessed for disease. For potatoes, a pigmented necrosis was observed at the soil interface in 88% of the stems and plants were stunted relative to the non-inoculated controls. A significant reduction in root growth was observed in 60% of the germinated sugarbeet plants. Control plants of both potatoes and beets were asymptomatic. For reisolation, 1-cm sections were taken from each potato stem and germinated beet plant, surface sterilized, and placed on alkaline water agar. The reisolated fungi were identified using morphology and a subset was confirmed by sequencing. Isolate 206 was successfully recovered from 84% of the potato stems and from 20% of the sugarbeet seedlings. In a similar experiment, 2-month-old potato and sugarbeet plants were inoculated using 50 g of autoclaved barley grains (inoculated with isolate 206) per 1-liter pot. Between 40 and 60% of inoculated plants appeared stunted in both cases. Pigmented necrosis was observed at the soil interface on 45% of the potato stems and reduced root growth was observed in the 50% of the sugarbeet plants. Control plants were asymptomatic. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the binucleate AG-A causing disease in Idaho on potato stems. BNR species have previously been isolated from potato (4) and sugarbeet plants (1). The binucleate Rhizoctonia AG-A caused disease on potato stems and sugarbeet roots and was readily reisolated. Since sugarbeet is commonly grown in rotation with potato in Idaho, such a rotation could increase the risk of soilborne infection to either crop by AG-A. It is known that AGs can differ in fungicide sensitivity (2), and thus a knowledge of which AGs may be present is important when considering disease management strategies. References: (1) C. A.

30716817,infection control,"In May 2009, a severe bacterial disease of arecanut (Areca catechu L.) with an incidence of 100% was observed in a plantation of about 8,400 plants in Wenchang City, Hainan Province, China (19°47.171' N, 110°54.335' E). Symptoms consisted of small circular to elongated brown lesions, ranging from 1 to 105 mm in length and 1 to 21 mm in width, surrounded by yellow halos. White colonies, without fluorescent or diffusible pigments, were consistently recovered on King's B Medium plates from lesions surface-sterilized in 70% ethyl alcohol for 1 min. All isolates were gram-negative and each had a single, polar, sheathed flagellum. Isolates were identified as a Burkholderia sp. based on physiological and biochemical tests: oxidase and catalase positive, negative for arginine dihydrolase, gelatin hydrolysis and starch hydrolysis, and negative for acid production from levan (1,3). Sequences (approx. 1,400 bp each) of the 16S rRNA gene amplified from four isolates using primer pair 27F/1492R (2) (GenBank Accession Nos. JX415481, JX415479, JX415482, and JX415483) shared 99% sequence identity with that of Burkholderia andropogonis strain 6369 (DQ786951). Representative isolates Y11 (China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center No. CGMCC 1.12337), Y30 (CGMCC 1.12338), W15, and W20 were compared with B. andropogonis strain NCPPB No. 1012 and all caused a hypersensitive reaction on leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana. Isolate pathogenicity was tested twice with a total of three replications per isolate. Two young leaves each of 2-year-old arecanut plants were infiltrated with a bacterial suspension of 10<sup>8</sup> CFU/ml, then covered individually with plastic bags for 48 h, and incubated at 100% relative humidity with 16 h of daylight at 25°C by day and 8 h of darkness at 20°C by night. After 7 days, small water-soaked spots with yellow halos were observed and 60 days after inoculation, lesions developed similar to those caused by B. andropogonis in the field. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by reisolating bacteria from typical lesions on inoculated plants. These bacteria were identical to inoculated strains in colony morphology and sequences of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. To our knowledge, this is the first report of B. andropogonis infection on betel in Hainan Province, mainland China. This disease was first reported in Taiwan, a province of China. Conditions of high humidity and high temperature support disease outbreaks and infection can result in severe economic losses. In 2012, this disease also appeared on a number of plantations located in other counties. As betel is, economically, the second most important crop in Hainan Province, measures should be required to control this disease, especially in typhoon seasons. References: (1) S. H. Hseu et al.

30721932,infection control,"Aging negatively impacts immunity, resulting in inefficient responses to vaccinations and infections. Fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs) are the major stromal cell subset in lymph nodes (LN) and play an intricate role in the orchestration and control of adaptive immune responses. Although stromal cells have a major impact on immune responses, the impact of aging on LN stromal cells remains unclear. Quantitative analysis of LN stromal cells by flow cytometry revealed that there are no significant differences in the number of stromal cells in young and aged LN at steady state but after influenza infection aged FRCs have delayed expansion as a result of reduced proliferation. Aged LNs also produce reduced levels of homeostatic chemokines, which correlates with reduced homing of naive T cells. Image analysis reveals that young and aged T cell zone FRCs have similar morphology at steady state and after infection. Furthermore, aged FRCs did not appear to be a contributing factor in the reduced proliferation of young T cells transferred into aged LNs after influenza infection. These results demonstrate that aging alters LN stromal cell response to challenge and these age-related changes may be an underlying contributor to impaired immune responses in the elderly."

30721776,infection control,"Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) causes hepatopancreatic microsporidiosis (HPM) in shrimp. HPM is not normally associated with shrimp mortality, but is associated with significant growth retardation. In this study, the responses induced by EHP were investigated in hepatopancreas of shrimp Litopenaeus vannamei using proteomics and metabolomics. Among differential proteins identified, several (e.g., peritrophin-44-like protein, alpha2 macroglobulin isoform 2, prophenoloxidase-activating enzymes, ferritin, Rab11A and cathepsin C) were related to pathogen infection and host immunity. Other proteomic biomarkers (i.e., farnesoic acid o-methyltransferase, juvenile hormone esterase-like carboxylesterase 1 and ecdysteroid-regulated protein) resulted in a growth hormone disorder that prevented the shrimp from molting. Both proteomic KEGG pathway (e.g., ""Glycolysis/gluconeogenesis"" and ""Glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism"") and metabolomic KEGG pathway (e.g., ""Galactose metabolism"" and ""Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids"") data indicated that energy metabolism pathway was down-regulated in the hepatopancreas when infected by EHP. More importantly, the changes of hormone regulation and energy metabolism could provide much-needed insight into the underlying mechanisms of stunted growth in shrimp after EHP infection. Altogether, this study demonstrated that proteomics and metabolomics could provide an insightful view into the effects of microsporidial infection in the shrimp L. vannamei."
30721732,infection control,"In recent years, approaches to tracking the spread of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as part of outbreak management have used conventional DNA-based methods including pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and spa typing. However, when a predominant clone is present, these methods may be insufficiently discriminatory. We conducted a literature search to highlight how whole genome sequencing (WGS) has revolutionised the investigation of outbreaks of MRSA, including intra-hospital spread and MRSA in the community, and to review its future potential. Whole genome sequencing provides enhanced isolate discrimination, as it permits the entire genomic DNA sequence of isolates to be rapidly determined and compared. Many software packages used for the analysis of WGS data are becoming increasingly available. To date WGS has been more sensitive in confirming outbreaks, often persisting for prolonged periods, previously undetected by conventional molecular typing. The evolving dynamic of spread from the community to hospitals, within and between hospitals, and from hospitals to the community, is only becoming clear with WGS studies, and is more complex and convoluted than widely appreciated. Also, WGS can exclude cross-transmission, when isolates are different. The challenges now are to make WGS technology more amenable for routine use and to develop an evidence-based consensus for sequence difference thresholds for isolates that they are deemed part of the same outbreak, including protracted outbreaks. Using such data in a timely way will provide increased sensitivity in detecting cross-transmission events earlier with the potential of preventing outbreaks to positively impact on infection prevention and control."
30721647,infection control,"<b>Background:</b>The aim of this study was to determine the 3-month efficacy of a single-session, clinic-based intervention promoting condom use for anal and oral sex among HIV-uninfected Black young men who have sex with men (YBMSM). <b>Methods:</b> A pre-post test randomised controlled trial (RCT) was conducted from 2012 to 2015 using a 3-month period of observation. Recruitment and assessment occurred in sexually transmissible infection (STI) clinics. Men were randomised to either the intervention condition (n=142) or a standard-of-care control condition (n=135). The experimental condition comprised a single session of a one-to-one program designed for use in STI clinics. YBMSM completed both baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. Outcomes measures were condomless anal insertive sex, condomless anal receptive sex and condomless oral sex. <b>Results:</b> Among men receiving the intervention, 11.2% (n=15) reported any condomless anal insertive sex at follow-up, compared with 20.6% (n=27) among controls (rate ratio=0.54, P=0.04). In addition, 12.0% (n=17) of men receiving the intervention reported any condomless anal receptive sex at follow-up, compared with 21.6% (n=29) among controls (rate ratio=0.55, P=0.03). When combining insertive and receptive anal sex, 18.3% (n=26) of men receiving the intervention reported any condomless sex, compared with 31.1% (n=42) among controls (rate ratio=0.59, P=0.01). Furthermore, 45.8% (n=33) of men receiving the intervention reported any condomless oral sex at follow-up, compared with 63.2% (n=48) among controls (rate ratio=0.72, P=0.03). <b>Conclusions:</b> This analysis of data from a Phase 3 RCT suggests that a single session of a clinic-based behavioural intervention may effectively promote the consistent use of condoms for anal and oral sex among HIV-uninfected YBMSM. The single-session program may be a valuable counselling tool for use in conjunction with recommended quarterly clinic appointments for YBMSM using pre-exposure prophylaxis."
30721460,infection control,"Since molecular genotyping has been established for the Candida species, studies have found that a single Candida strain (endemic strain) can persist over a long period of time and results in the spread of nosocomial invasive candidiasis without general characteristics of horizontal transmissions. Our previous study also found the existence of endemic strains in a cancer center in Tianjin, China. In the current study, we performed further investigation on endemic and non-endemic Candida albicans strains, with the aim of explaining the higher morbidity of endemic strains. In an in vivo experiment, mice infected with endemic strains showed significantly shorter survival time and higher kidney fungal burdens compared to mice infected with non-endemic strains. In an in vitro experiment, the killing percentage of neutrophils to endemic strains was significantly lower than that to non-endemic strains, which is positively linked to the ratio of LC3B-II/I in neutrophils. An immunofluorescence assay showed more β-1,3-glucan exposure on the cell walls of nonendemic strains compared to endemic strains. After blocking the β-glucan receptor (CR3) or inhibiting downstream kinase (SYK) in neutrophils, the killing percent to C. albicans (regardless of endemic and non-endemic strains) and the ratio of LC3B-II/I of neutrophils were significantly decreased. These data suggested that the killing capability of neutrophils to C. albicans was monitored by β-1,3-glucan via CR3/SYK pathway-dependent LC3B-II accumulation and provided an explanation for the variable killing capability of neutrophils to different strains of C. albicans, which would be beneficial in improving infection control and therapeutic strategies for invasive candidiasis."
30721418,infection control,"There is a significant association exists between vitamin D deficiencies, low respiratory tract infections, and certain types of VDR gene polymorphism. Various studies are being conducted to prove any such link between the different clinical conditions due to disturbed vitamin D regulation and VDR gene polymorphisms. The present study analyzed the presence of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms (ApaI and TaqI) in Saudi pediatric patient suffering from acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRTI) cases. Fifty children (50) with ALRTI admitted at King Saud University Medical City, Riyadh/Saudi Arabia were included in addition to seventy-three (73) apparently healthy children who were considered as the control group. Genomic DNA from whole blood was extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) targeting TaqI and ApaI VDR polymorphisms. RFLP-PCR genotyping was performed to determine the allelic frequency within the VDR gene. In the whole sample, the allelic frequency of ApaI polymorphism in the VDR gene was 58.5%, 17.9%, and 23.6% for AA, Aa, and aa respectively (p = 0.11), while it was 48%, 19%, and 33% for TT, Tt, and tt respectively (p = 0.33) with regards to the frequency of TaqI polymorphism in the VDR gene. VDR ApaI Aa and aa genotypes and VDR TaqI Tt and tt genotypes were not associated with increased risk of ALRTI in children (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.33-2.28, p = 0.77; OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.23-1.4, p = 0.21; OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.44-2.99, p = 0.77; OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.32-1.68, p = 0.46 respectively). To conclude, neither vitamin D status nor VDR gene polymorphisms such as ApaI and TaqI is associated with increased susceptibility to ALRTI. Linkage disequilibrium was not detected between ApaI and TaqI VDR gene polymorphisms as in the case of serum vitamin D status in ALRTI patients versus apparent healthy children."
30721272,infection control,"Leishmaniasis encompasses a group of diverse clinical diseases caused by protozoan parasites of the Leishmania genus. This disease is a major public health problem in the New World affecting people exposed in endemic regions. The city of Governador Valadares (Minas Gerais/Brazil) is a re-emerging area for visceral leishmaniasis, with 191 human cases reported from 2008 to 2017 and a lethality rate of 14.7%. The transmission of the parasite occurs intensely in this region with up to 22% of domestic dogs with positive serology for the visceral form. Lu. longipalpis is one of the most abundant sand fly species in this area. Despite this scenario, so far there is no information regarding the circulating Leishmania species in the insect vector Lutzomyia longipalpis in this focus. We collected 616 female Lutzomyia longipalpis sand flies between January and September 2015 in the Vila Parque Ibituruna neighborhood (Governador Valadares/MG), which is located on a transitional area between the sylvatic and urban environments with residences built near a preserved area. After DNA extraction of individual sand flies, the natural Leishmania infections in Lu. longipalpis were detected by conventional PCR, using primers derived from kDNA sequences, specific for L. (Leishmania) or L. (Viannia) subgenus. The sensitivity of these PCR reactions was 0.1 pg of DNA for each Leishmania subgenus and the total infection rate of 16.2% (100 positive specimens). Species-specific PCR detected the presence of multiple Leishmania species in infected Lu. longipalpis specimens in Governador Valadares, including L. amazonensis (n = 3), L. infantum (n = 28), L. (Viannia) spp. (n = 20), coinfections with L. infantum and L. (Viannia) spp. (n = 5), and L. (Leishmania) spp (n = 44). Our results demonstrate that multiple Leishmania species circulate in Lu. longipalpis in Governador Valadares and reveal a potential increasing risk of transmission of the different circulating parasite species. This information reinforces the need for epidemiological and entomological surveillance in this endemic focus, and the development of effective control strategies against leishmaniasis."

Major factors that are resulting in this trend are the irrational and excessive use of antibiotics. Children account for a greater population of antibiotics use, therefore, an educational intervention on the rational use of antibiotics for children and caregivers will be beneficial. (2) Methods: A randomized controlled and parallel group study of fifth grade children and their caregivers will be evaluated in four primary schools in Baoji and Weinan of the Shaanxi Province. Two primary schools will be randomly selected for the educational intervention and two schools will serve as a control group. In the intervention arm, educational interventions will be conducted among caregivers and their children. The intervention measures include interactive training sessions, booklets, and printed or electronic educational materials that will be given to the caregivers or the school-aged children. In the control arm, no interventions will be implemented. Baseline data collected from June, 2018 and the intervention will last for three months. Knowledge-Attitude-Practice (KAP) questionnaires will be used to evaluate the caregivers' knowledge, their attitude, and their practice. Knowledge-Retention questionnaires will be used to assess the children's knowledge about microbes, antibiotics, and hygiene. (3) Discussion: This study is a unique comprehensive intervention targeting both children and their caregivers. We hypothesize a decrease in the irrational use of antibiotics among the studied population. Hence, this result would provide evidence for policy makers and educational departments for the implementation of similar interventions on the rational use of antibiotics."
30720777,infection control,"(1) <i>Background:</i> Current international policy for schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis (STH) control emphasises mass administration of deworming drugs in school-based programmes. However, this approach is insufficient to control the transmission of these diseases, and their burden in non-school cohorts is recognised, albeit under-researched. This research will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of expanding access to praziquantel (PZQ) against schistosomiasis, and albendazole (ALB) against STH, to communities in selected transmission settings in Ghana. (2) <i>Methods:</i> A three-site longitudinal study will be implemented to investigate the effectiveness of expanding treatment strategies for PZQ and ALB to community members. In the context of community mass drug administration (to preschool children, school non-attending children, and adults, including pregnant women), the intervention will be assessed in a random sample of community members, at baseline with follow-up at 6, 12, and 18 months. In each community, 658 participants will be enrolled, and 314 followed up at each time point. The primary outcome measure is the prevalence of infection of <i>Schistosoma haematobium</i> and/or <i>S. mansoni</i> at study endpoint, as assessed by longitudinal surveys. Secondary outcomes are to quantify the infection of schistosomiasis and STH infections in non-treated cohorts, reductions in prevalence of STH, and intensity of schistosomiasis and STH, and treatment coverage. Nested within this study will be qualitative, cost-benefit, and cost-effectiveness evaluations that will explore accessibility, feasibility, and economic impact of expanded treatment from different complementary perspectives. (3) <i>Discussion:</i> Using a multidisciplinary approach, this study will generate evidence for improved availability, acceptability, affordability, and accessibility to deworming drugs against schistosomiasis and STH to individuals and communities in Ghana. This is likely to have considerable research, programmatic, and political value to contribute evidence for national programme policy development within Ghana, and, more broadly, World Health Organization policy development."
30720762,infection control,"A pathogenic lifestyle is inextricably linked with the constant necessity of facing various challenges exerted by the external environment (both within and outside the host). To successfully colonize the host and establish infection, pathogens have evolved sophisticated systems to combat the host defense mechanisms and also to be able to withstand adverse environmental conditions. Proteases, as crucial components of these systems, are involved in a variety of processes associated with infection. In phytopathogenic bacteria, they play important regulatory roles and modulate the expression and functioning of various virulence factors. Secretory proteases directly help avoid recognition by the plant immune systems, and contribute to the deactivation of the defense response pathways. Finally, proteases are important components of protein quality control systems, and thus enable maintaining homeostasis in stressed bacterial cells. In this review, we discuss the known protease functions and protease-regulated signaling processes associated with virulence of plant pathogenic bacteria."

30720356,infection control,"Niche and fitness differences control the outcome of competition, but determining their relative importance in invaded communities-which may be far from equilibrium-remains a pressing concern. Moreover, it is unclear whether classic approaches for studying competition, which were developed predominantly for pairs of interacting species, will fully capture dynamics in complex species assemblages. We parameterized a population-dynamic model using competition experiments of two native and three exotic species from a grassland community. We found evidence for minimal fitness differences or niche differences between the native species, leading to slow replacement dynamics and priority effects, but large fitness advantages allowed exotics to unconditionally invade natives. Priority effects driven by strong interspecific competition between exotic species drove single-species dominance by one of two exotic species in 80% of model outcomes, while a complex mixture of nonhierarchical competition and coexistence between native and exotic species occurred in the remaining 20%. Fungal infection, a commonly hypothesized coexistence mechanism, had weak fitness effects and is unlikely to substantially affect coexistence. In contrast to previous work on pairwise outcomes in largely native-dominated communities, our work supports a role for nearly neutral dynamics and priority effects as drivers of species composition in invaded communities."
30720202,infection control,"Epidemiological studies, animal models, and case-control studies indicate maternal immune activation may be an important factor involved in disease expression of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Tourette syndrome, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). We report eight children (mean age 6y 6mo [range 4-15y]; six males and two females) referred over a 2-year period with at least one of these neurodevelopmental disorders plus a maternal history of thyroid autoimmunity. Seven of eight children presented with an abrupt onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms (OCD [n=6], tics [n=5], and/or psychosis [n=1]), associated with an autistic or global regression. Four children had a pre-existing diagnosis of ASD. Six presentations were preceded by infection, and symptoms followed a relapsing-remitting course in seven children. All children responded to immunomodulatory treatment as indicated by a reduction in psychiatric symptoms, and seven children were also managed with conventional treatment with additional improvement. We propose that maternal autoimmunity can activate fetal microglia or alter transcription of neurodevelopmental vulnerability and/or immune genes in utero, and is an environmental factor that increases the expression and severity of neurodevelopmental problems, and susceptibility to deteriorations after infectious or stress stimuli."

Moreover, genetic factors play an important role in the tumorigenesis of HCC. Here, we demonstrated that Krüppel-like factor2 (KLF2) expression was downregulated in HCC samples compared with adjacent tissues. Additionally, KLF2 was shown to inhibit the growth, migration and colony formation ability of liver cancer cells. Further mechanistic studies revealed that KLF2 can compete with Gli1 for interaction with HDAC1 and restrains Hedgehog signal activation. Together, our results suggest that KLF2 has potential as a diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic target for the treatment of HCC. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
30719451,infection control,"This study aimed to explore periodontal and systemic immune response of overweight hosts to periodontitis. Forty C57 BL/6J male mice were divided into high (HF) or low fat (LF) diet groups and fed with the two diets, respectively, for 8 weeks. Each diet group was then divided into periodontitis (P) or control (C) groups (n = 10 per group) for 10-day ligation or sham-ligation. Overweight-related parameters including body weight were measured. Alveolar bone loss (ABL) was morphometrically analyzed and periodontal osteoclasts were stained. Periodontal immune response including leukocyte and macrophage number and inflammatory cytokines were analyzed by histology and quantitative PCR. Serum cytokine and lipid levels were quantified using electrochemiluminescence immunoassays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and biochemistry. It was found that HF group had 14.4% body weight gain compared with LF group (<i>P</i> < 0.01). ABL and periodontal osteoclast, leukocyte, and macrophage number were higher in P group than C group regardless of diet (<i>P</i> < 0.05). ABL and periodontal osteoclast number were not affected by diet regardless of ligation or sham-ligation. Leukocyte and macrophage number and protein level of tumor necrosis factor <i>α</i> (TNF-<i>α</i>) in periodontium and serum interleukin-6 level were downregulated by HF diet in periodontitis mice (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Periodontal protein level of TNF-<i>α</i> was highly correlated with serum interleukin-6 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (<i>P</i> < 0.01). These findings indicated that impaired immune response occurs both periodontally and systemically in preobesity overweight individuals. Given a well-reported exacerbating effect of obesity on periodontitis, overweight, if let uncontrolled, might place the individuals at potential risk for future periodontal tissue damage."
30719435,infection control,"Austria is officially bovine tuberculosis (TB) free, but during the last decade the west of the country experienced sporadic TB cases in cattle. Free-ranging red deer are known to be the maintenance host of <i>Mycobacterium</i> (<i>M</i>.) <i>caprae</i> in certain areas in Austria, where cattle can become infected on alpine pastures shared with deer. The epidemiology of TB in deer in alpine regions is still poorly understood. To inform decisions on efficient interventions against TB in deer, a method is needed to better capture the infection dynamics on population level. A total of 4,521 free-ranging red deer from Austria's most western Federal state Vorarlberg were TB-tested between 2009 and 2018. <i>M. caprae</i> was confirmed in samples from 257 animals. Based on descriptions of TB-like lesions, TB positive animals were categorized with a newly developed lesion score called ""Patho Score."" Analyses using this Patho Score allowed us to distinguish between endemic, epidemic and sporadic TB situations and revealed different roles of subgroups of infected deer in infection dynamics. Overall, deer in poor condition, deer of older age and stags were the subgroups that were significantly more often TB positive (<i>p</i> = 0.02 or smaller for all subgroups). Deer in poor condition (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and stags (<i>p</i> = 0.04) also showed more often advanced lesions, indicating their role in mycobacterial spread. TB was never detected in fawns, while hinds were the subgroup that showed the fewest advanced lesions. Analysis of outbreaks of TB and lesion development in yearlings provided some evidence for the role of winter feeding as a source for increased infection transmission. Sporadic cases in TB-free areas appear to precede outbreaks in these areas. These currently TB-free areas should receive particular attention in sampling schemes to be able to detect early spreading of the infection. The Patho Score is a quick, easy-to-apply and reproducible tool that provides new insights on the epidemiology of TB in deer at population level and is flexible enough to relate heterogeneous wildlife monitoring data collected following different sampling plans. This lesion score was used for systematic assessment of infection dynamics of mycobacterial infections."
30719427,infection control,"<i>Trichinella</i> spp., are amongst the most widespread parasitic nematodes, primarily live in the muscles of a wide range of vertebrate animals and humans. Human infection occurs by ingestion of raw or undercooked meat containing <i>Trichinella</i> larvae. Accurate diagnosis of <i>Trichinella</i> spp. infection in domestic animals is crucial for the effective prevention and control of human trichinellosis. In the present study, a simple, rapid and accurate diagnostic assay was developed combining recombinase polymerase amplification and a lateral flow strip (LF-RPA) to detect <i>Trichinella</i> spp. infection. The LF-RPA assay targets <i>Trichinella</i> spp. mitochondrial small-subunit ribosomal RNA (<i>rrnS</i>) gene and can detect as low as 100 fg DNA of <i>Trichinella</i> strains, which was approximately 10 times more sensitive than a conventional PCR assay. The LF-RPA assay can be performed within 10-25 min, at a wide range of temperatures (25-45°C) and showed no cross-reactivity with DNA of other parasites and related host species of <i>Trichinella</i>. The performance of the LF-RPA assay in the presence of high concentration of PCR inhibitor was better than that of a conventional PCR assay. Results obtained by LF-RPA assay for the detection of experimentally infected mice were comparable to the results obtained by using a conventional PCR, achieving 100% specificity and high sensitivity. These results present the developed LF-RPA assay as a new simple, specific, sensitive, rapid and convenient method for the detection of <i>Trichinella</i> infection in domestic animals."

30719325,infection control,"Adaptive immunity is essentially required to control acute infection with enteropathogenic <i>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</i> (Yptb). We have recently demonstrated that Yptb can directly modulate naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell differentiation. However, whether fully differentiated forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3<sup>+</sup>) regulatory T cells (Tregs), fundamental key players to maintain immune homeostasis, are targeted by Yptb remains elusive. Here, we demonstrate that within the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment Yptb preferentially targets Tregs and injects Yersinia outer proteins (Yops) in a process that depends on the type III secretion system and invasins. Remarkably, Yop-translocation into ex vivo isolated Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs resulted in a substantial downregulation of Foxp3 expression and a decreased capacity to express the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin-10 (IL-10). Together, these findings highlight that invasins are critically required to mediate Yptb attachment to Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs, which allows efficient Yop-translocation and finally enables the modulation of the Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs' suppressive phenotype."

Using a weight matrix-based program Match, we found the UL54 transcription regulatory sequences binding to the transcription factors Oct-1, v-Myb and Pax-6 in HSV-1-LXMW, while the sequences binding to Oct-1 and Hairy in a HSV-2 strain. Further validation showed that HSV-1 and HSV-2 shared the common sequence binding to Oct-1, but had unique sequences to bind v-Myb and Pax-6, or Hairy, respectively, by DNA sequence alignment of total 11 HSV strains. The published results howed that the expression of transcription factors is consistent with the tissue tropism of HSV-1 and HSV-2. In the current article a new HSV-1 strain LXMW was isolated and its putative HSV UL54 transcription regulatory sequences and factors were identified for the first time.

Therefore the aim of current study is to explore the protective effects and understand the underlying mechanisms for the beneficial effects of live combined <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (LCBE) in cecal ligation puncture (CLP)-induced sepsis. <b>Methods and Results:</b> Seven-week-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into three groups: sham group (6 mice), CLP-control group (20 mice, pretreatment with saline for 7 days before CLP surgery) and CLP-probiotics group (14 mice, pretreatment with LCBE enteric-coated capsules for 7 days before CLP surgery). In survival experiment, mice were monitored for 7 days after CLP. After the procedure, mice were sacrificed, and, serum, and peritoneal lavage fluid were collected and intestinal ileal samples were harvested. <b>Results:</b> Our results showed that the mortality was significantly reduced in mice CLP-probiotics group vs. CLP-control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Also, treatment CLP-probiotics group decreased the injury scores CLP-probiotics group when compared to CLP-control group. Additionally, levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-α levels in the serum and intestinal ileal tissues of CLP-probiotics group were reduced when compared to CLP-control group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). However, no significant differences in anti-inflammatory levels of IL-10 and TGF-β1 were observed between CLP-control and CLP-probiotic groups. Furthermore, our experiments showed that that probiotic treatment suppressed the macrophage activation and transformation from M-type to M1-type, inhibited the mast cells (MCs) degranulation, and activation of AKT (kinase B) pathway. <b>Conclusion:</b> In conclusion, our data shows that probiotics have a protective role in CLP septic mice through reducing intestinal inflammation, altering macrophage polarization and MCs degranulation, and regulating AKT signaling. <b>Significance and Impact of Study:</b> This study demonstrated the protective effects and mechanisms involved in the protective role of live combined <i>Bacillus subtilis</i> and <i>Enterococcus faecium</i> (LCBE) in CLP-induced septic mice model."
30718795,infection control,"Rotavirus (RV), the major etiological agent of viral gastroenteritis in young children, kills over 200 thousand infants each year. In spite of available vaccines, rotaviral diarrhoea is still a major problem in developing countries of Asia and Africa. Therefore, the studies on RV infection and host antiviral responses are warranted. The active correlation between virus infection and activation of autophagy machinery and positive influence of autophagy on RV replication have been documented recently. Previous study from our group showed dysregulation of several cellular miRNAs during RV infection, though their significance remained largely unknown. Since cellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have been implicated in the control of several fundamental biological processes including stress response and autophagy, we focused on two miRNAs, miR-99b and let-7g, and analyzed their function to gain insight into the miRNA-autophagy crosstalk during RV infection. This study shows that RV suppresses let-7g expression but enhances miR-99b that in turn augment major autophagy regulators. Ectopic expression of let-7g and knockdown of miR-99b resulted in inhibition of autophagy, hence, reduction of RV replication. Overall, our study highlights new mechanistic insights for understanding the role of miRNAs in modulating RV infection and possibility of using RNA interference as an antiviral therapeutic target."
30718586,infection control,"Cholera has affected Haiti with damping waves of outbreaks since October 2010. However, mechanisms behind disease persistence during lull periods remain poorly understood. By mid 2014, cholera transmission seemed to only persist in the northern part of Haiti. Meanwhile, cholera appeared nearly extinct in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where it eventually exploded in September 2014. This study aimed to determine whether this outbreak was caused by local undetected cases or by re-importation of the disease from the north. Applying an integrated approach between November 2013 and November 2014, we assessed the temporal and spatial dynamics of cholera using routine surveillance data and performed population genetics analyses of 178 Vibrio cholerae O1 clinical isolates. The results suggest that the northern part of the country exhibited a persisting metapopulation pattern with roaming oligoclonal outbreaks that could not be effectively controlled. Conversely, undetected and unaddressed autochthonous low-grade transmission persisted in the Port-au-Prince area, which may have been the source of the acute outbreak in late-2014. Cholera genotyping is a simple but powerful tool to adapt control strategies based on epidemic specificities. In Haiti, these data have already yielded significant progress in cholera surveillance, which is a key component of the strategy to eventually eliminate cholera."

In this study, we show that <i>L. pneumophila</i> avoids host S phase by blocking host DNA synthesis and preventing cell cycle progression into S phase. Cell cycle arrest upon <i>Legionella</i> contact is dependent on the Icm/Dot secretion system. In particular, we found that cell cycle arrest is dependent on the intact enzymatic activity of translocated substrates that inhibits host translation. Moreover, we show that, early in infection, the presence of these translation inhibitors is crucial to induce the degradation of the master regulator cyclin D1. Our results demonstrate that the bacterial effectors that inhibit translation are associated with preventing entry of host cells into a phase associated with restriction of <i>L. pneumophila</i> Furthermore, control of cyclin D1 may be a common strategy used by intracellular pathogens to manipulate the host cell cycle and promote bacterial replication."
30718396,infection control,"Although climate change may expand the geographical distribution of several vector-borne diseases, the effects of environmental temperature in host defense to viral infection in vivo are unknown. Here, we demonstrate that exposure of mice to the high ambient temperature of 36 °C impaired adaptive immune responses against infection with viral pathogens, influenza, Zika, and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome phlebovirus. Following influenza virus infection, the high heat-exposed mice failed to stimulate inflammasome-dependent cytokine secretion and respiratory dendritic cell migration to lymph nodes. Although commensal microbiota composition remained intact, the high heat-exposed mice decreased their food intake and increased autophagy in lung tissue. Induction of autophagy in room temperature-exposed mice severely impaired virus-specific CD8 T cells and antibody responses following respiratory influenza virus infection. In addition, we found that administration of glucose or dietary short-chain fatty acids restored influenza virus-specific adaptive immune responses in high heat-exposed mice. These findings uncover an unexpected mechanism by which ambient temperature and nutritional status control virus-specific adaptive immune responses."
30718297,infection control,"Control of chronic CNS infection with the parasite <i>Toxoplasma gondii</i> requires ongoing T cell responses in the brain. Immunosuppressive cytokines are also important for preventing lethal immunopathology during chronic infection. To explore the loss of suppressive cytokines exclusively during the chronic phase of infection, we blocked IL-10R in chronically infected mice. Consistent with previous reports, IL-10R blockade led to severe, fatal tissue destruction associated with widespread changes in the inflammatory response, including increased APC activation, expansion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and neutrophil recruitment to the brain. We then sought to identify regulatory mechanisms contributing to IL-10 production, focusing on ICOS, a molecule implicated in IL-10 production. Unexpectedly, ICOS ligand (ICOSL) blockade led to a local expansion of effector T cells in the brain without affecting IL-10 production or APC activation. Instead, we found that ICOSL blockade led to changes in T cells associated with their proliferation and survival. We observed increased expression of IL-2-associated signaling molecules CD25, STAT5 phosphorylation, Ki67, and Bcl-2 in T cells in the brain, along with decreased apoptosis. Interestingly, increases in CD25 and Bcl-2 were not observed following IL-10R blockade. Also, unlike IL-10R blockade, ICOSL blockade led to an expansion of both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the brain, with no expansion of peripheral T cells or neutrophil recruitment to the brain and no severe tissue destruction. Overall, these results suggest that IL-10 and ICOS differentially regulate T cell responses in the brain during chronic <i>T. gondii</i> infection."
30718242,infection control,"Malglycemia (hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, and/or glycemic variability) in adult hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients is associated with increased infection, graft-versus-host disease, organ dysfunction, delayed engraftment, and mortality. Malglycemia has not been studied in pediatric HSCT recipients. This study aimed to characterize the incidence and consequences of malglycemia in this population. Medical records for a cohort of 344 patients, age 0 to 30 years, who underwent first HSCT from 2007 to 2016 at Children's Hospital Colorado were retrospectively reviewed. Glucose data were analyzed in intervals and assessed for potential risk factors and associated outcomes. Malglycemia occurred in 43.9% of patients. Patients with a day 0 to 100 mean glucose of 100 to 124 mg/dL had a 1.76-fold (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.10-2.82; <i>P</i> = .02) increased risk of death and patients with a day 0 to 100 mean glucose ≥ 125 mg/dL had a 7.06-fold (95% CI, 3.84-12.99; <i>P</i> < .0001) increased risk of death compared with patients with a day 0 to 100 mean glucose < 100 mg/dL. For each 10 mg/dL increase in pre-HSCT glucose, there was a 1.11-fold (95% CI, 1.04-1.18; <i>P</i> = .0013) increased risk of post-HSCT infection. These adverse impacts of malglycemia occurred independent of transplant type, graft-versus-host disease, and steroid therapy. Malglycemia in the pediatric HSCT population is independently associated with significantly increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Further research is required to evaluate the utility of glucose control to mitigate these relationships and improve HSCT outcomes. This trial was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT03482154."
30718191,infection control,"Candida blood stream infection (candidemia) is severe systemic infection mainly develops after intensive medical cares. The mortality of candidemia is affected by the underlying conditions, causative agents and the initial management. We retrospectively analyzed mortality-related risk factors in cases of candidemia between April 2011 and March 2016 in five regional hospitals in Japan. We conducted bivariate and multivariate analysis of factors including causative Candida species, patients' predisposing conditions, and treatment strategies, such as empirically selected antifungal drug and time to appropriate antifungal treatment, to elucidate their effects on 30-day mortality. The study enrolled 289 cases of candidemia in adults. Overall 30-day mortality was 27.7%. Forty-nine cases (17.0%) were community-acquired. Bivariate analysis found advanced age, high Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and prior antibiotics use as risk factors for high mortality; however community-acquired candidemia, C. parapsilosis candidemia, obtaining follow-up blood culture, and empiric treatment with fluconazole were associated with low mortality. Logistic regression revealed age ≥65 years (adjusted odds ratio, 2.13) and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score ≥6 (6.30) as risk factors for 30-day mortality. In contrast, obtaining follow-up blood culture (0.38) and empiric treatment with fluconazole (0.32) were found to be protective factors. The cases with candidemia in associated with advanced age and poor general health conditions should be closely monitored. Obtaining follow-up blood culture contributed to an improved prognosis."

30717513,infection control,"A questionnaire survey of 1 000 clinicians having experience in treating uncomplicated lower urinary tract infections from different levels of hospitals was conducted to mainly evaluate the applicability and effectiveness of clinical application of clinical practice guideline on traditional Chinese medicine therapy alone or combined with antibiotics for uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection(hereinafter referred to as Guideline). The research was conducted with the three-level quality control strictly throughout the process, and the data was real and reliable. The survey's results showed that: most clinicians considered that the Guideline had good clinical applicability. The availability and price of the recommended medicine were moderate. Traditional Chinese medicine had obvious features and advantages in treating lower urinary tract infection for it could reduce the usage of antibiotics and shorten the course of antibiotic application. In the recommendation section, clinicians proposed increasing medication guidance, updating the Guideline timely, as well as increasing treating methods and techniques, strengthen propaganda and promotion, and improve the use of evidence-based methods. In the evaluation of effectiveness, the majority of clinicians agreed that the definition in both traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine and differential diagnosis in the Guideline were accurately described and the basic principle of treatment as well as the treating method of TCM were recommended appropriately. The TCM formulas and Chinese patent medicine had good effect. Some clinicians suggested refining the syndrome differentiation of stranguria. Some clinicians considered that the formulas and herbs recommended in Guideline didn't have obvious effect and some had doubts about the manipulation of fumigation and washing in the part of other methods recommended in Guideline. Moreover, specification and procedure of manipulation of fumigation and washing using herbs and the acupuncture included in characteristic TCM therapy treating uncomplicated lower urinary tract infection remained to be developed."
30717420,infection control,"Periprosthetic joint infection in total knee arthroplasty is a significant complication that is a common reason for revision surgery. The current standard of care is two-stage revision surgery. There is however increasing evidence to support the use of single-stage revision surgery. We conducted a PRISMA systematic review of the current evidence on the use of single-stage revision for infected total knee arthroplasty. Four databases (PubMed, Embase, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library) were systematically screened for eligible studies. The risk bias of each study was identified using ROBINS-I tool, and the quality of evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Sixteen articles were retained after applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria that evaluated 3645 knee single-stage revision surgeries. Our review reveals satisfactory outcomes for single-stage revision in the management of infected total knee arthroplasty. The reinfection rates in the studies included in our review varied however the majority reported low reinfection rates and good functional outcomes. Although strict patient selection criteria have yielded successful results, good results were also reported when these criteria were not applied. The greater use of risk factors in identifying patients likely to have a successful outcome needs to be balanced with the practical benefits of performing a single stage procedure in higher risk patients. Future large clinical randomized control trials are required to confirm our results."

30717396,infection control,"The changes in the gut microbiota of healthy hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, including asymptomatic and non-cirrhotic subjects, have been rarely scrutinized. From 1463 faecal samples in health examinees, in total 112 subjects, including 36 hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive and 76 control subjects, were included. Twenty-eight of 36 HBsAg-positive individuals (78%) showed normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (normal ALT group), whereas eight subjects exhibited elevated ALT levels (22%, high ALT group). By using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the distance between normal and high ALT groups among HBsAg-positive subjects showed a significant separation after the pairwise comparison of weighted UniFrac distance (permutational analysis of variance <i>q</i>-value = 0.039), when compared with the distances to the control group. In comparison with the control group, the normal ALT group had <i>Anaerostipes</i> as a significant taxon that showed a positive association (Coefficient (<i>Coef.</i>) = 0.028, <i>q</i> = 0.039). <i>Desulfovibrio</i> (<i>Coef.</i> = 0.54, <i>q</i> = 0.014) and <i>Megasphaera</i> (<i>Coef.</i> = 1.41, <i>q</i> = 0.030) showed positive correlations, and <i>Acidaminococcus</i> (<i>Coef.</i> = -1.31, <i>q</i> = 4.15 × 10<sup>-75</sup>) exhibited a negative correlation with high ALT level. Gut microbial composition was different according to HBV-induced serum ALT levels, indicative of a potential link between gut and liver metabolism."
