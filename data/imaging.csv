30727027,imaging,"To evaluate the presence of a parallel artery and vein on color Doppler ultrasound as a predictor of benignity in solid breast masses. This prospective study included all patients with solid breast masses identified by ultrasound at our center from January 2012 through December 2015. All masses were studied with B mode and color Doppler ultrasound. We calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value, and their respective 95% confidence intervals for the parallel vessel sign against the histologic findings or 2 years' follow-up without changes. A total of 526 solid masses were included in the 3-year period; the parallel vessel sign was observed in 377 (71.6%). We found 74.8% (95% CI: 70.9-78.7) sensitivity, 65% (95% CI: 50.2-79.7) specificity, 96.2% (95% CI: 94.3-98.1) positive predictive value, and 17.5% (95% CI: 11.4-23.6) negative predictive value. Of the 379 masses classified as breast imaging reporting and data system (BI-RADS) 3, the parallel vessel sign was observed in 275 (72.5%); all of these were definitively benign. Of the 109 masses classified as BI-RADS 4, the parallel vessel sign was observed in 89 (80.7%); 88 (98.8%) of these were definitively benign. Of the 38 masses classified as BI-RADS 5, the parallel vessel sign was observed in 13 (34.2%); all of these were definitively malignant. The parallel artery and vein sign is a good predictor of benignity, although it must be analyzed together with other morphologic descriptors."
30727024,imaging,"Artificial neural networks are machine-learning algorithms designed to analyse data without a pre-existing hypothesis as to any associations that may exist. This technique has not previously been applied to the risk stratification of patients referred with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Current assessment is usually with a points-based clinical score, which may be combined with a D-dimer blood test. A neural network was trained to risk-stratify patients presenting with suspected DVT and its performance compared with existing tools. Data from 11 490 cases of suspected DVT presenting consecutively between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2017 were analysed, and 7080 for whom all components of the Wells' score, a D-dimer and an ultrasound result were available were included in the analysis. The data were broken into a training set of 5270 patients, used to develop the algorithm, and a testing set of 1810 patients to assess performance of the trained algorithm. This network was able to exclude DVT without the need for ultrasound in significantly more patients than existing risk assessment scores, whilst retaining very low false negatives rates. More generally, this approach may improve the analysis of complex data to support decision-making in other areas of clinical medicine."
30727019,imaging,"The purpose of this study was to assess potential gender differences in size of the lateral and medial trochlea of the male and female knee as well as the variation within gender of potential osteochondral autograft transfer (OAT) donor site area. Two hundred and twelve skeletally mature patients, 106 males and 106 females, who underwent a 3T magnetic resonance imaging of the knee for a variety of indications were utilized for analysis. Exclusion criteria included degenerative arthritis, trochlear dysplasia, and poor image quality. Medial and lateral femoral trochlear cartilage width was obtained using a linear radiologic measurement tool. Widths were measured from a reproducible anatomic location representing the maximal trochlear dimension in a region where donor plugs are commonly harvested. Trochlear width was also plotted as a function of patient height. Statistical analysis was performed using a two-sample <i>t</i>-test. The mean and standard deviation of the lateral trochlear cartilage width (mm) for males and females were 23.38 +/- 2.14 and 20.44 +/- 2.16, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.00001). The mean and standard deviation of the medial trochlear cartilage width (mm) for males and females were 14.16 +/- 2.17 and 11.78 +/- 2.03, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.00001). The overall range in trochlear width for both the lateral and medial sides was 22.22 and 19.73 mm for males and females, respectively. A graft measuring 10 mm could represent as little as 34% of the lateral trochlea in males versus as much as 65% in females. Our results indicate that donor OAT plug diameter relative to available trochlear cartilage width will vary significantly both between genders and individual patients. Trochlear width variability and its potential implications on donor site morbidity may be an important consideration when contemplating osteochondral plug harvest for OAT or other indications. The level of evidence is IV."
30727016,imaging,"Revision anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction is a technically demanding enterprise. Management of widened or previously malpositioned tunnels is challenging and often requires innovative approaches. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the function and clinical results of revision single-stage ACL surgery using an anterolateral tibial tunnel (ALTT). A consecutive series of knees with arthroscopic ACL revision surgery were analyzed prospectively between April 2012 and September 2015. Among the 93 patients presented with revision ACL reconstruction, 25 patients met the study inclusion criteria for the ALTT technique and were followed up for a minimum of 2 years (range: 24-51 months). The clinical results were evaluated by means of the Lysholm score, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, and Tegner activity level scale, and the knee stability was assessed by the Lachman test, pivot shift test, and anterior drawer test. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the index knee before the surgery and 2 years after revision surgery was assessed. The mean IKDC subjective score, mean Tegner activity level scale, and mean Lysholm score significantly improved in all study participants. This study showed that ACL revision surgery with ALTT can reliably restore stability and provide fair functional outcomes in patients with ACL retear. One could expect acceptable lateral tibial tunnel length compared with medial tibial tunnel in classic ACL revision, intact bony surround, and good graft fixation. This technique is clinically relevant in that making an anterolateral tunnel in one-stage ACL revision surgery had a good subjective result with low complication rate in midterm follow-up."

Despite antibiotic treatment he continued to deteriorate. Brain imaging with computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging revealed a left otomastoiditis with osteomyelitis of the skull base, associated with an adjacent subdural empyema. He was also found to have a venous sinus thrombosis, most likely secondary to otitis media. He was managed with intravenous antibiotics, anticoagulation, grommet insertion and a hearing aid and he made a good recovery. This case reminds us to consider otitis media in older patients who present with hearing loss and fever. Otitis media can lead to serious complications including subdural empyema and osteomyelitis of the skull base."
30726864,imaging,"Neuroimaging studies have consistently shown distributed brain anomalies in epilepsy syndromes associated with a focal structural lesion, particularly mesiotemporal sclerosis. Conversely, a system-level approach to focal cortical dysplasia has been rarely considered, likely due to methodological difficulties in addressing variable location and topography. Given the known heterogeneity in focal cortical dysplasia histopathology, we hypothesized that lesional connectivity consists of subtypes with distinct structural signatures. Furthermore, in light of mounting evidence for focal anomalies impacting whole-brain systems, we postulated that patterns of focal cortical dysplasia connectivity may exert differential downstream effects on global network topology. We studied a cohort of patients with histologically verified focal cortical dysplasia type II (n = 27), and age- and sex-matched healthy controls (n = 34). We subdivided each lesion into similarly sized parcels and computed their connectivity to large-scale canonical functional networks (or communities). We then dichotomized connectivity profiles of lesional parcels into those belonging to the same functional community as the focal cortical dysplasia (intra-community) and those adhering to other communities (inter-community). Applying hierarchical clustering to community-reconfigured connectome profiles identified three lesional classes with distinct patterns of functional connectivity: decreased intra- and inter-community connectivity, a selective decrease in intra-community connectivity, and increased intra- as well as inter-community connectivity. Hypo-connectivity classes were mainly composed of focal cortical dysplasia type IIB, while the hyperconnected lesions were type IIA. With respect to whole-brain networks, patients with hypoconnected focal cortical dysplasia and marked structural damage showed only mild imbalances, while those with hyperconnected subtle lesions had more pronounced topological alterations. Correcting for interictal epileptic discharges did not impact connectivity patterns. Multivariate structural equation analysis provided a mechanistic model of such complex, diverging interactions, whereby the focal cortical dysplasia structural makeup shapes its functional connectivity, which in turn modulates whole-brain network topology."

Computed tomography on day15 revealed right upper lobe consolidation. Because the β-D glucan and Aspergillus galactomannan antigen tests were negative, we considered pulmonary mucormycosis as a breakthrough infection under voriconazole administration. Liposomal amphotericin B was initiated, and the patient underwent unrelated bone marrow transplantation although not in complete remission. She developed right shoulder pain on day1, and her pneumonia worsened on day3. She reported right lower extremity paralysis on day15, and developed bilateral lower extremity motor and sensory paralysis the next day. T2-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging revealed hyperdense lesions in the spinal cord at Th11. Transverse myelitis was diagnosed, and she underwent antiviral therapy. After engraftment, she died of pneumonia on day24. Postmortem examination revealed disseminated mucormycosis involving the lungs, liver, diaphragm, blood vessels, and dura matter of the spinal cord; it also revealed that the sudden bilateral lower extremity paralysis was caused by disseminated mucormycosis. This case stresses the possibility of mucormycosis, particularly in prolonged neutropenic patients with pain, fever, and focal neurological findings."

30726779,imaging,"Cardiac SPECT continues to play a critical role in detecting and managing cardiovascular disease, in particularly coronary artery disease (CAD) (Jaarsma et al., 2012; Agostini et al., 2016). While conventional dual-head SPECT scanners using parallel-hole collimators and scintillation crystals with photomultiplier tubes are still the workhorse of cardiac SPECT, they have the limitations of low photon sensitivity (~130 count s-1 MBq-1), poor image resolution (~15 mm) (Imbert et al., 2012), relatively long acquisition time, inefficient use of the detector, high radiation dose, etc. Recently our field observed an exciting growth of new developments of dedicated cardiac scanners and collimators, as well as novel imaging algorithms for quantitative cardiac SPECT. These developments have opened doors to new applications with potential clinical impact, including ultra-low-dose imaging, absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow (MBF) and coronary flow reserve (CFR), multi-radionuclide imaging, and improved image quality as a result of attenuation, scatter, motion, and partial volume corrections. In this article, we review the recent advances in cardiac SPECT instrumentation and imaging methods. This review mainly focuses on the most recent developments published since 2012 and points to the future of cardiac SPECT from an imaging physics perspective."
30726771,imaging,"Tumour-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a rare para-neoplastic syndrome characterized by recalcitrant hypophosphatemia. Reports from the Indian subcontinent are scarce, with most being single center experiences involving few patients. Herein, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 30 patients of TIO diagnosed at three tertiary care hospitals in India. Patients with persistent hypophosphatemia (despite correction of hypovitaminosis D), normocalcemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, low TmP/GFR and elevated or ""inappropriately normal"" FGF23 levels were labeled as having TIO. They were sequentially subjected to functional followed by anatomical imaging. Patients with a well-localized tumor underwent excision; others were put on phosphorous and calcitriol supplementation. The mean age at presentation was 39.6 years with female:male ratio of 3:2. Bone pain (83.3%) and proximal myopathy (70%) were the chief complaints; 40% of cases had fractures. The mean delay in diagnosis was 3.8 years. Tumors were clinically detectable in 4 patients (13.3%). The mean serum phosphate was 0.50 mmol/L with a median serum FGF23 level of 518 RU/ml. Somatostatin-receptor based scintigraphy was found to be superior to FDG-PET in tumor localization. Lower extremities were the most common site of the tumor (72%). Tumor size was positively correlated with serum FGF23 levels. Twenty-two patients underwent tumor resection and 16 of them had phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors. Surgical excision led to cure in 72.7% of patients whereas disease persistence and disease recurrence were seen in 18.2% and 9.1% of cases, respectively. At the last follow-up, serum phosphate in the surgically treated group was significantly higher than in the medically managed group."
30726733,imaging,"Neural crest (NC) cells undergo extensive migrations during development. Here, we couple in vivo live imaging at high resolution with custom software tools to reveal dynamic migratory behavior in chick embryos. Trunk NC cells migrate as individuals with both stochastic and biased features as they move dorsoventrally to form peripheral ganglia. Their leading edge displays a prominent fan-shaped lamellipodium that reorients upon cell-cell contact. Computational analysis reveals that when the lamellipodium of one cell touches the body of another, the two cells undergo ""contact attraction,"" often moving together and then separating via a pulling force exerted by lamellipodium. Targeted optical manipulation shows that cell interactions coupled with cell density generate a long-range biased random walk behavior, such that cells move from high to low density. In contrast to chain migration noted at other axial levels, the results show that individual trunk NC cells navigate the complex environment without tight coordination between neighbors."

The sequences of all isolates were identical to Echinococcus multilocularis; all nad1 sequences have been deposited in GenBank The histopathological examination revealed Passpositive fragments of laminated layers typical for E. multilocularis metacestode. Obtained results confirm that the use of imaging techniques only may be insufficient to diagnose alveococcosis thus the recognition of the zoonosis should base on several procedures; especially valuable are highly sensitive and specific molecular methods."

30726525,imaging,"Bobble-head doll syndrome is a rare movement disorder that is usually associated with lesions involving the third ventricle. It is characterised by stereotypical rhythmic up-and-down or side-to-side head movements. The pathophysiology and anatomical basis for this unusual manifestation is still a subject of intense scrutiny. The syndrome has never been described in a patient with both hydranencephaly and Chiari type 3 malformation. We describe a 2-year-old female patient who presented with congenital hydrocephalus, an occipital encephalocele and rhythmic bobbling of the head. Imaging investigation revealed a Chiari type 3 malformation and hydranencephaly. The patient was taken to theatre for a ventriculoperitoneal shunt insertion, and at day 3 post operatively, the patient had a markedly decreased head circumference and a decrease in the frequency of the bobbling of the head. A further review at 2 weeks showed that the bobbling of the head had ceased. Although the pathophysiology of bobble-head doll syndrome is yet to be fully understood, there has been postulation of either a third ventricular enlargement or a cerebellar dysfunction to explain bobble-head doll syndrome. Our case illustrates that the pathophysiology is most likely multifactorial as illustrated by the fact that by just addressing the high intracranial pressure with a shunt was sufficient to treat the condition."

Here, we report on a patient with neurofibromatosis type 1 and a history of spontaneous abortions presenting with sudden vision loss in the right eye and swelling of the optic nerve head. Fluorescein angiography indicated anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Brain magnetic resonance imaging revealed findings consistent with left cavernous sinus meningioma. Serologic testing demonstrated persistently elevated anti-b2-glycoprotein antibodies. Her findings suggested antiphospholipid syndrome with concomitant clinical and laboratory evidence of antiphospholipid syndrome: frequent abortions, a vaso-occlusive episode, and persistently elevated antiphospholipid syndrome antibodies.

30726312,imaging,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a chronic disease of unknown etiology that usually has a progressive course and is commonly associated with a poor prognosis. The main symptoms of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, including progressive dyspnea and dry cough, are often nonspecific. Chest high-resolution computed tomography is the primary modality used in the initial assessment of patients with suspected idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and may have considerable influence on subsequent management decisions. The main role of computed tomography is to distinguish chronic fibrosing lung diseases with a usual interstitial pneumonia pattern from those presenting with a non-usual interstitial pneumonia pattern, suggesting an alternative diagnosis when possible. A usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on chest tomography is characterized by the presence subpleural and basal predominance, reticular abnormality honeycombing with or without traction bronchiectasis, and the absence of features suggestive of an alternative diagnosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis can be diagnosed according to clinical and radiological criteria in approximately 66.6% of cases. Confirmation of an idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis diagnosis is challenging, requiring the exclusion of pulmonary fibroses with known causes, such as asbestosis, connective tissue diseases, drug exposure, chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis, and other forms of idiopathic interstitial pneumonitis. The histopathological hallmark of usual interstitial pneumonia is a heterogeneous appearance, characterized by areas of fibrosis with scarring and honeycombing alternating with areas of less affected or normal parenchyma. The aim of this article was to review the clinical, radiological, and pathological features of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and of diseases that might mimic idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis presentation."
30726298,imaging,"Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) imaging is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique widely used in clinical applications for various organs. However, IVIM imaging at low b-values is a persistent problem. This paper aims to investigate in a systematic and detailed manner how the number of low b-values influences the estimation of IVIM parameters. To this end, diffusion-weighted (DW) data with different low b-values were simulated to get insight into the distributions of subsequent IVIM parameters. Then, in vivo DW data with different numbers of low b-values and different number of excitations (NEX) were acquired. Finally, least-squares (LSQ) and Bayesian shrinkage prior (BSP) fitting methods were implemented to estimate IVIM parameters. The influence of the number of low b-values on IVIM parameters was analyzed in terms of relative error (RE) and structural similarity (SSIM). The results showed that the influence of the number of low b-values on IVIM parameters is variable. LSQ is more dependent on the number of low b-values than BSP, but the latter is more sensitive to noise."

30726257,imaging,"Diffusion MRI derives its contrast from MR signal attenuation induced by the movement of water molecules in microstructural environments. Associated with the signal attenuation is the reduction of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Methods based on total variation (TV) have shown superior performance in image noise reduction. However, TV denoising can result in stair-casing effects due to the inherent piecewise-constant assumption. In this paper, we propose a tight wavelet frame based approach for edge-preserving denoising of diffusion-weighted (DW) images. Specifically, we employ the unitary extension principle (UEP) to generate frames that are discrete analogues to differential operators of various orders, which will help avoid stair-casing effects. Instead of denoising each DW image separately, we collaboratively denoise groups of DW images acquired with adjacent gradient directions. In addition, we introduce a very efficient method for solving an ℓ0 denoising problem that involves only thresholding and solving a trivial inverse problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method qualitatively and quantitatively using synthetic and real data."
30726252,imaging,"Nearly 90% of cervical cancer cases and deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries that lack comprehensive national HPV immunization and cervical cancer screening programs. In these settings, it is difficult to implement screening programs due to a lack of infrastructure and shortage of trained personnel. Screening programs based on visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) have been successfully implemented in some low-resource settings. However, VIA has poor specificity and up to 90% of patients receiving treatment based on a positive VIA exam are over-treated. A number of studies have suggested that high-resolution cervical imaging to visualize nuclear morphology in vivo can improve specificity by better distinguishing precancerous and benign lesions. To enable high-resolution imaging in low-resource settings, we developed a portable, low-cost, high-resolution microendoscope that uses a mobile phone to detect and display images of cervical epithelium in vivo with subcellular resolution. The device was fabricated for less than $2,000 using commercially available optical components including filters, an LED and triplet lenses assembled in a 3D-printed opto-mechanical mount. We show that the mobile high-resolution microendoscope achieves similar resolution and signal-to-background ratio as previously reported high-resolution microendoscope systems using traditional cameras and computers to detect and display images. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of the mobile high-resolution microendoscope to image normal and precancerous squamous epithelium of the cervix in vivo in a gynecological referral clinic in Barretos, Brazil."
30726243,imaging,"There has been significant progress in recent years aimed at the development of new analytical techniques for investigating structure-function relationships in hierarchically ordered materials. Inspired by these technological advances and the potential for applying these approaches to the study of construction materials from antiquity, we present a new set of high throughput characterization tools for investigating ancient Roman concrete, which like many ancient construction materials, exhibits compositional heterogeneity and structural complexity across multiple length scales. The detailed characterization of ancient Roman concrete at each of these scales is important for understanding its mechanics, resilience, degradation pathways, and for making informed decisions regarding its preservation. In this multi-scale characterization investigation of ancient Roman concrete samples collected from the ancient city of Privernum (Priverno, Italy), cm-scale maps with micron-scale features were collected using multi-detector energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and confocal Raman microscopy on both polished cross-sections and topographically complex fracture surfaces to extract both bulk and surface information. Raman spectroscopy was used for chemical profiling and phase characterization, and data collected using EDS was used to construct ternary diagrams to supplement our understanding of the different phases. We also present a methodology for correlating data collected using different techniques on the same sample at different orientations, which shows remarkable potential in using complementary characterization approaches in the study of heterogeneous materials with complex surface topographies."
30726222,imaging,"Motor skills and the acquisition of brain plasticity are important topics in current research. The development of non-invasive white matter imaging technology, such as diffusion-tensor imaging and the introduction of graph theory make it possible to study the effects of learning skills on the connection patterns of brain networks. However, few studies have characterized the brain network topological features of motor skill learning, especially open skill. Given the need to interact with environmental changes in real time, we hypothesized that the brain network of high-level open-skilled athletes had higher transmission efficiency and stronger interaction in attention, visual and sensorimotor networks. We selected 21 high-level basketball players and 25 ordinary individuals as control subjects, collected their DTI data, built a network of brain structures, and used graph theory to analyze and compare the network properties of the two groups at global and regional levels. In addition, we conducted a correlation analysis on the training years of high-level athletes and brain network nodal parameters on the regional level to assess the relationship between brain network topological characteristics and skills learning. We found that on the global-level, the brain network of high-level basketball players had a shorter path length, small-worldness, and higher global efficiency. On the regional level, the brain nodes of the high-level athletes had nodal parameters that were significantly higher than those of control groups, and were mainly distributed in the visual network, the default mode network, and the attention network. The changes in brain node parameters were significantly related to the number of training years."
30726221,imaging,"The locus coeruleus is a small brainstem nucleus which contains neuromelanin cells and is involved in a number of cognitive functions such as attention, arousal and stress, as well as several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Locus coeruleus imaging in vivo is generally performed using a T1-weighted turbo spin echo MRI sequence at 3 Tesla (T). However, imaging at high magnetic field strength can increase the signal-to-noise ratio and offers the possibility of imaging at higher spatial resolution. Therefore, in the present study we explored the possibility of visualizing the locus coeruleus at 7T. To this end, twelve healthy volunteers participated in three scanning sessions: two with 3T MRI and one with 7T MRI. The volumes of the first 3T session were used to segment the locus coeruleus, whereas the volumes of the second 3T and the 7T session were used to quantify the contrast of the locus coeruleus with several reference regions across eight different structural sequences. The results indicate that several of the 7T sequences provide detectable contrast between the locus coeruleus and surrounding tissue. Of the tested sequences, a T1-weighted sequence with spectral presaturation inversion recovery (SPIR) seems the most promising method for visualizing the locus coeruleus at ultra-high field MRI. While there is insufficient evidence to prefer the 7T SPIR sequence over the 3T TSE sequence, the isotropic voxels at 7T are an important advantage when visualizing small structures such as the locus coeruleus."
30726184,imaging,"Background and Purpose- The effect of leptomeningeal collaterals for acute ischemic stroke patients with large vessel occlusion in the late window (>6 hours from last known normal) remains unknown. We sought to determine if collateral status on baseline computed tomography angiography impacted neurological outcome, ischemic core growth, and moderated the effect of endovascular thrombectomy in the late window. Methods- This is a prespecified analysis of DEFUSE 3 (Endovascular Therapy Following Imaging Evaluation for Ischemic Stroke). We included patients with computed tomography angiography as their baseline imaging and rated collateral status using the validated scales described by Tan and Maas. The primary outcome is functional independence (modified Rankin scale score of ≤2). Additional outcomes include the full range of the modified Rankin scale, baseline ischemic core volume, change from baseline in the ischemic core volume at 24 hours, and death at 90 days. Results- Of the 130 patients in our cohort, 33 (25%) had poor collaterals and 97 (75%) had good collaterals. There was no difference in the rate of functional independence with good versus poor collaterals in unadjusted analysis (30% versus 39%; P=0.3) or after adjustment for treatment arm (odds ratio [95% CI], 0.61 [0.26-1.45]). Good collaterals were associated with significantly smaller ischemic core volume and less ischemic core growth. The difference in the treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy was not significant ( P=0.8). Collateral status also did not affect the rate of stroke-related death (n [%], good versus poor collaterals, 18/97 [19%] versus 8/33 [24%], P=0.5]. Conclusions- In DEFUSE 3 patients, good leptomeningeal collaterals on single phase computed tomography angiography were not predictive of functional independence or death and did not impact the treatment effect of endovascular thrombectomy. These unexpected findings require further study to confirm their validity and to better understand the role of collaterals for stroke patients with anterior circulation large vessel occlusion in the late therapeutic window.

Here, we report the radiolabeling, pharmacokinetic evaluation, and determination of tumor targeting capacity of the previously validated anti-CEA MFE23-scFv-based N-terminal trimerbody (MFE23N-trimerbody), and the results are compared to those obtained for the monomeric MFE23-scFv. Dissection and gamma-counting studies performed with the 131I-labeled protein scaffolds in normal mice showed slower blood clearance for the trimerbody, and accumulation in the kidneys, the spleen and the liver for both species. These, together with a progressive uptake in the small intestine, confirm a combined elimination scheme with hepatobiliary and urinary excretion. Positron emission tomography studies performed in a xenograft mouse model of human gastric adenocarcinoma, generated by subcutaneous administration of CEA-positive human MKN45 cells, showed higher tumor accumulation and tumor-to-muscle (T/M) ratios for 124I-labeled MFE23N-trimerbody than for MFE23-scFv. Specific uptake was not detected with PET imaging in CEA negative xenografts as indicated by low T/M ratios. Our data suggest that engineered intermediate-sized trivalent antibody fragments could be promising candidates for targeted therapy and imaging of CEA-positive tumors."
30726092,imaging,"The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is involved in depression, alcoholism and drug abuse. The current agonist radiotracer <sup>11</sup>C-GR103545 is not ideal for imaging KOR due to its slow tissue kinetics in human. The aim of our project was to develop novel KOR agonist radiotracers with improved imaging properties. A novel compound FEKAP (( R)-4-(2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)acetyl)-3-((ethyl(2-fluoroethyl)amino)methyl) piperazine-1-carboxylate) was designed, synthesized and assayed for in vitro binding affinities. It was then radiolabeled and evaluated in rhesus monkeys. Baseline and blocking scans were conducted on a Focus-220 scanner to assess binding specificity and selectivity. Metabolite-corrected arterial activities over time were measured and used as input functions to analyze the brain regional time-activity curves and derive kinetic and binding parameters with kinetic modeling. FEKAP displayed high KOR binding affinity ( K<sub>i</sub> = 0.43 nM) and selectivity (17 folds over mu opioid receptor and 323 folds over delta opioid receptor) in vitro. <sup>11</sup>C-FEKAP was prepared in high molar activity (mean of 718 GBq/μmol, n = 19) and > 99% radiochemical purity. In monkeys <sup>11</sup>C-FEKAP metabolized fairly fast, with ~31% of parent fraction at 30 min post-injection. In the brain it exhibited fast and reversible kinetics with good uptake. Pre-treatment with the non-selective opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) decreased uptake in high binding regions to the level in the cerebellum, and the selective KOR antagonist LY2456302 (0.02 & 0.1 mg/kg) reduced <sup>11</sup>C-FEKAP specific binding in a dose-dependent manner. As a measure of specific binding signals, the mean binding potential (BPND) values of <sup>11</sup>C-FEKAP derived from the multilinear analysis-1 (MA1) method were great than 0.5 for all regions except for the thalamus. The novel KOR agonist tracer <sup>11</sup>C-FEKAP demonstrated binding specificity and selectivity in vivo and exhibited attractive properties of fast tissue kinetics and high specific binding."
30726083,imaging,"The title reactions were studied at two collisional energies (Ec) in a crossed-beam product-imaging experiment. We found that all three initial CH stretching excitations suppress the reactivity toward the abstraction of the unexcited D-atom. In terms of vibrational suppression factor, σs/σg, the product channels of CH3(00/41) + DCl and CH3(11/31) + DCl show opposite mode-specific trends. On the other hand, the angular distributions of both channels are nearly identical to that of the ground-state reaction at the same Ec, regardless of the initial reactant states. Tentatively, we ascribed these two observations to a vibrational-induced narrowing effect of the attack angle near the barrier to reaction. As for the DCl coproduct state distributions, the two channels are distinct but show little mode-specific difference. When probing CH3(00), the DCl coproduct peaks at v = 1 accompanied with substantial rotational excitation, whereas the DCl products associated with CH3(11/31) are both vibrationally and rotationally cold. We attributed the different (correlated) energy disposals to a manifestation of trajectory bifurcations in the post-barrier region, with a vibrationally nonadiabatic pathway leading to CH3(00) + DCl(v = 1) and the other adiabatically to the CH3(11/31) + DCl(v =0) channel. For both pathways the initial CH stretching excitation acts as a conserved mode by preferentially retaining one quantum of vibrational excitation in the reaction."
30725538,imaging,"Objectives To study the clinical profile and outcome in patients with epilepsy who developed psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (PNES) associated with levetiracetam (LEV) use.   Methods In this prospective observational study, conducted over 1 year, 13 patients with epilepsy and PNES, documented by video electroencephalogram (VEEG) while on LEV, were included. Those with past history of psychiatric illnesses were excluded. VEEG, high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluation were performed. Patients in Group I (07) were treated with psychotherapy, psychiatric medications and immediate withdrawal of LEV while, those in Group II (06) received psychotherapy, anxiolytics and LEV for initial 2 months after which it was stopped. Follow-up period was six months. There was subsidence of PNES on discontinuation of LEV in these patients.   Results Mean (±SD) age of patients was 25 ± 12.28 years; there were 11 (84.62%) females. All were on antiepileptic agents which included LEV >1000 mg/day, except one. Mean dose of LEV was 1269.23 ± 483.71 mg/day. Three patient's scores were suggestive of depression or anxiety; one had both depression and anxiety. Eight patients had mood disorders; three had a history of emotional abuse or neglect. PNES subsided within 1-3 months and did not recur after withdrawal of LEV in any patient.   Conclusion LEV can induce PNES in susceptible populations. Awareness of this association is crucial for timely withdrawal of triggering factor and appropriate management. This will reduce inadvertent additional prescription of antiepileptic agents."

In order to identify new potent inhibitors of this enzyme, we describe herein a new structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) using the Institut Curie-CNRS chemical library (ICCL), which contained at the screening date 14307 compounds. The strategy undertaken in this work consisted of the use of several docking programs in SBVS calculations followed by the application of a consensus method (vSDC) and a scrupulous visual analysis. It allowed us to obtain a high degree of success, with a yield of almost 86 %, since 12 hits were identified among only 14 molecules tested in vitro. Still more remarkably, 6 of these hits were more active than galantamine, the reference inhibitor. These hits were predicted to have good ADMET properties. The two most promising compounds can serve as leads for AD treatment."

Dissolution dynamic nuclear polarization method increases polarization of <sup>13</sup>C-labeled molecules, typically [1-<sup>13</sup>C]pyruvate, which can be injected into an animal during MRI scanning. Increased polarization leads to a higher observed signal, which allows for the detection and imaging of the transfer of <sup>13</sup>C-label between the injected marker molecule, pyruvate, and its metabolic products, most importantly lactate.

30725465,imaging,"Altered metabolism is a hallmark of cancer, both resulting from and driving oncogenesis. The NAD and NADP redox couples play a key role in a large number of the metabolic pathways involved. In their reduced forms, NADH and NADPH, these molecules are intrinsically fluorescent. As the average time for fluorescence to be emitted following excitation by a laser pulse, the fluorescence lifetime, is exquisitely sensitive to changes in the local environment of the fluorophore, imaging the fluorescence lifetime of NADH and NADPH offers the potential for label-free monitoring of metabolic changes inside living tumors. Here, we describe the biological, photophysical, and methodological considerations required to establish fluorescence lifetime imaging (FLIM) of NAD(P)H as a routine method for profiling the metabolism of living cancer cells and tissues."
30725461,imaging,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of tumor development. A technique that can map this complex biochemical shift by taking a snapshot of various metabolites in a tissue specimen (biopsy) is of high utility in the context of cancer diagnosis. Desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometric imaging (DESI-MSI) is such a powerful and emerging analytical technique to simultaneously visualize the distributions of hundreds of metabolites, lipids, and other small molecules in the biological tissue. In DESI-MSI, a fine spray of high-velocity charged microdroplets rapidly extracts molecular species from the tissue surface and subsequently transfers them to the mass spectrometer, while the sample is continuously moved in two dimensions under the impinging spray of microdroplets. This allows a detailed multiplex molecular mapping of the tissue. DESI-MSI enables simultaneous examination of hundreds of putative metabolic biomarkers, an approach that lends much more predictive power than simply evaluating one or a few candidate biomarkers. The speed, versatility, lack of complicated sample preparation, and operation at ambient conditions make DESI-MSI extremely promising as a rapid diagnostic and prognostic tool."
30725457,imaging,"Due to their role in cellular structure, energetics, and signaling, characterization of changes in cellular and extracellular lipid composition is of key importance to understand cancer biology. In addition, several mass spectrometry-based profiling as well as imaging studies have indicated that lipid molecules may be useful to augment existing biochemical and histopathological methods for diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of cancer. Therefore, analysis of lipidomic changes associated with cancer cells and tumor tissues can be useful for both fundamental and translational studies. Here, we provide a high-throughput single-extraction-based method that can be used for simultaneous lipidomic and metabolomic analysis of cancer cells or healthy or tumor tissue samples. In this chapter, a modified Bligh-Dyer method is described for extraction of lipids followed by analysis of fatty acid composition by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or untargeted lipidomics using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) coupled with reverse-phase (RP) ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) followed by multivariate data analysis to identify features of interest."
30725451,imaging,"The mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ<sub>m</sub>) drives the generation of ATP by mitochondria. Interestingly, Δψ<sub>m</sub> is higher in many cancer cells comparted to healthy noncancerous cell types, providing a unique metabolic marker. This feature has also been exploited for therapeutic use by utilizing drugs that specifically accumulate in the mitochondria of cancer cells with high Δψ<sub>m</sub>. As such, the assessment of Δψ<sub>m</sub> can provide very useful information as to the metabolic state of a cancer cell, as well as its potential for malignancy. In addition, the measurement of Δψ<sub>m</sub> can also be used to test the ability of novel anticancer therapies to disrupt mitochondrial metabolism and cause cell death.Here, we outline two methods for assessing Δψ<sub>m</sub> in cancer cells using confocal microscopy and the potentiometric fluorescent dye tetramethylrhodamine methyl ester (TMRM). In the first protocol, we describe a technique to quantitatively measure Δψ<sub>m</sub>, which can be used to compare Δψ<sub>m</sub> between different cell types. In the second protocol, we describe a technique for assessing changes to Δψ<sub>m</sub> over time, which can be used to determine the effectiveness of different therapeutic compounds or drugs in modulating mitochondrial function."

30725445,imaging,"Pancreatic granular cell tumors (GCTs) are rare and making an imaging diagnosis of pancreatic GCT is difficult because it has no definite characteristics on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CE-CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) owing to varying findings. We report about a 32-year-old woman who presented with an incidental finding of a pancreatic tumor with a past history of excision of a right forearm GCT nodule 12 years ago. CE-CT revealed a 23-mm-sized homogeneous low enhancement tumor in the arterial phase in the pancreatic body. Abdominal MRI revealed a lobulated hypointense mass in T1WI and high signal in DWI. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) revealed that the tumor was oval, hypoechoic with posterior echo enhancement, and had a well-defined border. Although EUS-guided fine needle aspiration revealed benign granular cells of the pancreas, she underwent laparoscopic surgery because the metastatic tumor from the past lesion was not excluded. The pathological finding was benign GCT of the pancreas and it was considered as an original lesion. In the previous reports, most of the resected cases were considered to be pancreatic cancer or neuroendocrine tumor preoperatively. Compared to CE-CT and MRI, EUS imaging and EUS-FNA are more reliable diagnosis tools for pancreatic GCT. Although malignant GCT accounts for approximately 1-2% of all cases, surgical resection or strict follow-up should be considered because it is difficult to predict its biological behavior."

30725423,imaging,"The general cancer-specific metabolic defect of methionine (MET) dependence is due to MET overuse for aberrant transmethylation reactions. The excess use of MET for aberrant transmethylation reactions apparently diverts methyl groups from DNA. The resulting global DNA hypomethylation is also a general phenomenon in cancer and leads to unstable genomes and aneuploid karyotypes. The excessive and aberrant use of MET in cancer is readily observed in [<sup>11</sup>C]-MET-PET imaging, where high uptake of [<sup>11</sup>C]-MET results in a very strong and selective tumor signal compared to normal tissue background for brain cancer and possibly other cancers. [<sup>11</sup>C]-MET is superior to [<sup>18</sup>C]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) for PET imaging, suggesting that MET overuse in cancer (""Hoffman effect"") is greater than glucose overuse in cancer (""Warburg effect"")."

30725413,imaging,"Cancer cells are methionine (MET) dependent compared to normal cells as they have an elevated requirement for MET in order to proliferate. MET restriction selectively traps cancer cells in the S/G<sub>2</sub> phase of the cell cycle. The cell cycle phase can be visualized by color coding with the fluorescence ubiquitination-based cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) is an enzyme that effectively degrades MET. rMETase induces S/G<sub>2</sub>-phase blockage of cancer cells which is identified by the cancer cells' green fluorescence with FUCCI imaging. Cancer cells in G<sub>1</sub>/G<sub>0</sub> are the majority of the cells in solid tumors and are resistant to the chemotherapy. Treatment of cancer cells with standard chemotherapy drugs only led to the majority of the cancer cell population being arrested in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase, identified by the cancer cells' red fluorescence in the FUCCI system. The G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub>-phase cancer cells are chemo-resistant. Tumor targeting Salmonella typhimurium A1-R (S. typhimurium A1-R) was used to decoy quiescent G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> stomach cancer cells growing in nude mice to cycle, with subsequent rMETase treatment to selectively trap the decoyed cancer cells in S/G<sub>2</sub> phase, which made them highly sensitive to chemotherapy. Subsequent cisplatinum (CDDP) or paclitaxel (PTX) chemotherapy was then administered to kill the decoyed and trapped cancer cells, which completely prevented or regressed tumor growth. In a subsequent experiment, a patient-derived orthotopic xenograft (PDOX) model of recurrent CDDP-resistant metastatic osteosarcoma was eradicated by the combination of Salmonella typhimurium A1-R decoy, rMETase S/G<sub>2</sub>-phase cell cycle trap, and CDDP cell kill. Salmonella typhimurium A1-R and rMETase pre-treatment thereby overcame CDDP resistance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the new chemotherapy paradigm of ""decoy, trap, and kill"" chemotherapy."
30725407,imaging,"Cancer cells require elevated amounts of methionine (MET) and arrest their growth under conditions of MET restriction (MR). This phenomenon is termed MET dependence. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) first indicated that the MET-dependent SV40-transformed cancer cells were arrested in the S and G<sub>2</sub> phases of the cell cycle when under MR. This is in contrast to a G<sub>1</sub>-phase accumulation of cells, which occurs only in MET-supplemented medium at very high cell densities and which is similar to the G<sub>1</sub> cell-cycle block which occurs in cultures of normal fibroblasts at high density. When the human PC-3 prostate carcinoma cell line was cultured in MET-free, homocysteine-containing (MET<sup>-</sup>HCY<sup>+</sup>) medium, there was an extreme increment in DNA content without cell division indicating that the cells were blocked in S phase. Recombinant methioninase (rMETase) treatment of cancer cells also selectively trapped cancer cells in S/G<sub>2</sub>: The cell cycle phase of the cancer cells was visualized with the fluorescence ubiquitination cell cycle indicator (FUCCI). At the time of rMETase-induced S/G<sub>2</sub>-phase trap, identified by the cancer cells' green fluorescence by FUCCI imaging, the cancer cells were administered S-phase-dependent chemotherapy drugs, which interact with DNA or block DNA synthesis such as doxorubicin, cisplatin, or 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and which were highly effective in killing the cancer cells. In contrast, treatment of cancer cells with drugs in the presence of MET, only led to the majority of the cancer cell population being blocked in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase, identified by the cancer cells becoming red fluorescent in the FUCCI system. The G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> blocked cells were resistant to the chemotherapy. MR has the potential for highly effective cell-cycle-based treatment strategy for cancer in the clinic."

The objective of this study was to compare the clinical backgrounds, procedural characteristics, and outcomes of patients who underwent ASA with preprocedural CT assessment against those without CT assessment. Thirty consecutive patients with obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who underwent ASA were retrospectively included. Patients who underwent preprocedural CT (CT-guided ASA group, n = 11) were compared with patients who underwent ASA without CT (traditional ASA group, n = 19). The CT-guided ASA group had a significantly lower number of approached target vessels (1 [interquartile range {IQR}, 1-2] vs. 2 [IQR, 2-3], P = 0.036) and non-ablated target vessels (0 [IQR, 0-1] vs. 1 [IQR, 0-2], P = 0.031) than the traditional ASA group. There were no differences between the two groups in total fluoroscopy time, the amount of delivered radiation dose, and the volume of contrast medium used during the procedures. There were also no differences between the two groups in procedural success rate and improvement of left ventricular outflow tract gradient and New York Heart Association functional class at 1 month follow-up. CT had a significant impact on the ASA procedure diminishing the number of target vessels, and could be a reliable assessment modality to build its procedural strategy."

30725354,imaging,"As data on prevalence and etiology of dementia in American Indians are limited, we sought to determine rates and patterns of memory loss among American Indian veterans with vascular risk factors. Sixty consecutive outpatient American Indian veterans with a mean age of 64 years (range 50-86), without prior dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and with ≥ 2 vascular risk factors were enrolled. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Beck Depression Inventory-II were used to screen for cognitive impairment and depression. Patients with MoCA scores < 26 were referred for additional evaluation, including imaging, serology, and neuropsychological testing. Overall rates, types, and distribution of cognitive impairment were determined. Most prevalent vascular risk factors included hypertension (92%), hyperlipidemia (88%), diabetes (47%), and smoking (78%). Eight patients (13%) with severe depression were excluded, leaving 23/52 with abnormal MoCA scores (44%, 95%CI 30%-59%). Fifteen completed additional evaluation for memory loss, including four with normal MoCA scores who requested evaluation based on symptoms. Results were adjudicated as normal (4), non-amnestic MCI (4), vascular MCI (5), and vascular dementia (2). These results show that rates of undiagnosed cognitive impairment among American Indian veterans with vascular risk factors exceed rates previously published in non-American Indian cohorts. The most common etiology is vascular. Our findings support the need to improve vascular risk reduction in this understudied population."

30725292,imaging,"Primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare, chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by progressive idiopathic stricturing of the biliary system, typically leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and colonic or hepatobiliary malignancy. Its presentation is often that of asymptomatic alkaline phosphatase elevation. When symptoms are present, they typically include fatigue, pruritus, or jaundice. The diagnosis can be confirmed via cholangiography, either magnetic resonance cholangiography (MRCP) or endoscopic retrograde cholangiography if the former is inconclusive. The clinical course is marked by progressive liver disease leading to cirrhosis with its attendant complications of portal hypertension, often including recurrent episodes of cholangitis. Greater elevation in alkaline phosphatase or liver stiffness is associated with worse clinical outcomes. Management includes endoscopic treatment of symptomatic biliary strictures and evaluation of dominant strictures as no adequate medical treatment is available. Multiple medical therapies are under evaluation. Ultimately, liver transplantation may be necessary for management of decompensated cirrhosis or disabling symptoms. There is also a markedly increased risk of cancer, notably including cholangiocarcinoma and gallbladder and colorectal cancers (particularly in patients with colitis).

30725238,imaging,"Meningiomas are the most common dural tumour. They are regularly being seen as an incidental finding on brain imaging and treated conservatively. However, there are many other dural masses which mimic their appearances, including primary neoplastic processes, metastases, granulomatous diseases and infection. While some of these are rare, others such as metastases and tuberculosis arise relatively frequently in practice. Although not pathognomonic, key features which increase the probability of a lesion being a meningioma include intralesional calcifications, skull hyperostosis, local dural enhancement and increased perfusion. It is important to have an awareness of these entities as well as their main imaging findings, as they have a wide range of prognoses and differing management strategies. This review outlines several of the most important mimics along with their imaging findings on both standard and advanced techniques with key features which may be used to help differentiate them from meningiomas."

30725233,imaging,"The critical role of the hippocampus in human learning has been illuminated by neuroimaging studies that increasingly improve the detail with which hippocampal function is understood. However, the hippocampal information developed with different types of imaging technologies is seldom integrated within a single investigation of the neural changes that occur during learning. Here, we show three different ways in which a small hippocampal region changes as the structures and names of a set of organic compounds are being learned, reflecting changes at the microstructural, informational, and cortical network levels. The microstructural changes are sensed using measures of water diffusivity. The informational changes are assessed using machine learning of the neural representations of organic compounds as they are encoded in the fMRI-measured activation levels of a set of hippocampal voxels. The changes in cortical networks are measured in terms of the functional connectivity between hippocampus and parietal regions. The co-location of these three hippocampal changes reflects that structure's involvement in learning at all three levels of explanation, consistent with the multiple ways in which learning brings about neural change."
30725232,imaging,"The functional connectivity between thalamic medio-dorsal nucleus (MD) and cortical regions, especially the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), is implicated in attentional processing and is anomalous in schizophrenia, a brain disease associated with polygenic risk and attentional deficits. However, the molecular and genetic underpinnings of thalamic connectivity anomalies are unclear. Given that gene co-expression across brain areas promotes synchronous interregional activity, our aim was to investigate whether coordinated expression of genes relevant to schizophrenia in MD and DLPFC may reflect thalamic connectivity anomalies in an attention-related network including the DLPFC. With this aim, we identified in datasets of post-mortem prefrontal mRNA expression from healthy controls a gene module with robust overrepresentation of genes with coordinated MD-DLPFC expression and enriched for schizophrenia genes according to the largest genome-wide association study to date. To link this gene cluster with imaging phenotypes, we computed a Polygenic Co-Expression Index (PCI) combining single-nucleotide polymorphisms predicting module co-expression. Finally, we investigated the association between PCI and thalamic functional connectivity during attention through fMRI Independent Component Analysis in 265 healthy participants. We found that PCI was positively associated with connectivity strength of a thalamic region overlapping with the MD within an attention brain circuit. These findings identify a novel association between schizophrenia-related genes and thalamic functional connectivity. Furthermore, they highlight the association between gene expression co-regulation and brain connectivity, such that genes with coordinated MD-DLPFC expression are associated with coordinated activity between the same brain regions. We suggest that gene co-expression is a plausible mechanism underlying biological phenotypes of schizophrenia."

The presence of potential correlation of initial tumor volume and volume reduction after ICT and RCT with remission status, overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were investigated. Furthermore, reliability of approximation of the tumor volume relying on its diameter to manual three-dimensional measurement was assessed."
30725207,imaging,"The number of diagnostic imaging examinations being undertaken in the UK is rising. Due to the expensive nature of producing these examinations and the risks associated with exposing living tissue to the ionising radiation used by many of the imaging techniques, this growth comes with both a financial and a human cost.In a time of limited resources, it is important that we are able to maximise the benefits which we extract from these resources. Therefore, a broad search of the current literature was undertaken to assess our current understanding of the nature of benefit available from diagnostic radiological images.Two broad categories of benefit were identified: primary benefit (n = 470) and secondary benefit (n = 49). Primary benefits are those which are related to the justification for undertaking the imaging, e.g., abnormality detection, to assist in diagnosis or staging, or acting as an aid to clinical decision making, or intervention. Secondary benefits are those that are not related to the justification for imaging, e.g., to promote patient engagement and understanding or to facilitate communication.Existing work considering primary benefits is comprehensive. Secondary benefit, however, is less well recognised and may not be reliably realised. Use of the image to realise these benefits has far-reaching potential. Particularly, there may be underexplored benefits which access to the images may provide to patients. This represents a gap in existing research which should be addressed."
30725202,imaging,"Incidental cardiac findings are often found on chest CT studies, some of which may be clinically significant. The objective of this pictorial review is to illustrate and describe the appearances and management of the most frequently encountered significant cardiac findings on non-electrocardiographically gated thoracic CT. Most radiologists will interpret multidetector chest CT and should be aware of the imaging appearances, significance, and the appropriate next management steps, when incidental significant cardiac disease is encountered on thoracic CT."
30725193,imaging,"Congenital anterior neck masses comprise a rare group of lesions typically diagnosed in childhood. Most commonly, lesions are anomalies of the thyroglossal duct, namely the thyroglossal duct cyst, along with ectopic thyroid tissue. Although usually suspected based on clinical examination, imaging can confirm the diagnosis, assess the extent, and evaluate for associated complications. Imaging characteristics on ultrasound, CT, and MRI may at times be equivocal; differential considerations include branchial cleft cyst, dermoid/epidermoid, laryngocele, thymic cyst, lymphatic malformation, and metastatic disease. Thus, understanding of the embryologic course of thyroid development is crucial with recognition of critical landmarks such as the foramen cecum, hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage, and strap musculature to aid in the diagnosis of an anterior neck mass."
30725178,imaging,"Two-point modified Dixon (mDixon) turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence provides an efficient, robust method of fat suppression. In one mDixon acquisition, four image types can be generated: water-only, fat-only, in-phase and opposed-phase images."
30725177,imaging,"Limited dorsal myeloschisis (LDM) is characterized by a fibroneural stalk linking the skin lesion to the underlying spinal cord. On account of the external skin lesion, all LDMs are either flat (nonsaccular) or saccular, and a human tail-like cutaneous appendage has not been reported."
30725173,imaging,"Metabolic alterations have implications in a spectrum of tissue functions and disease. Aided by novel molecular biological and computational tools, our understanding of physiological and pathological processes underpinning endocrine and endocrine-related disease has significantly expanded over the last decade. Herein, we focus on novel metabolomics-related methodologies in adrenal research: in situ metabolomics by mass spectrometry imaging, steroid metabolomics by gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, energy pathway metabologenomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics of Krebs cycle intermediates, and cellular reprogramming to generate functional steroidogenic cells and hence to modulate the steroid metabolome. All four techniques to assess and/or modulate the metabolome in biological systems provide tremendous opportunities to manage neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease of the adrenal glands in the era of precision medicine. In this context, we discuss emerging clinical applications and/or promising metabolic-driven research towards diagnostic, prognostic, predictive and therapeutic biomarkers in tumours arising from the adrenal gland and extra-adrenal paraganglia as well as modern approaches to delineate and reprogram adrenal metabolism."
