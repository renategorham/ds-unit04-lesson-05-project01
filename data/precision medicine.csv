30726160,precision medicine,"The Arf and Rab/Ypt GTPases coordinately regulate membrane traffic and organelle structure by regulating vesicle formation and fusion. Ample evidence has indicated that proteins in these two families may function in parallel or complementarily; however, the manner in which Arf and Rab/Ypt proteins perform interchangeable function remains unclear. In this study, we report that a Golgi-localized Arf, Arl1, could suppress the Ypt6 dysfunction via its effector golgin, Imh1, but not via the lipid flippase Drs2. Ypt6 is critical for the retrograde transport of vesicles from endosomes to the TGN, and its mutation leads to severe protein mislocalization and growth defects. We first overexpress the components of the Arl3-Syt1-Arl1-Imh1 cascade and show that only Arl1 and Imh1 can restore endosome-to-TGN trafficking in ypt6-deleted cells. Interestingly, increased abundance of Arl1 or Imh1 restores localization of the tethering factor Golgi-associated retrograde protein (GARP) complex to the TGN in the absence of Ypt6. We further show that the N-terminal domain of Imh1 is critical for restoring GARP localization and endosome-to-TGN transport in ypt6-deleted cells. Together, our results reveal the mechanism by which Arl1-Imh1 facilitates the recruitment of GARP to the TGN and compensates for the endosome-to-TGN trafficking defects in dysfunctional Ypt6 conditions."
30726120,precision medicine,"Severe asthma affects a small proportion of asthma patients (~ 3-5%) and reflects a failure of conventional asthma medications to provide adequate control. Severe asthma is a disease of significant clinical heterogeneity, likely caused by different pathobiological mechanisms, frequently referred to as endotypes. In the last decade, multiple monoclonal therapies have been developed to target airway type-2 eosinophilic and/or allergic severe asthma. However, the underlying mechanisms of both type 2 immunity and eosinophilia (blood and airway) remain incompletely understood and offer a potential for novel therapies that target eosinophil maturation in the bone marrow and specific kinases expressed in type 2 cells, such as JAK-STAT inhibitors. Furthermore, some patients do not consistently demonstrate a type 2 disease clinical profile and display other inflammatory phenotypes at a given point in time. Targeting airway smooth muscle dysfunction, airway mucous, type-17 immunity and airway dysbiosis, may represent novel therapeutic approaches for severe asthma in the future. Unfortunately, the biomarkers for these subtypes of severe asthma are underdeveloped, rendering it difficult to conduct effective clinical trials. There are also barriers regarding the efficiency of standard clinical trials. Moving beyond these barriers will require innovation in trial design, effective partnerships with patient groups and effective multi-national trials consortia. There are current transatlantic opportunities to conduct clinical trials that could facilitate the development of common trial platforms to maximize overall efficiency and move the field of severe asthma forward."
30726072,precision medicine,"A small molecule (1) with overlapping affinity for two microRNA (miRNA) precursors was used to inform design of a dimeric compound (2) selective for one of the miRNAs. In particular, 2 selectively targets the microRNA(miR)-515 hairpin precursor to inhibit production of miR-515 that represses sphingosine kinase 1 (SK1), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P). Application of 2 to breast cancer cells enhanced SK1 and S1P levels, triggering a migratory phenotype. Knockout of SK1, forced overexpression of miR-515, and application of a small molecule SK1 inhibitor all ablated 2's effect on phenotype, consistent with its designed mode of action. Target profiling studies via Chem-CLIP showed that 2 bound selectively to the miR-515 hairpin precursor in cells. Global neoprotein synthesis upon addition of 2 to MCF-7 breast cancer cells demonstrated 2's selectivity and upregulation of cancer-associated proteins regulated by S1P. The most upregulated protein was human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (ERBB2/HER2), which is regulated by the SK1/S1P pathway and is normally not expressed in MCF-7 cells. Like triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells, the lack of HER2 renders them insusceptible to Herceptin and its antibody-drug conjugate Kadcyla. In addition to proteomics, an RNA-seq study supports that 2 has limited off target effects and other studies support that 2 is more selective than an oligonucleotide. We therefore hypothesized that 2 could sensitize MCF-7 cells to anti-HER2 therapies. Indeed, application of 2 sensitized cells to Herceptin. These results were confirmed in two other cell lines that express miR-515 and are HER2-, the hepatocellular carcinoma cell line HepG2 and the TNBC line MDA-MB-231. Importantly, normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A) that do not express miR-515 are not affected by 2. These observations suggest a precision medicine approach to sensitize HER2- cancers to approved anticancer medicines. This study has implications for broadening the therapeutic utility of known targeted cancer therapeutics by using a secondary targeted approach to render otherwise insensitive cells, sensitive to a targeted therapeutic."
30725476,precision medicine,"Macitentan is an endothelin receptor antagonist commonly used in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). A novel, rapid, simple and sensitive UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for pharmacokinetic study and the determination of macitentan in PAH patients. Macitentan and bosentan which is used as internal standard were detected using APCI in positive ion and MRM mode by monitoring the mass transitions m/z 589.1→203.3 and 552.6→311.5, respectively. Chromatographic separation was performed on reverse phase C18 column (5 μm, 4.6 *150 mm) with a isocratic mobile phase, which consisted of water containing 0.2% acetic acid:acetonitrile (90:10, v/v) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Retention times were 1.97 and 1.72 min. for macitentan and IS, respectively. The calibration curve with high correlation coefficient (0.9996) was linear range 1-500 ng/mL. The LLOQ and average recovery values were determined as 1 ng/mL and 89.8%, respectively. This method is the first UPLC-MS/MS method developed and validated for the determination of macitentan from human plasma. The developed analytical method was fully validated for linearity, selectivity, specificity, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, stability, matrix effect and recovery according to FDA guidelines. The developed method applied successfully for pharmacokinetic study and the determination of macitentan in PAH patients."

30725265,precision medicine,"Capnography involves the measurement of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) values to detect hypoventilation in patients undergoing sedation. In a previous study, we reported that initiating a flexible bronchoscopy (FB) examination only after detecting signs of hypoventilation could reduce the risk of hypoxemia without compromising the tolerance of the patient for this type of intervention. We hypothesize that hypoventilation status could be determined with greater precision by combining thoracic impedance-based respiratory signals, RESP, and EtCO<sub>2</sub> signals obtained from a nasal-oral cannula. Retrospective analysis was conducted on RESP and EtCO<sub>2</sub> waveforms obtained from patients during the induction of sedation using propofol for bronchoscopic examination in a previous study. EtCO<sub>2</sub> waveforms associated with hypoventilation were then compared with RESP patterns, patient variables, and sedation outcomes. Signals suitable for analysis were obtained from 44 subjects, 42 of whom presented indications of hypoventilation, as determined by EtCO<sub>2</sub> waveforms. Two subtypes of hypoventilation were identified by RESP: central-predominant (n = 22, flat line RESP pattern) and non-central-predominant (n = 20, RESP pattern indicative of respiratory effort with upper airway collapse). Compared to cases of non-central-predominant hypoventilation, those presenting central-predominant hypoventilation during induction were associated with a lower propofol dose (40.2 ± 18.3 vs. 60.8 ± 26.1 mg, p = 0.009), a lower effect site concentration of propofol (2.02 ± 0.33 vs. 2.38 ± 0.44 µg/ml, p = 0.01), more rapid induction (146.1 ± 105.5 vs. 260.9 ± 156.2 s, p = 0.01), and lower total propofol dosage (96.6 ± 41.7 vs. 130.6 ± 53.4 mg, p = 0.04). Hypoventilation status (as revealed by EtCO<sub>2</sub> levels) could be further classified by RESP into central-predominant or non-central-predominant types. It appears that patients with central-predominant hypoventilation are more sensitive to propofol during the induction of sedation. RESP values could be used to tailor sedation management specifically to individual patients."

Aided by novel molecular biological and computational tools, our understanding of physiological and pathological processes underpinning endocrine and endocrine-related disease has significantly expanded over the last decade. Herein, we focus on novel metabolomics-related methodologies in adrenal research: in situ metabolomics by mass spectrometry imaging, steroid metabolomics by gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, energy pathway metabologenomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics of Krebs cycle intermediates, and cellular reprogramming to generate functional steroidogenic cells and hence to modulate the steroid metabolome. All four techniques to assess and/or modulate the metabolome in biological systems provide tremendous opportunities to manage neoplastic and non-neoplastic disease of the adrenal glands in the era of precision medicine. In this context, we discuss emerging clinical applications and/or promising metabolic-driven research towards diagnostic, prognostic, predictive and therapeutic biomarkers in tumours arising from the adrenal gland and extra-adrenal paraganglia as well as modern approaches to delineate and reprogram adrenal metabolism."

30724444,precision medicine,"Kawasaki disease (KD) is a systemic vasculitis syndrome that leads to coronary artery aneurysm (CAA). While echocardiography is the most important imaging modality for coronary artery assessment, a specific diagnostic biomarker complementary for CAA has not been reported. We aimed to analyze the profiles of exosomal miRNAs extracted from the serum of KD patients and controls to identify candidate biomarkers for CAA. Serum samples from 39 healthy children, 42 CAA patients, 38 coronary artery dilatation (CAD) patients and 45 virus-infected patients including 24 EBV patients and 21 ADV patients were randomly selected. Next generation sequencing was used to analyze serum exosomal miRNA to detect differentially expressed miRNAs. Biomarker candidates were validated by qRT-PCR. One hundred (and) ninety-six differentially expressed miRNAs (DEMs) were detected in CAA patients and healthy children. There were 70 DEMs and 140 DEMs in CAA patients versus CAD patients, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, respectively. We selected the three most upregulated (let-7i-3p, miR-17-3p, and miR-210-5p) and the three most downregulated miRNAs (miR-6743-5p, miR-1246, and miR-6834-5p) in the DEMs, which were expressed differentially in CAA patients versus healthy children, and in CAA patients versus virus-infected patients, not in virus-infected patients versus healthy children, as biomarker candidates. Excluded DEMs of CAD and virus-infected patients, let-7i-3p was detected by sequence data analysis as a biomarker candidate for CAA patients, and then validated by qRT-PCR in a larger set of clinical samples. As a biomarker candidate, let-7i-3p provides an additional means of diagnosing CAA patients. Additionally, miRNA biomarkers complement ultrasonic imaging, allowing for greater diagnostic precision. © 2019 IUBMB Life, 2019."
30724425,precision medicine,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is caused by genetic alterations, and comprehensive sequence analyses have revealed the mutation landscapes. In addition to somatic changes, genetic variations are considered important factors contributing to tumor development; however, our knowledge on this subject is limited. Familial adenomatous polyposis coli (FAP) is an autosomal-dominant inherited disease caused by germline mutations in the adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene. FAP patients are classified into two major groups based on clinical manifestations: classical FAP (CFAP) and attenuated FAP (AFAP). In this study, we established 42 organoids from three CFAP patients and two AFAP patients. Comprehensive gene expression analysis demonstrated a close association between IFN/STAT signaling and the phenotypic features of FAP patients. Genetic disruption of Stat1 in the mouse model of FAP reduced tumor formation, demonstrating that the IFN/STAT pathway is causally associated with the tumor-forming potential of APC-deficient tumors. Mechanistically, STAT1 is downstream target of KRAS and is phosphorylated by its activating mutations. We found that enhanced IFN/STAT signaling in CFAP conferred resistance to MEK inhibitors. These findings reveal the crosstalk between RAS signaling and IFN/STAT signaling, which contributes to the tumor-forming potential and drug response. These results offer a rationale for targeting of IFN/STAT signaling and for the stratification of CRC patients. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
30723727,precision medicine,"Asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have overlapping clinical features and share pathobiological mechanisms but are often considered distinct disorders. Prospective, observational studies across asthma, COPD and asthma-COPD overlap are limited. NOVELTY is a global, prospective observational 3-year study enrolling ∼12 000 patients ≥12 years of age from primary and specialist clinical practices in 19 countries (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02760329). NOVELTY's primary objectives are to describe patient characteristics, treatment patterns and disease burden over time, and to identify phenotypes and molecular endotypes associated with differential outcomes over time in patients with a diagnosis/suspected diagnosis of asthma and/or COPD. NOVELTY aims to recruit real-world patients, unlike clinical studies with restrictive inclusion/exclusion criteria. Data collected at yearly intervals include clinical assessments, spirometry, biospecimens, patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and healthcare utilisation (HCU). PROs and HCU will also be collected 3-monthly <i>via</i> internet/telephone. Data will be used to identify phenotypes and endotypes associated with different trajectories for symptom burden, clinical progression or remission and HCU. Results may allow patient classification across obstructive lung disease by clinical outcomes and biomarker profile, rather than by conventional diagnostic labels and severity categories.

In past years, significant improvements in understanding disease processes, risk assessment, and prediction of clinical outcome in the field of thrombosis and haemostasis have been made by using large-scale biodatabases. These important research resources enable a comprehensive research approach by integrating clinical, environmental, genomic, and molecular information. Cutting edge, high throughput technologies open new data dimensions for clinical large-scale investigations. Joining multiple information levels from several pathophysiological pathways in contrast to a single marker approach might better model the complexity of disease pathogenesis. This review focuses on the possibilities that ultimately allow conducting wide-scale analyses for unravelling the multifaceted interplay between coagulation and cellular (e.g., platelets) elements in the development of thrombotic disease. It further provides examples for the use of biodatabases in the field of venous thromboembolism, explores the links between venous and arterial thrombotic diseases, and finally informs on the current use of platelet biomarkers in the thrombosis and haemostasis field."
30722038,precision medicine,"FBXW7, a classic tumor suppressor, is a substrate recognition subunit of the Skp1-cullin-F-box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase that targets oncoproteins for ubiquitination and degradation. We recently found that FBXW7 is recruited to DNA damage sites to facilitate nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). The detailed underlying molecular mechanism, however, remains elusive. Here we report that the WD40 domain of FBXW7, which is responsible for substrate binding and frequently mutated in human cancers, binds to poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) immediately following DNA damage and mediates rapid recruitment of FBXW7 to DNA damage sites, whereas ATM-mediated FBXW7 phosphorylation promotes its retention at DNA damage sites. Cancer-associated arginine mutations in the WD40 domain (R465H, R479Q and R505C) abolish both FBXW7 interaction with PAR and recruitment to DNA damage sites, causing inhibition of XRCC4 polyubiquitination and NHEJ. Furthermore, inhibition or silencing of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) inhibits PAR-mediated recruitment of FBXW7 to the DNA damage sites. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the WD40 domain of FBXW7 is a novel PAR-binding motif that facilitates early recruitment of FBXW7 to DNA damage sites for subsequent NHEJ repair. Abrogation of this ability seen in cancer-derived FBXW7 mutations provides a molecular mechanism for defective DNA repair, eventually leading to genome instability."
30722034,precision medicine,"Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is estimated in nearly one quarter of the world's population, and of those immunocompetent and infected ~10% will proceed to active tuberculosis (TB). Current diagnostics cannot definitively identify LTBI and provide no insight into reactivation risk, thereby defining an unmet diagnostic challenge of incredible global significance. We introduce a new machine-learning-driven approach to LTBI diagnostics that leverages a high throughput, multiplexed cytokine detection technology and powerful bioinformatics to reveal multi-marker signatures for LTBI diagnosis and risk stratification. This approach is enabled through an individualized normalization procedure that allows disease-relevant biomarker signatures to be revealed despite heterogeneity in basal immune response. Specifically, cytokines secreted from antigen-challenged peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected using silicon photonic sensor arrays and multidimensional data correlation of individually-normalized immune responses revealed signatures important for LTBI status. These results demonstrate a powerful combination of multiplexed biomarker detection technologies, precision immune normalization, and feature selection algorithms that revealed positively correlated multi-biomarker signatures for LTBI status and reactivation risk stratification from a relatively simple blood-based assay."
30721951,precision medicine,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNA molecules, have been recognized as key post-transcriptional regulators associated with a multitude of human diseases. Global expression profiling studies have uncovered hundreds of miRNAs that are dysregulated in several diseases, and yielded many candidate biomarkers. This review will focus on miRNAs in endometriosis, a common chronic disease affecting nearly 10% of reproductive-aged women, which can cause pelvic pain, infertility, and a myriad of other symptoms. Endometriosis has delayed time-to-diagnosis when compared to other chronic diseases, as there is no current accurate, easily accessible, and non-invasive tool for diagnosis. Specific miRNAs have been identified as potential biomarkers for this disease in multiple studies. These and other miRNAs have been linked to target genes and functional pathways in disease specific pathophysiology. Highlighting investigations into the roles of tissue and circulating miRNAs in endometriosis, published through June 2018, this review summarizes new connections between miRNA expression and the pathophysiology of endometriosis, including impacts on fertility. Future applications of miRNA biomarkers for precision medicine in diagnosing and managing endometriosis treatment are also discussed."
30721267,precision medicine,"Heterogeneity is prevalent in cancer both between and within individuals. Although a few studies have identified several circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) for cancer diagnosis, the complete plasma miRNA profile for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains undefined, and whether the plasma miRNA profiles are heterogeneous is unknown. Here, we obtained individualized plasma miRNA profiles of both healthy subjects and HCC patients via genome-wide deep sequencing. Compared with the highly stable miRNA profile of the healthy subjects, the profile of the HCC patients was highly variable. Seven miRNAs were optimized as potential plasma-based biomarkers for HCC diagnosis. Combined with the clinical data of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort, three out of the seven miRNAs were correlated with the survival of the HCC patients. To investigate the effect of cancer cells on the plasma miRNAs profile, we compared the most differentially expressed miRNAs between plasma and tissues. Furthermore, miRNAseq data of HCC patients from TCGA were recruited for comparisons. We found that the differences between plasma and tissue were inconsistent, suggesting that other cells in addition to cancer cells also contribute to plasma miRNAs. Using two HCC cancer cell lines, we examined the levels of seven differentially expressed miRNAs. The reverse direction of certain miRNAs alterations between cancer cells and media further confirmed that miRNAs may be selectively pump out by cancer cells."
30720794,precision medicine,"Medicine has always been characterized by a tension between the particular and the general. A clinician is obligated to treat the individual in front of her, yet she accomplishes this task by applying generalized knowledge that describes an abstract average but not necessarily a specific person. Efforts to systematize this process of moving between the particular and the general have led to the development of randomized controlled trials and large observational studies. Inclusion of tens of thousands of people in such studies, it is argued, will enhance the applicability of the data to more individual circumstances. Yet, as genetic sequencing data have become more widely obtained and used, there has been an increased focus on what has been broadly termed ""precision medicine"", a highly individualized approach to therapeutics. Moreover, advances in statistical methods have enabled researchers to use N-of-1 study data-traditionally considered too individualized to be broadly applicable-in new ways. This paper contextualizes these apparently modern debates with reference to historical arguments about methods of disease diagnosis and treatment, and earlier physicians' concerns about the tension between the particular and the general that is intrinsic to medical practice."

30719868,precision medicine,"A growing body of evidence has substantiated the significance of quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in enabling cost-effective and label-free cellular assays, which provide useful insights into understanding biophysical properties of cells and their roles in cellular functions. However, available QPI modalities are limited by the loss of imaging resolution at high throughput and thus run short of sufficient statistical power at the single cell precision to define cell identities in a large and heterogeneous population of cells - hindering their utility in mainstream biomedicine and biology. Here we present a new QPI modality, coined multi-ATOM that captures and processes quantitative label-free single-cell images at ultra-high throughput without compromising sub-cellular resolution. We show that multi-ATOM, based upon ultrafast phase-gradient encoding, outperforms state-of-the-art QPI in permitting robust phase retrieval at a QPI throughput of >10,000 cell/sec, bypassing the need for interferometry which inevitably compromises QPI quality under ultrafast operation. We employ multi-ATOM for large-scale, label-free, multi-variate, cell-type classification (e.g. breast cancer sub-types, and leukemic cells versus peripheral blood mononuclear cells) at high accuracy (>94%). Our results suggest that multi-ATOM could empower new strategies in large-scale biophysical single-cell analysis with applications in biology and enriching disease diagnostics.

30719129,precision medicine,"<b>Background:</b> Methylation plays a significant role in the etiology and pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The aim of the present study is to identify aberrantly methylated-diferentially expressed genes (DEGs) and dysregulated pathways associated with the development of HCC through integrated analysis of gene expression and methylation microarray. <b>Method:</b> Aberrantly methylated-DEGs were identified from gene expression microarrays (GSE62232, GSE74656) and gene methylation microarrays (GSE44909, GSE57958). Functional enrichment and pathway enrichment analyses were performed through the database of DAVID. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was established by STRING and visualized in Cytoscape. Subsequently, overall survival (OS) analysis of hub genes was performed by OncoLnc. Finally, we validated the expression level of CDCA5 by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and western blotting, and performed Immunohistochemical experiments utilizing a tissue microarray. Cell growth assay and flow cytometry were behaved to explore the function of CDCA5. <b>Results:</b> Aberrantly methylated-DEGs were enriched in biological process, molecular function, cellular component and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway. Among them, cell cycle was enriched most frequently, and some terms associated with cancer were enriched, such as p53 signaling pathway, pathways in cancers, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and AMPK signaling pathway. After survival analysis and validation in TCGA database including methylation and gene expression status, 12 hub genes were identified. Furthermore, the expression level of new gene CDCA5 was validated in HCC cell lines and hepatic normal cell lines through qRT-PCR and western blotting. In additional, immunohistochemistry experiments revealed higher CDCA5 protein expression from HCC tumor tissues compared with paracancer tissues by tissue microarray. Finally, through loss of function, we demonstrated that CDCA5 promoted proliferation by regulating the cell cycle. <b>Conclusions:</b> In summary, the present study implied possible aberrantly methylated-differentially expressed genes and dysregulated pathways in HCC by bioinformatics analysis and experiments, which could be helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of HCC. Hub genes including CDC20, AURKB, BIRC5, RRM2, MCM2, PTTG1, CDKN2A, NEK2, CENPF, RACGAP1, GNA14 and especially the new gene CDCA5 may serve as biomarkers for diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of HCC."
30719021,precision medicine,"The terms ""prevention"" and ""risk reduction"" are often used interchangeably in medicine. There is considerable debate, however, over the use of these terms in describing interventions that aim to <i>preserve cognitive health</i> and/or <i>delay disease progression</i> of Alzheimer's disease (AD) for patients seeking clinical care. Furthermore, it is important to distinguish between Alzheimer's <i>disease</i> prevention and Alzheimer's <i>dementia</i> prevention when using these terms. While prior studies have codified research-based criteria for the progressive stages of AD, there are no clear clinical consensus criteria to guide the use of these terms for physicians in practice.

HuH7 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells containing CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockouts were treated with 15 mM APAP for 30 minutes to 4 days. A gene expression profile was developed based on the 1) top screening hits, 2) overlap of expression data from APAP overdose studies, and 3) predicted affected biological pathways. We further demonstrated the implementation of intermediate time points for the identification of early and late response genes. This study illustrated the power of a genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screen to systematically identify novel genes involved in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity and to provide potential targets to develop novel therapeutic modalities."
30718607,precision medicine,"Conventional radiation therapy of brain tumors often produces cognitive deficits, particularly in children. We investigated the potential efficacy of merging Orthovoltage X-ray Minibeams (OXM). It segments the beam into an array of parallel, thin (~0.3 mm), planar beams, called minibeams, which are known from synchrotron x-ray experiments to spare tissues. Furthermore, the slight divergence of the OXM array make the individual minibeams gradually broaden, thus merging with their neighbors at a given tissue depth to produce a solid beam. In this way the proximal tissues, including the cerebral cortex, can be spared. Here we present experimental results with radiochromic films to characterize the method's dosimetry. Furthermore, we present our Monte Carlo simulation results for physical absorbed dose, and a first-order biologic model to predict tissue tolerance. In particular, a 220-kVp orthovoltage beam provides a 5-fold sharper lateral penumbra than a 6-MV x-ray beam. The method can be implemented in arc-scan, which may include volumetric-modulated arc therapy (VMAT). Finally, OXM's low beam energy makes it ideal for tumor-dose enhancement with contrast agents such as iodine or gold nanoparticles, and its low cost, portability, and small room-shielding requirements make it ideal for use in the low-and-middle-income countries."
30718482,precision medicine,"During meiotic prophase I, telomeres attach to and move on the nuclear envelope (NE), regulating chromosome movement to promote homologous pairing. Meiosis-specific proteins TERB1, TERB2 and MAJIN play a key role in this process. Here, we report the crystal structures of human TERB1-TERB2 and TERB2-MAJIN subcomplexes. Specific disruption of the TERB1-TERB2 or the TERB2-MAJIN interaction in the mouse Terb2 gene abolishes the telomere attachment to the NE and causes aberrant homologous pairing and disordered synapsis. In addition, depletion of SUN1 also partially disrupts the telomere-NE connection. We propose that the telomere-TRF1-TERB1-TERB2-MAJIN-NE interaction network and the telomere-LINC complex connection are likely two separate but cooperative pathways to stably recruit telomeres to the NE in meiosis prophase I. Our work provides a molecular model of the connection between telomeres and the NE and reveals the correlation between aberrant synapsis and the defective telomere attachment to the NE."

30718392,precision medicine,"Sepsis claims an estimated 30 million episodes and 6 million deaths per year, and treatment options are rather limited. Human neutrophil peptides 1-3 (HNP1-3) are the most abundant neutrophil granule proteins but their neutrophil content varies because of unusually extensive gene copy number polymorphism. A genetic association study found that increased copy number of the HNP-encoding gene <i>DEFA1/DEFA3</i> is a risk factor for organ dysfunction during sepsis development. However, direct experimental evidence demonstrating that these risk alleles are pathogenic for sepsis is lacking because the genes are present only in some primates and humans. Here, we generate <i>DEFA1/DEFA3</i> transgenic mice with neutrophil-specific expression of the peptides. We show that mice with high copy number of <i>DEFA1/DEFA3</i> genes have more severe sepsis-related vital organ damage and mortality than mice with low copy number of <i>DEFA1/DEFA3</i> or wild-type mice, resulting from more severe endothelial barrier dysfunction and endothelial cell pyroptosis after sepsis challenge. Mechanistically, HNP-1 induces endothelial cell pyroptosis via P2X7 receptor-mediating canonical caspase-1 activation in a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner. Based on these findings, we engineered a monoclonal antibody against HNP-1 to block the interaction with P2X7 and found that the blocking antibody protected mice carrying high copy number of <i>DEFA1/DEFA3</i> from lethal sepsis. We thus demonstrate that <i>DEFA1/DEFA3</i> copy number variation strongly modulates sepsis development in vivo and explore a paradigm for the precision treatment of sepsis tailored by individual genetic information."

DNA barcoding methods for botanical identification must be adequately validated to meet regulatory compliance. <i>Objective</i>: The goal of this study is to provide a validation protocol for a two-tiered DNA barcoding method that aims to identify raw botanicals. <i>Methods</i>: A barcode database was computationally validated to define the barcode combinations that can unambiguously identify botanicals in the database. A maximum variation sampling technique was used to capture a wide range of perspectives relating to DNA barcode-based botanical identification, including plant parts and species distance, for the experimental validation. Twenty-two authenticated botanicals were purposively sampled from different plant parts-covering both closely related and distantly related species-to validate the two-tiered DNA barcoding method. The performance of the method was assessed on accuracy, precision, ruggedness, and uncertainty. <i>Results</i>: High accuracy (100%) and precision (1.0) were obtained from the validation samples. The method was also found to be rugged and have acceptable uncertainty. <i>Conclusions</i>: The method was validated and suitable for DNA-based identification of botanical raw materials listed in the current database. <i>Highlights</i>: This work will provide support guidance for manufacturers and regulatory policy makers to implement equivalent validated and compliant DNA-based testing in quality control processes to improve botanical raw material identification and authentication."
30717767,precision medicine,"CRISPR-Cas12a/Cpf1, a single RNA-guided endonuclease system, provides a promising tool for genome engineering. However, only three Cas12a orthologs have been employed for mammalian genome editing, and the editing efficiency as well as targeting coverage still requires improvements. Here, we harness six novel Cas12a orthologs for genome editing in human and mouse cells, some of which utilize simple protospacer adjacent motifs (PAMs) that remarkably increase the targeting range in the genomes. Moreover, we identify optimized CRISPR RNA (crRNA) scaffolds that can increase the genome editing efficiency of Cas12a."
30717118,precision medicine,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in the United States (US), with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) being a major inherited and genetic risk factor for premature CVD and atherosclerosis. Genetic testing has helped patients and providers confirm the presence of known pathogenic and likely pathogenic variations in FH-associated genes. Key organizations, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), American Heart Association (AHA), FH Foundation, and National Lipid Association (NLA), have recognized the clinical utility of FH genetic testing. However, FH genetic testing is underutilized in clinical practice in the US for reasons that are underexplored through the lens of implementation science. In this commentary, we discuss seven key implementation challenges that must be overcome to strengthen the clinical adoption of FH genetic testing in the US. These implementation challenges center on evidence of cost-effectiveness, navigating patient and provider preferences and concerns, gender and ethnic diversity and representation in genetic testing, and establishing clinical consensus around FH genetic testing based on the latest and most relevant research findings. Overcoming these implementation challenges is imperative to the mission of reducing CVD risk in the US."
30716600,precision medicine,"A simultaneous quantitative profiling method for androgens and prostaglandins using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated to evaluate urinary androgen and prostaglandin levels. Solid-phase extraction and liquid-liquid extraction steps were combined during the sample preparation. β-Glucuronidase/arylsulfatase was also used in the enzyme hydrolysis step. Chemical derivatization was performed using 2-hydrazinopyridine for simultaneous determination of androgen and prostaglandin in the same ionization mode. The analytes were all separated and measured using multiple reaction monitoring in the positive ion mode within a run time of 22 min. The method was validated, achieving overall recoveries ranging from 81.0 to 102.9% with limits of quantification ranging from 0.01 to 2 ng/mL. The intra-day accuracy and precision ranged from 6.5 to 14.3% and from 77.1 to 106.8%, respectively. The inter-day accuracy and precision ranged from 8.9 to 18.2% and 89.9 to 101.4%, respectively. The linearity was expressed using the correlation coefficient, which was >0.99. The method developed herein was used to investigate the effects of a one-year finasteride treatment through differences in urinary androgen and prostaglandin levels between treated male pattern baldness patients and normal controls. The urinary androgen and prostaglandin levels were not significantly different between the two groups because of the administration of finasteride. The results confirmed that finasteride affects androgens and PGs related to hair regrowth and growth length, and a one-year finasteride treatment is effective for MPB. The mass spectrometry-based quantitative profiling method used herein for the investigation of male pattern baldness also holds great potential for the evaluation of androgens and prostaglandins associated with the metabolism of various inflammatory diseases."
30716590,precision medicine,"Cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes are high mortality diseases, which account for almost two thirds of all deaths worldwide. Their early detection and continuous evaluation are﻿ fundamental for an improved patient prognosis and reduced socioeconomic impact. Current biosensor technologies are typically based on the analysis of whole blood samples from patients for the detection of disease-specific biomarkers. However, these technologies display serious shortcomings, such as reduced sensitivity and dynamic range, limited in vivo applicability, and lack of continuous monitoring. There is the urgent need for new diagnostic and treatment follow-up tools, which allow for the early detection of the pathology as well as for the continuous monitoring of the physiological responses to specific therapies. During the last years, a new generation of biosensor technologies with improved performance has emerged in the biomedical sector. The combination of advanced biomaterial methods, biochemical tools, and micro/nanotechnology approaches has resulted in the development of innovative three-dimensional (3D) biosensor platforms for advanced medical diagnosis. In this review, we report the most recent advances in the field of 3D biosensors for clinical applications, focusing on the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes. We discuss about their clinical performance compared to standard biosensor technologies, their implantable capability, and their integration into microfluidic devices to develop clinically-relevant models. Overall, we anticipate that 3D biosensors will drive us toward a new paradigm in medical diagnosis, resulting in real-time in vivo biosensors capable to significantly improve patient prognosis."

30715914,precision medicine,"The emergence of biobanks has expanded the scope of biomedical research, ushering in an era of ""precision medicine"" to improve the treatment of disease. However, biobanks also face sustainability challenges comprising three dimensions-""financial,"" ""operational,"" and ""social."" The Taiwan Biobank (TWB), as a large-scale national biobank that supplies valuable phenotypic and genetic information to biomedical researchers on an application basis to investigate the relationship among personal health, genes, lifestyle, environment and diseases of the Taiwanese population, has not been sufficiently explored by researchers. Although the TWB has successfully reached a few milestones since its inception, it faces many sustainability challenges. For the next chapter of the TWB, we propose three strategies to improve sustainability. First, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched the TWB as an infrastructure project under the leadership of Academia Sinica in 2012. We now believe that it is time that the TWB is transformed into a legal entity as a nondepartmental public body. This would not only ensure efficient, effective, and flexible operation, but would also facilitate cooperation with commercial entities. Second, we suggest that the TWB integrates with other Taiwanese biobanks to reduce cost, improve low utilization, and expand specimen collection. Third, self-financing is important if funding is ceased. Besides implementing a cost-recovery model, the commodities developed by the TWB (e.g., TWB 2.0 microarray) will help increase income. After each of these strategies has been discussed in detail, this article will conclude by highlighting how these practices can help improve biobank sustainability."

30715152,precision medicine,"Crosstalk between competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) is mediated by shared microRNAs (miRNAs) and plays important roles both in normal physiology and tumorigenesis; thus, it is attractive for systems-level decoding of gene regulation. As ceRNA networks link the function of miRNAs with that of transcripts sharing the same miRNA response elements (MREs), e.g. pseudogenes, competing mRNAs, long non-coding RNAs, and circular RNAs, the perturbation of crucial interactions in ceRNA networks may contribute to carcinogenesis by affecting the balance of cellular regulatory system. Therefore, discovering biomarkers that indicate cancer initiation, development, and/or therapeutic responses via reconstructing and analyzing ceRNA networks is of clinical significance. In this review, the regulatory function of ceRNAs in cancer and crucial determinants of ceRNA crosstalk are firstly discussed to gain a global understanding of ceRNA-mediated carcinogenesis. Then, computational and experimental approaches for ceRNA network reconstruction and ceRNA validation, respectively, are described from a systems biology perspective. We focus on strategies for biomarker identification based on analyzing ceRNA networks and highlight the translational applications of ceRNA biomarkers for cancer management. This article will shed light on the significance of miRNA-mediated ceRNA interactions and provide important clues for discovering ceRNA network-based biomarker in cancer biology, thereby accelerating the pace of precision medicine and healthcare for cancer patients."
30715037,precision medicine,"Electrical nerve recording and stimulation technologies are critically needed to monitor and modulate nerve activity to treat a variety of neurological diseases. However, current neuromodulation technologies presented in the literature or commercially available products cannot support simultaneous recording and stimulation on the same nerve. To solve this problem, a new bidirectional neuromodulation system-on-chip (SoC) is proposed in this paper, which includes a frequency-shaping neural recorder and a fully integrated neural stimulator with charge balancing capability. In addition, auxiliary circuits consisting of power management and data transmission circuits are designed to provide the necessary power supply for the SoC and the bidirectional data communication between the SoC and an external computer via a universal serial bus (USB) interface, respectively. To achieve sufficient low input noise for sensing nerve activity at a sub-10 μ V range, several noise reduction techniques are developed in the neural recorder. The designed SoC was fabricated in a 0.18 μ m high-voltage Bipolar CMOS DMOS (BCD) process technology that was described in a previous publication and it has been recently tested in animal experiments that demonstrate the proposed SoC is capable of achieving reliable and simultaneous electrical stimulation and recording on the same nerve."

30714667,precision medicine,"Fibrosis is a pivotal player in heart failure development and progression. Measurements of (markers of) fibrosis in tissue and blood may help to diagnose and risk stratify patients with heart failure, and its treatment may be effective in preventing heart failure and its progression. A lack of pathophysiological insights and uniform definitions has hampered the research in fibrosis and heart failure. The Translational Research Committee of the Heart Failure Association discussed several aspects of fibrosis in their workshop. Early insidious perturbations such as subclinical hypertension or inflammation may trigger first fibrotic events, while more dramatic triggers such as myocardial infarction and myocarditis give rise to full blown scar formation and ongoing fibrosis in diseased hearts. Aging itself is also associated with a cardiac phenotype that includes fibrosis. Fibrosis is an extremely heterogeneous phenomenon, as several stages of the fibrotic process exist, each with different fibrosis subtypes and a different composition of various cells and proteins - resulting in a very complex pathophysiology. As a result, detection of fibrosis, e.g. using current cardiac imaging modalities or plasma biomarkers, will detect only specific subforms of fibrosis, but cannot capture all aspects of the complex fibrotic process. Furthermore, several anti-fibrotic therapies are under investigation, but such therapies generally target aspecific aspects of the fibrotic process and suffer from a lack of precision. This review discusses the mechanisms and the caveats and proposes a roadmap for future research."

30714292,precision medicine,"BRCA1 has been implicated in modulating metabolism via transcriptional regulation. However, direct metabolic targets of BRCA1 and the underlying regulatory mechanisms are still unknown. Here, we identified several metabolic genes, including the gene which encodes glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase 2 (GOT2), a key enzyme for aspartate biosynthesis, which are repressed by BRCA1. We report that BRCA1 forms a co-repressor complex with ZBRK1 that coordinately represses GOT2 expression via a ZBRK1 recognition element in the promoter of GOT2. Impairment of this complex results in upregulation of GOT2, which in turn increases aspartate and alpha ketoglutarate production, leading to rapid cell proliferation of breast cancer cells. Importantly, we found that GOT2 can serve as an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival of patients with breast cancer, especially triple negative breast cancer. Interestingly, we also demonstrated that GOT2 overexpression sensitized breast cancer cells to Methotrexate, suggesting a promising precision therapeutic strategy for breast cancer treatment. In summary, our findings reveal that BRCA1 modulates aspartate biosynthesis through transcriptional repression of GOT2, and provide a biological basis for treatment choices in breast cancer."
30714188,precision medicine,"The most prevalent malignancy in the oral cavity is represented by oral squamous cell carcinoma, an aggressive disease mostly detected in low-income communities. This neoplasia is mostly diffused in older men particularly exposed to risk factors such as tobacco, alcohol, and a diet rich in fatty foods and poor in vegetables. In oral squamous cell carcinoma, a wide range of matrix-cleaving proteinases are involved in extracellular matrix remodeling of cancer microenvironment. In particular, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) represent the major and most investigated protagonists. Owing to their strong involvement in malignant pathologies, MMPs are considered the most promising new biomarkers in cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The interest in studying MMPs in oral cancer biology is also owing to their prominent role in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is an intricate process involving different complex pathways. EMT-related proteins are attractive diagnostic biomarkers that characterize the activation of biological events that promote cancer's aggressive expansion. Different antioncogenic natural compounds have been investigated to counteract oral carcinogenesis, with the scope of obtaining better clinical results and lower morbidity. In particular, we describe the role of different nutraceuticals used for the regulation of MMP-related invasion and proliferation of oral cancer cells."
30714148,precision medicine,"Necrosis of a cell is defined by the loss of its plasma membrane integrity. Morphologically, necrosis occurs in several forms such as coagulative necrosis, colliquative necrosis, caseating necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis and others. Biochemically, necrosis was demonstrated to represent a number of genetically determined signalling pathways. These include i) kinase-mediated necroptosis, which depends on receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-mediated phosphorylation of the pseudokinase mixed lineage kinase domain like (MLKL); ii) gasdermin-mediated necrosis downstream of inflammasomes, also referred to as pyroptosis; and iii) an iron-catalysed mechanism of highly specific lipid peroxidation named ferroptosis. Given the molecular understanding of the nature of these pathways, specific antibodies may allow direct detection of regulated necrosis and correlation with morphological features. Necroptosis can be specifically detected by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence employing antibodyies to phosphorylated MLKL. Likewise, it is possible to generate cleavage-specific antibodies against epitopes in gasdermin protein family members. In ferroptosis, however, specific detection requires quantification of oxidative lipids by mass spectrometry (oxylipidomics). Together with classical cell death markers, such as TUNEL-staining and detection of cleaved caspase-3 in apoptotic cells, the extension of the arsenal of necrosis markers will allow pathological detection of specific molecular pathways rather than isolated morphological descriptions. These novel pieces of information will be extraordinarily helpful for clinicians as inhibitors of necroptosis (necrostatins), ferroptosis (ferrostatins) and inflammasomes have emerged in clinical trials. Anatomical pathologists should embrace these novel ancillary tests and the concepts behind them and test their impact on diagnostic precision, prognostication and the prediction of response to the upcoming anti-necrotic therapies.

30713991,precision medicine,"Cancer is a devastating disease that takes the lives of hundreds of thousands of people every year. Due to disease heterogeneity, standard treatments, such as chemotherapy or radiation, are effective in only a subset of the patient population. Tumors can have different underlying genetic causes and may express different proteins in one patient versus another. This inherent variability of cancer lends itself to the growing field of precision and personalized medicine (PPM). There are many ongoing efforts to acquire PPM data in order to characterize molecular differences between tumors. Some PPM products are already available to link these differences to an effective drug. It is clear that PPM cancer treatments can result in immense patient benefits, and companies and regulatory agencies have begun to recognize this. However, broader changes to the healthcare and insurance systems must be addressed if PPM is to become part of standard cancer care."
30713111,precision medicine,"Based on their lobule location, hepatocytes display differential gene expression, including pericentral hepatocytes that surround the central vein, which are marked by Wnt-β-catenin signaling. Activating β-catenin mutations occur in a variety of liver tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but no specific therapies are available to treat these tumor subsets. Here, we identify a positive relationship between β-catenin activation, its transcriptional target glutamine synthetase (GS), and p-mTOR-S2448, an indicator of mTORC1 activation. In normal livers of mice and humans, pericentral hepatocytes were simultaneously GS and p-mTOR-S2448 positive, as were β-catenin-mutated liver tumors. Genetic disruption of β-catenin signaling or GS prevented p-mTOR-S2448 expression, while its forced expression in β-catenin-deficient livers led to ectopic p-mTOR-S2448 expression. Further, we found notable therapeutic benefit of mTORC1 inhibition in mutant-β-catenin-driven HCC through suppression of cell proliferation and survival. Thus, mTORC1 inhibitors could be highly relevant in the treatment of liver tumors that are β-catenin mutated and GS positive."
30712878,precision medicine,"Identification of chromosomal aneuploidies and copy number variants that are associated with fetal structural anomalies has substantial value. Although whole-exome sequencing (WES) has been applied to case series of a few selected prenatal cases, its value in routine clinical settings has not been prospectively assessed in a large unselected cohort of fetuses with structural anomalies. We therefore aimed to determine the incremental diagnostic yield (ie, the added value) of WES following uninformative results of standard investigations with karyotype testing and chromosomal microarray in an unselected cohort of sequential pregnancies showing fetal structural anomalies."
30712593,precision medicine,"A novel ionic liquid (IL) modified magnetic nanocomposite (mag-MoS<sub>2</sub>-RGO), which was composed of molybdenum disulfide (MoS<sub>2</sub>) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO), was firstly synthesized and characterized (mag-MoS<sub>2</sub>-RGO-IL). Compared with mag-MoS<sub>2</sub>-RGO, the mag-MoS<sub>2</sub>-RGO-IL exhibited the higher adsorption capacity of 143.9 mg/g for methylene blue (MB) under optimum conditions. Experimental results were imitated by adsorption isotherms and kinetic models, revealing a monolayer adsorption on the homogeneous surface governed by chemisorption. The removal rate was maintained 78% after 5 cycles of regeneration, indicating its good reutilization. Methodological study suggested that the method possessed excellent repeatability, precision and stability. The recoveries from the real samples were in the range of 87.0-98.8% with relative standard deviation of ≤5.2%. Benefiting from composite structure and magnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, the stable magnetic adsorbent can be quickly separated from aqueous solution. All of above proves that the prepared mag-MoS<sub>2</sub>-RGO-IL has great application potential in dye separation."

30712469,precision medicine,"In recent years, the clinical application of circulating tumor cell (CTCs) detection has become one of the research hotspots in the field of precision medicine. CTCs detection is non-invasive, easy to obtain, can be repeatedly collected, highly repeatable and other advantages. It not only can be a real-time comprehensive monitoring of cancer treatment, but also have a large number of applications, including early diagnosis of tumor, timely evaluation of efficacy, condition monitoring, resistance factor analysis, prognosis judgment, individualized treatment of tumors, drug guidance, etc. At present, many large-scale clinical studies at home and abroad run through all stages of breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. For different treatment stages of breast cancer, the application value of CTCs detection is different. Compared with traditional detection methods, CTCs have advantages in dynamic monitoring of disease changes and efficacy evaluation in real-time. In the era of breast cancer classificational and individualized treatment, CTCs detection can provide patients with the most timely and optimized treatment plan."

30712415,precision medicine,"Personalized diagnostic testing (PDx) is a key component of the precision medicine toolkit and has shown the most development in cancer applications. Recent changes in the regulatory and legal landscapes regarding PDx development and commercialization have brought uncertainties to both intellectual property strategies and business model development. While the regulatory and legal uncertainties have been well-documented, there has been little reported analysis of the recent patent landscape and movement of IP into the PDx market. Areas covered: This article provides a snapshot landscape analysis of cancer-associated PDx US granted patents from 2014 to 2018, with a focus on claim types, biomarkers, and associated detection strategies, and assignee-specific IP portfolio analyses. Expert opinion: Patent-driven research is commonplace in the legal world for performing patentability, clearance, and validity analyses. The results from this review show that patent-driven analysis is also insightful for understanding strategies to build IP portfolios around biomarker and detection platforms, identifying partners and competitors, and driving PDx technologies into the market. This information is an important source of business intelligence and can provide companies or investors with valuable information for making strategic decisions in developing and commercializing PDx technologies."
30712389,precision medicine,"Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) is a public health burden in developing countries. Th17 cell-associated cytokines might play a role in the pathogenesis and development of RHD, but the specific molecular mechanism is not completely understood. We investigated the potential role of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 (S1PR1)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway in cardiac valve damage in a rat model of RHD. We used 20 Lewis rats divided randomly into control and RHD groups. The RHD model was constructed by injecting inactivated group A Streptococci and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA). The rats in the control group were injected with normal saline and CFA. Th17 cell-related cytokines were measured by ELISA. Fibrosis was assessed by histological examination. RT-qPCR and western blot were used to detect the expression of S1PR1 and STAT3/phosphorylated STAT3 (p-STAT3). The S1PR1/STAT3 signaling pathway was activated in the RHD model. Compared to the control group, serum levels of IL-17 and IL-21 cytokines associated with Th17 cells were increased significantly in the RHD group; the collagen volume fraction also was substantially increased. The S1PR1/STAT3 signaling pathway might be involved in RHD induced cardiac valve damage by regulating Th17 cells."
30711678,precision medicine,"We set out to investigate whether a de-novo paradigm could explain genetic causes of chronic ultra-refractory epilepsy, with onset later than the typical age for the epileptic encephalopathies. We performed exome sequencing on nine adult patients with MRI-negative epilepsy and no preceding intellectual disability. All had an onset of seizures after five years old and had chronic ultra-refractory epilepsy defined here as having failed more than six anti-epileptic drugs and currently experiencing ≥4 disabling seizures per month. Parents were sequenced to identify de-novo mutations and these were assessed for likelihood of pathogenicity based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) criteria. We confirmed the presence of functional and predicted-damaging de-novo mutations in 3/9 patients. One of these pathogenic de-novo mutations, in DNM1L, was previously reported in a patient with severe epilepsy and chronic pharmacoresistance adding to the evidence for DNM1L as an epilepsy gene. Exome sequencing is a successful strategy for identifying de-novo mutations in paediatric epileptic encephalopathies and rare neurological disorders. Our study demonstrates the potential benefit of considering ultra-refractory epilepsy patients with later onset for genetic testing. Identifying genetic mutations underpinning severe epilepsy of unknown aetiology may provide new insight into the underlying biology and offers the potential for therapeutic intervention in the form of precision medicine in older patients."

Evidence increasingly suggests that the ratio of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C/HDL-C) ratio might be a novel marker for the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but the impact of LDL-C/HDL-C ratio on 1-year prognosis of drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation patients after PCI is still not reported. Our aim of the study was to investigate the impact of LDL-C/HDL-C ratio on 1-year prognosis of DES implantation patients after PCI."
30710641,precision medicine,"Given that the blood-brain barrier (BBB) limits the exposure of therapeutics to the central nervous system (CNS), patients with brain malignancies are challenging to treat, typically have poor prognoses, and represent a significant unmet medical need. Preclinical data report osimertinib to have significant BBB penetration and emerging clinical data demonstrate encouraging activity against CNS malignancies. Here, we discuss the oncology drug candidates AZD3759 and AZD1390 as case examples of discovery projects designing BBB penetrance. We demonstrate how these innovative kinase inhibitors were recognized as brain penetrant and outline our view of experimental approaches and strategies that can facilitate the discovery of new brain-penetrant therapies for the treatment of primary and secondary CNS malignancies as well as other CNS disorders."
30710564,precision medicine,"Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) is a known tumor suppressor, which also exerts a tumor promoting activity at an advanced stage of cancer. Previously, we reported that expression of interferon consensus sequence-binding protein (ICSBP), also known as interferon regulatory factor-8, is positively correlated with TGF-β type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression in osteosarcoma patient tissues. In this study, we demonstrated that ICSBP upregulated TGF-β RI and induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition-like phenomena in human osteosarcoma cell lines. As determined by soft agar growth of osteosarcoma cells and xenografted mouse models, ICSBP increased tumorigenicity, which was reversed by ICSBP knock-down or a TGF-β RI inhibitor. To test whether ICSBP directly regulates the promoter activity of TGF-β RI, we performed a TGF-β RI promoter assay, an electro mobility shift assay, and a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. We observed that TGF-β RI promoter was activated in ICSBP-overexpressing osteosarcoma cells. Exploiting serial deletions and mutations of the TGF-β RI promoter, we found a putative ICSBP-binding site at nucleotides -216/-211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter. Our data suggest that ICSBP upregulates TGF-β RI expression by binding to this site, causing ICSBP-mediated tumor progression in osteosarcoma cells. In addition, we found a positive correlation between ICSBP and TGF-β RI expression in several types of tumors using the cBioportal database. SUMMARY: We demonstrated that interferon consensus sequence-binding protein upregulates transforming growth factor-beta type I receptor (TGF-β RI) expression by binding to nucleotides -216/-211 (GGXXTC) in the TGF-β RI promoter, which resulted in increased tumorigenicity and tumor progression in human osteosarcoma cells."
30710562,precision medicine,"A major challenge to TB vaccine development is the lack of a validated immune correlate of protection. Mycobacterial growth inhibition assays (MGIAs) represent an unbiased measure of the ability to control mycobacterial growth in vitro. A successful MGIA could be applied to preclinical and clinical post-vaccination samples to aid in the selection of novel vaccine candidates at an early stage and provide a relevant measure of immunogenicity and protection. However, assay harmonisation is critical to ensure that comparable information can be extracted from different vaccine studies. As part of the FP7 European Research Infrastructures for Poverty Related Diseases (EURIPRED) consortium, we aimed to optimise the direct MGIA, assess repeatability and reproducibility, and harmonise the assay across different laboratories. We observed an improvement in repeatability with increased cell number and increased mycobacterial input. Furthermore, we determined that co-culturing in static 48-well plates compared with rotating 2 ml tubes resulted in a 23% increase in cell viability and a 500-fold increase in IFN-γ production on average, as well as improved reproducibility between replicates, assay runs and sites. Applying the optimised conditions, we report repeatability to be consistently <5% coefficient of variation (CV), intermediate precision to be <20% CV, and inter-site reproducibility to be <30% CV; levels within acceptable limits for a functional cell-based assay. Using relevant clinical samples, we demonstrated comparable results across two shared sample sets at three sites. Based on these findings, we have established a standardised operating procedure (SOP) for the use of the direct PBMC MGIA in TB vaccine development."

We aimed to develop and validate a more accurate equation for estimated GFR (eGFR) in the Chinese population, using data from 8571 adults who were referred for direct measurement of GFR by renal dynamic imaging (mGFR) at 3 representative hospitals in China. Patients from the Third Xiangya Hospital were included in our development (n=1730) and internal validation sets (n=1042) and patients from the other hospitals comprised the external validation set (n=5799). We excluded patients who were prescribed medications known to influence the tubular secretion of creatinine, patients on dialysis, kidney transplant recipients, and patients with missing creatinine values or with creatinine >700 μmol/l. We derived a novel eGFR equation by linear regression analysis and compared the performance to 12 creatinine-based eGFR equations, including previously published equations for use in Chinese or Asian populations. In the development and internal validation sets, the novel Xiangya equation had high accuracy (accuracy within 30% [P30], 79.21% and 84.33%, respectively), low bias (mean difference between mGFR and eGFR, -1.97 and -1.85 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively), and high precision (interquartile range of the differences, 21.13 and 18.88 ml/min per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, respectively). In external validation, the Xiangya equation had the highest P30 among all eGFR equations, with P30 ≤ 75% for the other 12 equations. This novel equation provides more accurate GFR estimates in Chinese adults and could replace existing eGFR equations for use in the Chinese population."

With 3 decades of experience since the original 2-tiered Powell-Riley protocol was introduced and the role of evolving skeletal techniques and upper airway stimulation, we are pleased to present our current protocol. This update includes emphasis on the facial skeletal development with impact on function including nasal breathing, and the incorporation of upper airway stimulation. The increased versatility of palatopharyngoplasty as an adjunctive procedure is also discussed."
30709507,precision medicine,"The complement system, traditionally considered a component of innate immunity, is now recognized as a crucial mediator of the adaptive immune response in solid organ transplantation. Preclinical and early human trials have demonstrated the importance of complement effector mechanisms in driving allograft injury during specific antigraft immune responses, including ischemia-reperfusion injury, T-cell-mediated rejection, and antibody-mediated rejection, as well as a potential role for complement-derived risk stratification biomarkers. These data support the need for further testing of complement inhibitors in solid organ transplant recipients."

30709363,precision medicine,"Functionality and versatility of microprocessor-controlled stance-control knee-ankle-foot orthoses (M-SCKAFO) are dictated by their embedded control systems. Proper gait phase recognition (GPR) is required to enable these devices to provide sufficient knee-control at the appropriate time, thereby reducing the incidence of knee-collapse and fall events. Ideally, the M-SCKAFO sensor system would be local to the thigh and knee, to facilitate innovative orthosis designs that allow more flexibility for ankle joint selection and other orthosis components. We hypothesized that machine learning with local sensor signals from the thigh and knee could effectively distinguish gait phases across different walking conditions (i.e., surface levels, walking speeds) and that performance would improve with gait phase transition criteria (i.e., current states depend on previous states)."
30709212,precision medicine,"Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of the tongue contains rich physiological and biochemical information of human status. As it involves contact measurement of the tongue, preventing cross infection during measurement is an important problem to be solved. The use of sterile isolation films is a convenient and efficient way. However, these films can affect the spectral measurement results at the same time. In this paper, to study the influence of films on spectral analysis, a new modeling strategy with good robustness is proposed. The model is established by the use of spectra obtained with different thicknesses of films; thus it is insensitive to the film thickness. The experiment was conducted by gathering spectra of 35 volunteers' tongue using films of different thicknesses. First, the partial least squares method was used to reveal the relationship between the spectral data and the thickness of films. Second, the support vector machine established a classification model between the spectral data and subjects to study the influence of the film. The results showed that the model established by the new modeling strategy could minimize the error caused by variation of the film thickness."
30708356,precision medicine,"Robotic C-arm Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) systems are playing an increasingly pivotal role in interventional cardiac procedures and high precision radiotherapy treatments. One of the main challenges in any form of cardiac imaging is mitigating the intrinsic motion of the heart, which causes blurring and artefacts in the 3D reconstructed image. Most conventional 3D cardiac CBCT acquisition techniques attempt to combat heart motion through retrospective gating techniques, whereby acquired projections are sorted into the desired cardiac phase after the completion of the scan. However, this results in streaking artefacts and unnecessary radiation exposure to the patient. Here, we present our Adaptive CaRdiac cOne BEAm computed Tomography (ACROBEAT) acquisition protocol that uses the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) signal to adaptively regulate the gantry velocity and projection time interval in real-time. It enables prospectively gated patient connected imaging in a single sweep of the gantry. The XCAT digital software phantom was used to complete a simulation study to compare ACROBEAT to a conventional multi-sweep retrospective ECG gated acquisition, under a variety of different acquisition conditions. The effect of location and length of the acquisition window and total number of projections acquired on image quality and total scan time were examined. Overall, ACROBEAT enables up to a 5 times average improvement in the contrast-to-noise ratio, a 40% reduction in edge response width and an 80% reduction in total projections acquired compared to conventional multi-sweep retrospective ECG gated acquisition."

30708066,precision medicine,"In this study, methacrylated gellan-gum (GG-MA) heteropolysaccharide is proposed as a hydrogel for drug delivery and bone tissue engineering applications. Calcium-enriched beads obtained from the crosslinking of 1% (w/v) GG-MA solutions with 0.1MCaCl<sub>2</sub> were investigated, considering their intrinsic capacity to promote self-mineralization by ion binding and deposition. Indeed, when immersed in a physiological environment, the Ca-enriched beads promoted the development of a bone-like apatite layer, as confirmed by EDS and XRD chemical analysis. Additionally, the mild production process is compatible with drugs incorporation and release. After encapsulation, Dextran with different molecular weights as well as Dexamethasone 21-phosphate were efficiently released to the surrounding environment. The engineered system was also evaluated considering its biocompatibility, by means of qualitative determination of total complement activation, macrophage proliferation, cytokine release and in vitro cell culture. These experiments showed that the developed hydrogels may not stimulate a disproportionate pro-inflammatory reaction once transplanted. At last, when implanted subcutaneously in CD1 male mice up to 8 weeks, the beads were completely calcified, and no inflammatory reaction was observed. Summing up, these results show that calcium-enriched GG-MA hydrogel beads hold great potential as news tools for bone tissue regeneration and local drug delivery applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: This work describes a low-cost and straightforward strategy to prepare bioactive methacrylated gellan gum (GG-MA) hydrogels, which can be used as drug delivery systems. GG-MA is a highly anionic polymer, that can be crosslinked with divalent ions, as calcium. Taking advantage of this feature, it was possible to prepare Ca-enriched GG-MA hydrogel beads. These beads display a bioactive behavior, since they promote apatite deposition when placed in physiological conditions. Studies on the immune response suggest that the developed beads do not trigger severe immune responses. Importantly, the mild processing method render these beads compliant with drug delivery strategies, paving the way for the application of dual-functional materials on bone tissue engineering."
30708041,precision medicine,"So far multiple differences in prostate cancer-specific amino acids metabolism have been discovered. Moreover, some attempts to utilize these alterations for prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment have been made. The prostate cancer metabolism and biosynthesis of amino acids are particularly focused on anaplerosis more than on energy production. Other crucial requirements on amino acids pool come from the serine, one‑carbon cycle, glycine synthesis pathway and folate metabolism forming major sources of interproducts for synthesis of nucleobases necessary for rapidly proliferating cells. Considering the lack of some amino acids biosynthetic pathways and/or their extraordinary importance for prostate cancer cells, there is a widespread potential for targeted therapeutic applications with no effect on non-malignant cells. This review summarizes the up-to-date knowledge of the importance of amino acids for prostate cancer pathogenesis with a special emphasis on potential applications of metabolic variabilities in the new oncologic paradigm of precision medicine."

30707439,precision medicine,"Meissner's corpuscles (MCs) are cutaneous mechanoreceptors found in glabrous skin and are exquisitely sensitive to light touch. Along with other receptors, they provide continuous sensory feedback that informs the execution of fine manual behaviors. Following cervical spinal deafferentation injuries, hand use can be initially severely impaired, but substantial recovery occurs over many weeks, even when ~95% of the original input is permanently lost. While most SCI research focuses on central neural pathway responses, little is known about the role of peripheral receptors in facilitating recovery. We begin to address this by asking the following: (1) What is the normal pattern of MCs in the distal pads of all five digits in the macaque monkey (with hands similar to humans)? (2) What happens to these receptors 4-5 months following either a dorsal column lesion (DCL) or a combined dorsal root/dorsal column lesion (DRL/DCL), when functional recovery is largely complete? (3) What happens chronically, 12-14 months later? Our findings show that in normal monkeys, MCs are densest in the distal pads of the opposing thumb and index finger, with the greatest concentration on the thumb. This reflects a close functional relationship between receptor density and precision grip. At 4-5 months post-injury, there was a (~30%) loss of MCs on the deafferented digits of the injured hand compared with the contralateral side. However, 12-14 months after a DRL/DCL, receptor densities had returned to normal levels. Our findings indicate a complex peripheral response and highlight the importance of the periphery in shaping central changes. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved."
30707344,precision medicine,"Changes in reward circuitry have been studied extensively in substance and behavioural addictions. However, comparatively little is known about the neurobiology underlying impulse control disorders (ICDs) in Parkinson's disease, which show roughly similar risk factors and behavioural presentations to both stimulant and behavioural addictions. ICDs occur in a subset of susceptible patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) following intake of dopamine replacement therapy (DRT). These behavioural disorders often have debilitating effects on a patient's quality of life and increase caregiver burden. This comprehensive review examined findings of 40 neuroimaging studies of ICDs in PD to determine (a) whether there are putative neurobiological commonalities between traditional substance and behavioural addictions and DRT-induced ICD in PD and (b) opportunities for future studies to advance current neurobiological understanding of the phenomenon. Results revealed that strikingly similar (a) deficits in dopaminergic receptor expression, (b) connectivity changes in corticostriatal circuitry and (c) neural responses to cue exposure are observed in both ICDs in PD and addictive disorders. These findings point to the value of adopting a transdiagnostic approach when studying addicted populations and pave the way for demystifying this peculiar, often-devastating phenomenon in PD that has so far proven extremely difficult to treat and predict with any precision."

Assessment of a novel algorithm to determine change-of-direction angles while running using inertial sensors. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The ability to detect and quantify change-of-direction (COD) movement may offer a unique approach to load-monitoring practice. Validity and reliability of a novel algorithm to calculate COD angles for predetermined COD movements ranging from 45 to 180° in left and right directions was assessed. Five recreationally active men (age: 29.0 ± 0.5 years; height: 181.0 ± 5.6 cm; and body mass: 79.4 ± 5.3 kg) ran 5 consecutive predetermined COD trials each, at 4 different angles (45, 90, 135, and 180°), in each direction. Participants were fitted with a commercially available microtechnology unit where inertial sensor data were extracted and processed using a novel algorithm designed to calculate precise COD angles for direct comparison with a high-speed video (remotely piloted, position-locked aircraft) criterion measure. Validity was assessed using Bland-Altman 95% limits of agreement and mean bias. Reliability was assessed using typical error (expressed as a coefficient of variation [CV]). Concurrent validity was present for most angles. Left: (45° = 43.8 ± 2.0°; 90° = 88.1 ± 2.0°; 135° = 136.3 ± 2.1°; and 180° = 181.8 ± 2.5°) and Right: (45° = 46.3 ± 1.6°; 90° = 91.9 ± 2.2°; 135° = 133.4 ± 2.0°; 180° = 179.2 ± 5.9°). All angles displayed excellent reliability (CV < 5%) while greater mean bias (3.6 ± 5.1°, p < 0.001), weaker limits of agreement, and reduced precision were evident for 180° trials when compared with all other angles. High-level accuracy and reliability when detecting COD angles further advocates the use of inertial sensors to quantify sports-specific movement patterns."
30706786,precision medicine,"Malignant tumors are a major cause of death. The lack of methods that provide an early diagnosis and adequate treatment of cancers is the main obstacle to precision medicine. The C-X-C chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) is overexpressed in various tumors and plays a key role in tumor pathogenesis. Therefore, CXCR4-targeted molecular imaging can quickly and accurately detect and quantify CXCR4 abnormalities in real time. The expression level and activation status of CXCR4 are very important for screening susceptible populations and providing an accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment. In view of the fact that radionuclide-labeled peptides have become widely used for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors, this manuscript reviews the potential of different radionuclide-labeled peptide inhibitors for the targeted imaging of CXCR4- positive tumors and targeted treatment. The article also discusses the specificity and in vivo distribution of radionuclide-labeled peptide inhibitors, and translation of these inhibitors to clinic."

30706074,precision medicine,"α-L-Fucosidase (AFU) is a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of inflammation, cancer, cystic fibrosis, and fucosidosis. Some of the existing analytical methods for the assessment of AFU activity are lacking in sensitivity and selectivity, since most of them are based on spectrofluorimetric methods. More recently, mass spectrometry (MS) has evolved as a key technology for enzyme assays and inhibitor screening as it enables accurate monitoring of the conversion of substrate to product in enzymatic reactions. In this study, UHPLC-MS has been utilized to develop a simple, sensitive, and accurate assay for enzyme kinetics and inhibition studies of AFU3, a member of the AFU family. A reported method for analyzing saccharide involving a porous graphitic carbon column, combined with reduction by NaBH<sub>4</sub>/CH<sub>3</sub>OH, was used to improve sensitivity. The conversion of saccharide into alditol could reach nearly 100% in the NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction reaction. In addition, the bioanalytical quantitative screening method was validated according to US-FDA guidance, including selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy, stability, and matrix effect. The developed method displayed a good accuracy, high sensitivity (LOD = 0.05 mg L<sup>-1</sup>), and good reproducibility (RSD < 15%). The assay accurately measured an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.40 μM for the known AFU inhibitor, deoxyfuconojirimycin, which was consistent with results reported in the literature. Further validation of the assay was achieved through the determination of a high Z'-factor value of 0.89. The assay was applied to screen a marine-derived chemical library against AFU3, which revealed two marine-oriented pyrimidine alkaloids as potential AFU3 inhibitors. Graphical abstract ᅟ."

30705955,precision medicine,"<b>Background and study aims </b> Detection of polyps during colonoscopy is essential for screening colorectal cancer and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) could be helpful for this objective. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy of CAD in detection of polyps in video colonoscopy by using three methods we have proposed and applied for diagnosis of polyps in wireless capsule colonoscopy. <b>Patients and methods </b> Forty-two patients were included in the study, each one bearing one polyp. A dataset was generated with a total of 1680 polyp instances and 1360 frames of normal mucosa. We used three methods, that are all binary classifiers, labelling a frame as either containing a polyp or not. Two of the methods (Methods 1 and 2) are threshold-based and address the problem of polyp detection (i. e. separation between normal mucosa frames and polyp frames) and the problem of polyp localization (i. e. the ability to locate the polyp in a frame). The third method (Method 3) belongs to the class of machine learning methods and only addresses the polyp detection problem. The mathematical techniques underlying these three methods rely on appropriate fusion of information about the shape, color and texture content of the objects presented in the medical images. <b>Results </b> Regarding polyp localization, the best method is Method 1 with a sensitivity of 71.8 %. Comparing the performance of the three methods in the detection of polyps, independently of the precision in the location of the lesions, Method 3 stands out, achieving a sensitivity of 99.7 %, an accuracy of 91.1 %, and a specificity of 84.9 %. <b>Conclusion </b> CAD, using the three studied methods, showed good accuracy in the detection of polyps with white light colonoscopy."
30705770,precision medicine,"Liver hypoxia/ischemia injury leads to acute liver injury, delayed graft dysfunction, and failure during liver transplantation. Previous studies showed that autophagy is involved in liver hypoxia/ischemia injury. Our and others' studies have found that the damage-regulated autophagy modulator (DRAM) could induce the autophagic apoptosis. However, the role of DRAM regulating autophagy in liver hypoxia/ischemia injury remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine whether DRAM is involved in oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD)-induced hepatocyte autophagic apoptosis. Normal hepatocytes (HL-7702) were treated with OGD while Balb/c mice underwent surgery to induce 70% liver ischemia. To evaluate the role of DRAM in hypoxia/ischemia-induced hepatic injury, DRAM siRNA was used to knockdown DRAM expression in cultured hepatocytes and a recombinant adenovirus vector expressing DRAM was used to overexpress DRAM in cultured hepatocytes <i>in vitro</i> and in the liver <i>in vivo</i>. Hepatic injury was analyzed by histopathological methods and measurement of hepatocyte enzyme release. Cell apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry and TUNEL staining. Several autophagic biomarkers were observed by western blot analysis. OGD and 70% hepatic ischemia significantly induced cell autophagy, apoptosis and DRAM expression in hepatocytes <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. OGD-induced autophagic apoptosis was inhibited by 3-Methyladenine (3-MA). OGD-induced injury and autophagy in HL-7702 cells were significantly attenuated by DRAM knockdown but aggravated by DRAM overexpression <i>in vitro</i>. Similarly, DRAM overexpression increased ischemia-induced liver injury and hepatic apoptosis <i>in vivo</i>. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia/ischemia induces hepatic injury through a DRAM-dependent autophagic apoptosis pathway. These data also suggest that DRAM plays an important role in ischemia-induced liver injury and hepatocyte apoptosis."
30705439,precision medicine,"Regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, an immunosuppressive subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells characterized by the expression of the master transcription factor forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3), are a component of the immune system with essential roles in maintaining self-tolerance. In addition, T<sub>reg</sub> cells can suppress anticancer immunity, thereby hindering protective immunosurveillance of neoplasia and hampering effective antitumour immune responses in tumour-bearing hosts, thus promoting tumour development and progression. Identification of the factors that are specifically expressed in T<sub>reg</sub> cells and/or that influence T<sub>reg</sub> cell homeostasis and function is important to understanding cancer pathogenesis and to identifying therapeutic targets. Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have provided a paradigm shift in the treatment of cancer. Most immune-checkpoint molecules are expressed in T<sub>reg</sub> cells, but the effects of ICIs on T<sub>reg</sub> cells, and thus the contributions of these cells to treatment responses, remain unclear. Notably, evidence indicates that ICIs targeting programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) might enhance the immunosuppressive function of T<sub>reg</sub> cells, whereas cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors might deplete these cells. Thus, although manipulation of T<sub>reg</sub> cells is a promising anticancer therapeutic strategy, approaches to controlling these cells require further research. Herein, we discuss novel insights into the roles of T<sub>reg</sub> cells in cancer, which can hopefully be used to develop T<sub>reg</sub> cell-targeted therapies and facilitate immune precision medicine."
30705340,precision medicine,"High-grade gliomas are the most aggressive malignant brain tumors. Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods. This study indicates highly demanded effectiveness on prognosis of deep learning technique in neuro-oncological applications for better individualized treatment planning towards precision medicine."
